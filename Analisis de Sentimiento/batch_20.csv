860.Total War: Shogun 2 - Fall of the Samurai,"My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 8.. Decent expansion to a great game that adds some dept to the basic mechanics. Best game of the Total War series. Combines a modern setting the the great mechanics of the base game.. One of the most valued games of the beloved strategy game series pushed a standalone baby ""Fall of the Samurai"" out from Shogun 2. Take that golden vanilla Total War and add more advanced tactics through wider unit variety, more agents and way more firepower. Have your frontlines made of infantry rifle men, back them up with melee katana- and yari samurai, covering their flanks with some cavalry and putting explosive firepower to launch from your back lines. And with this wide unit scale you're forced to think of a whole new set of battle tactics. The campaign map itself is very similar to the predecessor with its Japanese-cartoon-styled - but a gorgeous map of Japan. They added a fresh look for the unit cards and overall the game is a blast to look at. The game is set in the mid 19th-century when the threat of Western powers forced Japan's government to modernize (and Westernize) and eventually abolish the traditional samurai-based Shogunate, and was replaced as an Emperor for Japan's leader. As for the player, he gets to choose to pledge himself for either Shogunate or Imperial Court, and the player aims to destroy the other faction. And if you will, conquer all Japan while you're at it. The Fall of the Samurai adds new tactics to the vanilla Shogun 2 via firepower, as riflemen and cannons are added, as well as Carbine Cavalry and a whole set of other new units. Besides for the samurai fighting in the midst of gunpowder smoke, and getting blown up by explosive destruction of artillery, other new cool features are in as well. Hire a geisha or two to entertain your armies or send them to seduce the enemy. All this fighting aims for the end game, where there are are only two armies at war: the Imperial Vanguard and the Shogunate forces. The other one must vanish. This is arguably one of the best TW titles, even if it's a half-priced, graphical copy-paste from a previous game that created this one.. This is the best Total War game out of those I've played (Rome, Medieval 2, Empire, Napoleon, Attila) and I always find myself coming back to it. The lasting appeal is very high. Different factions call for quite different strategies and each campaign is typically long. The wide array of technology in the units will have you trying out different combinations obsessively. The agents are fantastic and really come in handy when you're at a disadvantaged position. The AI is not the best and is probably the weak point of the game, but it's still an improvement over previous TW installments. Great graphics and sound. Learned a lot about 19th century Japan.. It actually became good after way too long time. I stopped playing before that happened. As is the destiny of every CA game in the hands of me. I don't doubt the game suffered the same fate in others hands.. Another great idea to play the fall of the samurai and put in some guns in the game. There are more new interesting aspects of the game: fights in the port and the 2 parties after realm divide. The biggest problems remain: KI is bad, especially realm divide is frustrating, because the KI is throwing everything against the player and the allies are stupid. The battles should be more interesting, because you get a new kind of units. But on the other side the battles get all the same: shooting with artillery, infantery and bows at the rear, front units attacking or defending the infantery. I prefer the battles in main game. The same in naval battles: they are better and more interesting in main game.. While it fairs far better than Empire and Napoleon a lot of the battles are rinsed and repeated if you play as an imperial faction. It can still be fun as the imperials though.. This game hardly deserves the 10 I'm giving it, because it has little replayability : all factions feel the same. Apart from that, it is in my opinion the very best TW game. How could such a game be turned into R2TW????. A decent game, but as others have pointed out, guns don't really belong in the total war series, and this game is an example of that. Guns don't offer arching and can't shoot over units, so it's really easy to rush a line of riflemen with any melee infantry, even spear levy. The result is a very quick rout. Singleplayer gets tedious really fast, Japan gets divided in two - Shogun up north, empire down south, and one has to attack over very long distances. This is where enemy's use of ships to blockade trade routes gets really annoying- the enemy keeps spamming stacks of 1-2 ships, and it's a hassle to chase them all, especially since they can magically retreat really far away most of the time. In terms of clans, there's really minimal differences between them. The shogun/empire divide is only visible in the early game, as capturing enemy settlements later on allow a player to field both samurais/ninjas and best riflemen, like US marines. Castle sieges were disappointing, as the enemy is utterly ****. It can neither attack nor defend properly, and seeing AI try to climb the same tallest wall in my castle with 5 squads of 150 men at once is just too much. Overall, I don't see myself playing this for long, and it seems like a waste of 30$. A big step forward from the lackluster Shogun 2. FotS adds gunpowder era units into a Shogun setting and it works marvelously. There's nothing more satisfying than calling in your offshore ships to bombard and enemy in a castle and see them get absolutely destroyed, or setting up some Gatling guns before a wall of charging samurai and just watching as they get mowed down. I'm still not a fan of the setting. Japan is a still a very homogeneous country and none of the factions really felt any different from the others. The few interesting factions in the game were locked out and you have to buy a DLC to unlock them even though they are already in the game. FotS loses a point over that scam. Overall though, the game is an upgraded Napoleon and well worth the time of anyone who enjoyed that or Empire.. Utterly atrocious. Everything that was bad about S2 is worse in this. In battles you literally line up your men and watch them fire, you do absolutely nothing. The few battles that do happen (and they rarely do) are so utterly boring 90% of the time is spent sped up. Defense is even stronger now, provided they don't have artillery. But while artillery evens the playing field it makes the game no more interesting, as again you sit there and wait for your artillery to run out of ammo, or theirs. So if you like a game where you can line up your men and walk away, this is the game for you. Naval battle are much worse now, and considering that naval battles were so utterly atrocious in S2, that they could have managed to make is worse is a feat in and of itself. Where-as before though you could ignore that aspect of the game, now you have no choice as you're cities will get endlessly bombarded. The flee in circles mechanic is still there, where it you spend your entire time chasing navies that refuse to engage but just run away, during which time 10 other 1 stack units will blockade every port and trade route while bombarding your cities. If by sheer dumb luck you can actually engage an enemy navy, the naval battles are worse than the bumper-car cluster-fck that was S2 naval battles. As stupid as watching 20 ships sit there stuck and unable to move just firing ineffective arrows at each other for 20 min was, Fall of the Samurai's naval battles are even worse. The defender lines his boats up sideways and does nothing, while the attacker has no option but to steam head first into the fire losing almost his entire fleet before being able to fire a single shot. Unless you're MASSIVELY out numbered, you can't lose at naval defense. I got this on sale for 5$ and still feel ripped off.... I'd like to give this an 8.5 but I can't, so it'll be an 8. The good at Shogun II: Everything. The visuals, sounds, game mechanics, diplomacy, naval battles, everything is such a vast improvement over Medieval II TW(I didn't play Empire). The game as a whole is a glorious success in every aspect, but it does come with a few minor and two major flaws. The first major flaw is simple: it lags. Terribly. After checking around, this game has no multicore support. That means that the game's loading times, battles and world map all lag. It's a terrible, unforgivable issue that never stops. It will sometimes lag so bad it'll crash, that's how bad it is. Besides that, the balancing of units is a little poor: Artillery almost always ends up being the one and only thing you want to use, along with some support units to defend your cannons. While the mountainous landscape sort of kills that, it only sorts of does it. Most of the time, going for cannons is your best option for 90% of battles. Ironically, cannons become way less good against castles as the walls and hilltop fortresses are usually pretty decent at protecting from the ammo-limited cannons. Cavalry has become almost universally useless except in some extremely specific situations, too. That is certainly historically accurate, but it means that you're almost better off never making any cavalry. I may also be a massive pansy for saying this, but the other big flaw I found is that this game's very hard and legendary difficulties are just bollocks. They are absolutely ridiculous since you will find yourself, even if you play like a god, having to fight with 4-5 provinces against 30, since every single clan and their mother will attack you. I even had clans from literally the other side of the farthest island of Japan send out an amphibious assault specifically for me when they could attack literally anywhere else on the way! The AI doesn't get more difficult, it's just that the level of agressivity towards YOU specifically gets ****. Even your allies, or people who have every reason to attack you, will betray or assault you. As long as you hold yourself to normal or hard difficulties, this is pretty great though. The difficulty is just fine and the strategy, while usually pretty simple as Japan's shape does force you to fight clan after clan, you can't have many 3-way wars, you have to just push forward city after city till your victory, does allow for a lot of ambushes, surroundings, sieges, assaults of all kinds, naval supports, and such. Naval battles are a ton of fun, but are a bit on the easy side once you've learned the basic principle of ""get them in your range, don't get in their fire range"". I won many battles with 3 major ships against fleets of 10. One big problem with it is how huge the sea battlefields can be. You literally have to wait 5 full minutes of game time just to get in range! That is 2 real life minutes of waiting for nothing. And when it's a tough battle that you keep losing and have to reload to win, it's two minutes you'll really get annoyed at. This is actually another big problem, the loading times. They added this neat little quicksave feature before every battle. That's great and all, but if I lose a battle, the game automatically loads the world map to show me my defeat. I can't load a save from inside a battle. So I lose 10 seconds. Then I reload the quicksave. 10 more seconds. Then I can reload the battle. 10 more seconds! How about keep this feature but allow to just reload the battle once you've lost it? It's the same principle and it doesn't have to take that much time! Or better yet, just have the little battle menu show up if you choose to reload the battle so you can choose auto-battle or battle battle without any loading. With these problems out of the way, and apart from a few minor gameplay mechanics like the boarding and unloading of ships, trains and the like, this is an excellent title in every aspect. The upkeep of units is too high though, especially for artillery which should have very little as it only needs 30 men. Diplomacy works much better(although I'm never quite sure why my trade agreements are rejected and I find it a bit silly) than M2TW, the battles are extremely fun and varied although you'll often end up fighting in a forest or a hill, guns and cannons are the way to go to win battles apart maybe for castle battles, the technologies, agents and generals growth trees are an extremely great mechanic and this is an all-around wonderful TW game. I just wish CA had made an effort on the programming and actually had working multicore, this lag is awful. And that the difficulty wouldn't go from fighting a somewhat weak enemy to fighting 10 somewhat weak enemies at the same time. Oh and the cutscenes are very meh, too. Still truly a great, memorable, fun and complex game.. More shovelware from Creative Assembly. It's a copy and paste of Empire, but with only 1/10th of the units and all of the same bugs. Cannons are still completely invincible while limbered, pathfinding is still completely broken, and CA's games are still not worth wasting money on. If you want it, pirate it.. This is the best game i ever played and still playing it totally amazing love the rail way system and the new weapons /units for the choice thumbs up with a 10 10. This is a great addition to the Shogun series! This totally makes me stick to my laptop playing this for more than hundreds of hours!!! Really great soundtracks,animations,combat sequence,text,voice overs,arts,units and online.Great work on the clans units animations guns and facial expressions!!! LOVE THIS AND RECOMMEND TO ALL STRATEGY GAME PLAYERS!!!. Creative Assembly have done a great job in the areas of research and presentation. This game boasts great graphics, great maps, great units, great factions, and a decent sense of historical friction of Japan in a state of transition from medievel society to modernity. Sadly however the elements of game design are not so strong in the single player campaign. As in all CA games this game has an overly mechanical feel about it. War is a process of steady expansion, and it lacks any sense of narrative, identity politics, indeed any sense of politics, diplomacy or political economy. The game (on hardest setting) see saws from TOO HARD at the start to TOO EASY once your faction reaches the point of sufficient mass. Also lots of little things are unbalanced. Agents in particular are WAY OVERPOWERED. A single Geisha can convert all the generals in a rival faction to your army. A single Ninja can kill ever NPC in a faction and so on. This game was never truly play tested. For Multiplayer Fall of the Samurai was a great expansion. But the single player experience is, like all CA games, not very well designed. CA needs to get beyond mechanical expansion and into campaigns based on real diplomacy and real political economy. GROW UP CA! Learn something from Paradox Interactive!. Think Shogun and Empire Total War combined and you have it. A great improvement to the mechanics compared to Empire, however RESEARCH aspect of the entire Shogun series is dissatisfying compared to Empire. Also the Ishin ShiShi and the Shinsengumi played a much larger role in the Meiji Restoration having them act as in the manner of spies and assassins gives them great injustice. Definitely worth playing, for both newcomers and veterans, Shogun is the best series to date.. Look, unless you liked empire at war, you probably wont like fall of the samurai. But even then, why get fall of the samurai when you can just play empire? Empire is much more indepth and ecompasses more territory than japan. I strongly prefer Rise of the Samurai as mobilising Samurai armies is much more satisfying than musket-wielding noobs.. Great game excellent for all view perspectives, brilliant, epic and giant battles, Perfect graphics a serius game and nothing cant change that console reviews cant change the real score. I'll get out of the way the fact that I have no interest at all in this late, industrialized period of Japanese history, and move on to how much I still absolutely love this game. The technological advances not only add more units and building options, but actually create a wonderfully immersing backdrop for an already heady, atmospheric campaign. Choose to side with the Emperor or Shogun in a time of political and martial upheaval, and decide to try and maintain the traditional approach to warfare or embrace the new. The added units make ranged combat the order of the day, and with the addition of powerful artillery and naval support create a very engrossing battlefield experience. The campaign map is much bigger than Shogun 2, and looks more detailed with the railroads and surging industry of towns as they grow. The AI is good (although still able to be outwitted fairly easily) and for the most part it runs well without errors. Ignoring Sega's absolutely criminal approach to DLC (which does not affect the quality of the game in itself), I recommend it highly to strategy fans, irregardless of previous Total War experience.. Definitely enjoyable, a very good expansion to the original game. I personally enjoy the setting of a civil war situation in the campaign, and the choice between modernising and traditionalism, the latter, ironically being the more challenging play style. I did think, however, that because of the setting, unlike any other total war game i've played, you often get squeezed for choice of enemies since everyone fights either for the shogunate or for the emperor, narrowing your choice of enemies, conquests and your prospects of success. It doesn't quite seem like the domination-style gameplay of other total war campaigns, rather it feels co-operative and coalition-style. Particularly true in this instance is the idea that having more allies (which you inevitably will have) will not actually improve the game's progress, rather it seems that it hinders your progress and interest since you have less to fight and take over. I did, however, particularly like the modernisation system. I like the choice between becoming an advanced, europe-esque clan, and fighting against modernism across your campaign in an effort to remain traditional; I love the feel of the old japanese order colliding with the new. Then there's battles; Graphics don't have to be on highest settings to thoroughly enjoy this aspect. My fairly low-Spec PC runs Shogun 2 on low settings with an excellent performance and it doesn't look at all bad; i found this runs better than Napoleon TW on my PC Definitely worth the money , i'd say, i mark this highly for its in-depth coverage of the boshin war period and the conflict between old and new, and would mark this down purely because of the restriction of the number of opponents faced in campaign. Ultimately, excellent game.. I'm a little disappointed by the use of steam, while I love steam, this is not a game that belongs on steam. DLC is a cool thing in some cases but a blood pack for about 1.99USD? WUT? The other major thing that putting it on steam does is disallows the use of cheat codes. I loved cheating in Medieval total war 2. It was so much fun. Anyways enough of my ramblings, I suppose my major complaint with the game is that the use of steam ruins aspects of the game for me. However, more importantly this is still a total war game, through and through. I can lose hours and hours playing these games and this is no exception.. After having played nearly all of the Total war titles I got to say I don't care for these kind of total war games. I just don't like having guns in Total War at all Empire/Napoleon/FoTS. The Campaign is decent especially compared to the original Shogun 2 campaign. Also I noticed someone else said something about a Total War title of WW1 or WW2 which in my opinion is something I wouldn't buy for more than $10. (I would rate this lower, but this is more of my opinion of guns and the Total War series) I am also highly unsure whether the traditional style of playing Total War games (aka Troop Grouping/movement) would work well at all for anything passed the 1800s.. While a fun addition to the Totalwar series Fall of the samurai is missing key features like bayonets and a patch system to seperate the changes from the base shogun 2 **** game does not require shogun 2 but massively changes the graphics to shogun 2 anyways and removes loved graphical features such as gloss and breaking the view distance so users are plagued with faceless troops.Depth of field has also been bugged by this system along with many missing textures and other graphical errors like extreme color saturation and buggy shaders. The expansion seems to massively downgrade the graphics engine for the old shogun 2 users and as such without a way to stop steam from updating users have to put up with the changes to thier game even though it is not advertised nor is there any prior **** creative assembly team have reported that some of these errors apart from gloss would get looked at but so far after 2 months and many patches the only thing they fixed was the broken blood pack dlc which again was broken by fall of the **** they actively ignore patch requests and bug reports in favour of making money spinning faction DLC packs and map creators! This company seem to like to advertise thier games with features they like to remove later on and refuse to patch or correct so i do not see how i can give this title above a 4 rating which should of been an 8 if they would of corrected the errors and been more humble to what the consumer is sold and afterwards denied access too.. One of the best Total War title, further improving the graphics and gameplay of the series. The game is, perhaps, one of the best RTS games ever made even though I'm sure there will be many more TW games to take his place and raise the realism standard. Great multiplayer, superb single player!. Total War: Shogun 2 fall of the samurai, is a great game. the campaign is good, and the battles too... but the multiplayer campaign is broken; most of the time it crashes, and the load time is too long. but Total War: Shogun is still a good game. i recommend it.. One of the greatest expansions of the Total War series, in my opinion. It fixes a lot of the 'faults' of Shogun 2 with the two different unit-compositions (modern vs traditional), which makes the armies feel diverse and interesting. Also brings up a lot of new tactics if you want to be successful (especially with the modern armies). The navy aspect has gotten a new and improved aspect with the bombardment. This is great as it makes navies important as never before. The navy battles are also improved compared to Shogun 2, but that might just be the guns.. There are now multiple ways to win the game, as everybody does not turn on you in the end (if you choose to support the common cause), but you can also go the total war-style (war with everyone) if you like. The expansion supports (multiplayer)battles with the original Shogun 2 armies and that is also great fun. I think they have balanced the games pretty well against each other. The only complaint I have is the tendency of the modern units to bug when they shuffle into lines after getting shot. This makes the unit unable to fire in the meantime and while under fire, even more troops will die which equals to even more shuffling.. Oh well, still love this expansion and you should go buy and game it!. Excellent title that strikes a good balance between the modern ranged and melee-based units. Off-map naval artillery is my favourite new ability, and when the foreign marines rank up they become brutal killing machines with suppression and kneel fire enabled. Nice touch with the addition of rail networks to quickly transport troops along the length of Japan. Oh, and Shinsengumi are devastating: from assassinations to quelling dissent and provoking insurrections, truly they are most valuable agent!. Awesome game, best of the total war series. I didn't like the setting in the samurai era, but the game is still great. Only bad thing i've found is that now years are dived in many turns (due to the setting) and because of this it's difficult to have a long ""dinasty"" like in other total war games. The last bad thing is that on a high end pc WITHOUT a SSD the loadings screen takes long (better than Shogun 2 anyway). Great game, like a cross between WW1 and the American Civil War with added samurai. The multiplayer especially is worth mentioning for adding new avatars and a new avatar conquest campaign, as well as new unlockables.. Speaking as someone who only plays TW games in single-player, this is one of the best of the series and far better than the original Shogun2. Briefly, this is for the following reasons: * No realm divide issues: although there is a similar concept (where all shogunate and imperial han are forced into active conflict), they've gotten rid of Shogun 2's completely ahistorical and game-killing ""Colonization 2"" style AI dogpile. All the other side's han declare war on you, but they don't spawn huge armies instantly. * Less monotony: one obvious issue with all the Shogun titles, including the original, is the relative monotony of setting and unit types. Battles tend to be maximising your archers' window while the enemy closes, and then generic melee attrition. In comparison, although FotS is arguably not as good at distinguishing each faction as Shogun 2, with its clan-specific movies and big bonuses, you can now choose to build your armies with anything from spear ashigaru hordes to Empire Total War style line regiments complete with a light infantry skirmish line and carbine-equipped cavalry screen. With modern field guns and naval fire support thrown in - and the potential to be genuinely devastating - combat has a lot more depth than Shogun's slogging matches. * Better naval combat compared to Shogun 2: the AI is strangely worse on low levels, but it's a very cool take on a very neglected period (1850-1902 - the evolution of pre-Dreadnought battleships) of naval warfare, with centre-battery ironclads (l'ocean and Warrior), turret ironclads (Roanoak) steam paddle frigates, ironclad rams (Stonewall / Kotetsu) and torpedo boats all making an appearance. RBLs versus wooden hulls equals general devastation! * Tech tree and special units: modernisation effects on unrest, awesome tech and some great special units - especially the Shinsengumi / Ishin Shishi. Although each clan gets its own bonuses and sometimes their own units (e.g. Tosa get special rifleman unites), it is true that you're likely to end up with either a generic Shogunate or Imperial army rather than one dictated by specific clan bonuses - i.e. you will either have a samurai unit core or a line infantry core with modern artillery support in either case. So it's slightly more generic in that sense. However, this doesn't stop the player taking the game in a particular direction to suit the clan or just to see what happens. All in all, for me only a fully DLC'd copy of Empire beats this, and that's mostly for the greater scope of Empire.. This game will give you hundreds of hours of fun, complete one campaign then just start another one as another clan. Multi-player also lets you test your skills online and so far I have been in some epic battles, the tutorials on this game are also brilliant for beginners and the animations in the game out brilliant.. Apart from some stability issues (especially on HD 7xxx cards) and the bugged AA, it's a great add-on and definitely worth the money. For the low price it's a highly recommended buy.. The original one was awesome, this one is the best. It adds so much to the original game. I've played the original but this is an entirely new experience. Absolutely recommended. Go get it!!. fall of the samurai is for this price a great deal, especially the naval battles are great, love the new elements, just worth buying if u liked shogun 2!. It is difficult to overstate how pleased I am with this expansion. The shogun/emperor divide even at the start adds some much needed diversity in units. Bombardment from navies is a great addition. The only complaint I could have is the scope still only encompasses Japan, albeit with some new territories. If you've ever enjoyed a total war game, this will undoubtedly provide you with many hours of entertainment,. Dear Creative Assembly: I want to start by saying that the Total War series is the best strategy series that I'm aware exists. Shogun 2 and S2: Fall of the Samurai are really, really impressive. I'm especially happy with S2: FotS. The improvements are so that it ALMOST feels like a whole new game. I just have one request -not a complaint mind you, but a request: please stop re-releasing newer, better versions of old games. I absolutely loved Rome Total War, but please do not release a newer better version of it. Please keep it moving forward. Please make your next game about the fall of the old empires, i.e. World War 1. You could even set the technology to be turn-of-the-last-century at the beginning of a campaign mode, then have it developable (is that a word?) into WW1 tech, then maxing out at technology equal to what would've been available circa 1950. From bolt action rifles and bi-planes to early fighter jets and the atomic bomb. That. Would. Be. Awesome. And I can't imagine a scenario where I WOULDN'T be playing that game, job and wife be damned. I'm probably just kidding about that last bit.. One of the best total war games in fact expansion i have ever played. That modern era and the benefits that are coming from that era in terms of economy,warfare and weapons can glue you to your chairs for so many hours. Once again total war has managed to deliver an excellent game which is near perfect in terms of strategy, battles, graphics and sound. Recommended to die hard total war fans and even for new entrants.. Another fantastic addition to the series with every little bit changing the gameplay dramatically. Still offers many different effective strategies for every play style.. More annual shovelware from Creative Assembly. Full of bugs, low level of support from the appalling developers and no mod tools. No mod tools means no longevity. You will be bored of this game after 2 months but that is part of the plan so you buy their next dumbed down piece of crap which releases in about a years time. The only Total War games you need are Rome and Medieval 2. The rest are **** and the developers are morons. I hope and pray for the day when someone brings a decent Total War competitor. Either that or when Creative Assembly crashes and burns.. An excellent expansion.Diplomacy and Naval elements are much **** new,modern era is a good **** campaign map,though more realistic,is a major downfall for me. I really,really prefer the original.However,if you loved the original,you'll love this as much as I do.. Creative Assembly pulls it off a again with an awesome expansion. Yes there are some bugs and gattling guns are kinda of overpowered but with all the new units and the new way's to attack and move make this excellent. This also the most beautiful Strategy Game I have ever played from the unit details to the city battles. The railroad system is very nice as it's very expensive to make but almost invaluable once it is complete. offshore naval bombardment makes your navy extremely dangerous during sieges and can also pester troops. there are a lot of changes to many to list (like 80 unit battles). This is a must have for any total war fan scratch that any strategy fan.. Total War: Shogun 2 best strategy. DLC Total War: Shogun 2 - Fall of the Samurai very interested and new story me love. I play in Total War: Shogun 2 for 80 hours and i going play in Total War: Shogun 2 many many hours.. Fantastic game. Excellent value for money. Proper pc game","""Fall of the Samurai"" adds more advanced tactics to the vanilla Shogun 2 . the campaign map itself is very similar to the predecessor with its Japanese-cartoon-styled . the game is set in the mid 19th-century when the threat of western powers forced Japan's government to modernize ."
861.Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: Booster Course Pass - Wave 4,"great tracks the new course is amazing and Birdo was a welcome bonus.. I'll give this DLC an 88%. All DLC Wave 4 tracks are great! You can't go wrong with the classic DK Summit from Mario Kart Wii. It's nice to see Riverside Park return to Mario Kart: Super Circuit. Yoshi's Island is a very creative race track to race on. Amsterdam Drift has great music and so does Waluigi Stadium.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Nice DLC, nice to go back to those nostalgic tracks with some modern twists.. horrible just horrible don't buy really bad and not needed for the game its a case of Nintendo wanting your money. This is just a DLC, not a full-blown game. It doesn't need to be ranked this highly up on the list.. Best wave yet, I can’t wait for wave 5 and 6. My favourite course in this wave has to be Yoshi’s Island.. This doesn't belong in the ""racing game"" category, it's just a DLC ffs. This can't be better than a full game lol.. Stupid game for little kids, I don't know why so many people play this boring and repetitive ****. I like how well detailed it is even though they have put circuits of the Mario kart tour it is quite handsome to have a good time. This is awesome compared to the last 3 waves. Wave 1 was rather mediocre, Wave 2 was alright, Wave 3 was pretty good, but this a step up compared to those. Only criticism is how they picked DS Mario Circuit over DS Airship Fortress. Still a good track though.","this is just a DLC, not a full-blown game . it doesn't belong in the ""racing game"" category, it's just a DLC ffs . my favourite course in this wave has to be Yoshi's Island ."
862.Kirby: Canvas Curse,"If Canvas Curse released at any other time other than the launch window for the DS, I doubt it would be looked at as a good game. Its fairly average, and makes a simple task of getting from point A to point B into a bit of annoying one using unusual means of guiding Kirby through the level. It certainly isn't as bad as I make it out to be, but it really doesn't deliver much to the Kirby series aside from having a fairly large amount of content and good soundtrack. Overall Canvas Curse is a product of its time than anything else.. AKA Kirby and the Rainbow Paintbrush, this touchscreen-based puzzle game sees you guiding the lovable blob through traps and enemy infested levels in a similar but better way to Yoshi's Touch & Go thanks to more variety and powerups.. Gameplay is unique, especially for the era. It's quite fun once you get a handle on it and can pull off more advanced maneuvers. Underwater sections are sometimes vexing but a welcomed change of pace for such a short game. The end-game difficulty ramps up oddly fast with spikes galore and narrow passages to navigate but the challenge is nice for a change. Backgrounds are an artistic hodgepodge and occasionally a tad gaudy but it fits the theme and certainly is distinct. The music is surprisingly underwhelming for a Kirby game. Other than the final boss, every boss deviates from typical gameplay with more of a minigame-type offering. I would've liked more boss fights using the magical brush. There are lots of reasons to return after beating the game including other minigames, time trials, and collecting all the in-game medals.. Really interesting and beautiful (by the 2005 DS game standards) game. It can get really frustrating from time to time and it doesn't have the best level design but the controls are fun and the sub-modes are really good.. Looks cute, makes a good use of the system. I just didn't liked the way it plays, often times I'm just flinging Kirby around without coordination because it goes too fast and I can make it go where I want it.. A flawed but enjoyable touch-based Kirby spin-off title. I find the core gameplay to be somewhat unwieldy, especially when compared with the spiritual sequel to this game, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse. I didn't ever feel quite comfortable controlling Kirby in Canvas Curse, which isn't something I experience in Rainbow Curse. Abilities are present, and do offer novelty to the experience, but their use tends to be very situational. The visuals and audio are quite nice, the paint theming is effective much of the time. Canvas Curse does reuse a few too many elements from previous titles, specifically enemy sprites and music. The game's soundtrack consists almost entirely of remixes of previous songs from the series, and those these are all well done, they do make the game feel as though it has less of it's own identity. Kirby: Canvas Curse is not one of my preferred Kirby spin-off games, but it still offers a quality experience, and though flawed is still worthwhile.. Very Unique Canvas Curse does it's own thing with a very interesting concept.. Game: Kirby Canvas Curse Genre: Adventure Platformer/Touchscreen Developer: HAL Publisher: Nintendo System: Nintendo DS (DS) Year of Release: 2005 Length of Playthrough: 5 Hours Total Score: 71/100 Value Score: 7.1/10 • Story: 5/10 • Characters: 7/10 • GamePlay: 7/10 • Graphics: 8/10 • Sound: 9/10 • Music: 9/10 • Length: 4/10 • Replay Value: 7/10 • Player Value: 5/10 Pros +Unique gameplay style using touchscreen controls with no need for the face buttons +22 levels across 8 worlds/areas +Boss battles play like mini games +Play as additional of 4 characters alongside Kirby (must unlock them) Cons -Game's difficulty is too easy in the beginning but difficulty spike increases last two worlds -There are only 4 boss battles (three of which are repeats) -Touchscreen controls are not responsive all the time and causes frustration at times -Very Short. This game is great with it's unique plot and great gameplay. This is great but still can be flawed at some points. I highly recommend this amazing fun game!. By 10 I mean 9.50... Well, canvas curse is everything you want: fun and graphics, right? Yes, but the game play is hard and the game is punishingly difficult!! If you wan't to go hardcore, you can play as other characters, who have less health... They made it even harder!! God!. Not a Good Kirby Game. It is not the same as any other it is not a platformer. The game to me just is not that great. its not the worst kirby game. but its not the best.. Loved Mass Attack, so I thought I'd pick up a used copy of this one for another fun, stylus driven Kirby game. But Mass Attack it is not. Kirby feels clunky to control; I'm constantly scribbling underneath him just to get him to go the right way or actually do what I want. Frequently I try to use his powers and end up getting hit or dying. The game also feels very...small. There's no world map, very few unlockables. The music is good as always and it still looks bright and cheerful like a Kirby game should, but it's way more frustrating than fun.. this game is awesome ! I got it and beat it and I had so much fun !!!!! it is awesome !!!!!!!!!! so it is given a perfect ................ 9/10.....","aKA Kirby and the Rainbow Paintbrush, this touchscreen-based puzzle game sees you guiding the lovable blob through traps and enemy infested levels . the end-game difficulty ramps up oddly fast with spikes galore and narrow passages to navigate . the music is surprisingly underwhelming for a Kirby game ."
863.Burnout Legends,"Burnout legends is probably the best arcade racing game for the PSP, the game is beautiful, the gameplay is very enjoyable, the physics are great for a PSP game, the challenges are cool and of course great music. The devs really made this game with care, IT'S SO WORTH PLAYING. All burnouts mixed for the portable consoles. Enough said.. is quite short though. Essentially a greatest hits style compilation of elements from the previous Burnout games, it's not quite as good as Dominator but still has plenty of nitrous burning, traffic dodging thrills and spills.. i finished this game so many times i dont remember, good gamepley and graphics for the psp, one of the best car games for the psp. perfect burnout for the psp.. I love this game Burnout is so good game Graphics and music and gameplay is perfect. Burnout Legends is my first Burnout game i played, and contrary to games like Ratchet And Clank and Jak And Daxter on the PSP that, while they may be inferior to the PS2 trilogy at the end of the day, when I played them for the first time I really wanted to know what the originals were like. Unfortunately with Burnout Legends this is not the case. It reminds me of a recent game that becomes one of my most dissapointed games: NFS MW 2012, although not as bad thankfully. For starting this is a racing game with crashing physics, but i would tell you even the Java Asphalt games had much better physics and handling than this: The controls are clunky, the drifting is all over the place, the crash cam is annoying and due to the pixelation is hard to see traffic cars at the distance, the hit detection to count a hit as a takedown is inconsistent and the game ends up being repetitive. Did i also mention terrible rubberbanding? Ugh.... This proves how EA doesnt know how to make racing games on portable hardware (maybe except Carbon Own The City). I also dont like it how the collectors cars arent all unlockable by normal means and that some special takedowns are pretty obscure or hard to do, making 100% completion a bit of a mess. At least the graphics are impressive for the PSP and the sense of speed is incredible. I also like the zoom type of effect when doing takedowns and i have to admit, the game is a bit addicting and the amount of cars and tracks is pretty respectable so is a decent game to kill some time but nothing more.. THE BEST BURNOUT GAME ON PSP! I LOVE THE BURNOUT SERIES! THE BURNOUT REVENGE AND TAKEDOWN ARE MY FAVORITE ONES 9.7/10. For its time it was a decent Burnout Greatest Hits package. But today, with Burnout Revenge and Burnout Dominator existing it feels dated. Since we got a remaster for Burnout Paradise, heres hoping the rest of the Burnout franchise gets remastered and we get a remake of this great game in a true complete trilogy form.. Pretty much Burnout 3 on the PSP. That being said, its one of the best racing games for the system. Amazing graphics, fun gameplay and cool tracks and cars . The difficulty is well balanced. The game is challenging without getting in your way too much. The game holds up. Its still a lot of fun after all these years. Highly recommended.. Burnout Legends and Paradise are the best games on Burnout Series . In Burnout Legends not really good physics , but better than in Burnout Dominator and in Burnout Legends rate higher than in other Burnout Games and this game is funniest Burnout in series , but Burnout Paradise does not matter better than Burnout Legends and in Burnout Legends graphics as in Burnout Dominator , but Burnout Dominator implemented in 2007 and Burnout Legends in 2005 . Burnout Legends is very good racing game . 8/10 .. This review is almost a decade late, but then again, here it is. Before this, I had NEVER played a Burnout game ever. Maybe this was not the best game to start with, but at least it was not the worst. Burnout Legends is a game where you are a driver. However, it has to be one of the most original games ever. Tired of having somebody cut in front of you and you can't do anything? Simple, SMASH THEM INTO A WALL!! There are a few modes, including Races, Road Rage, Crash, Pursuit, and much more. Racing is what it sounds like, except you can crash cars into walls and get boosts by doing so. In my opinion, this is one of the worst modes in the game because of one problem, the controls. Maybe it is the game or my PSP system, but this game can be either very sensitive or have no sensitivity at all. It can easily get frustrating when you are trying to not get in last place or get all of the gold medals. Road Rage is a mode where you have one goal, which is to crash as many other cars at possible before you crash multiple times or in a time limit. This is one of the most over the top and fun modes in the game. Next we have Crash, which is not only my favorite, but a fan favorite as well. What is your goal? To cause as much destruction as possible. The more destruction, the more cash you get, which unlocks cars for the mode. The last mode I am going to talk about is Pursuit, which once again, is one of my least favorite modes. Your goal is to take down A SINGLE CAR. That is it. However, the car has a lot more health than the other cars in different modes do. Despite me loving this game, there are a few cons. For example, every time you crash a car, it goes into slow motion and focuses on that car. What is the problem with that? I love that in Sniper Elite 2 and 3. But there, it is not a fast paced game, unlike here. There are SO many time where that happens and I crash because of it. It gets extremely frustrating and was something that ruined the game a bit for me. Another con is that the controls feel insensitive most of the time, even when using the D-Pad. My final complaint is the graphics, but not for the reason you would think. It is not because they look bad, in fact, they look very good for the PSP, but the textures make it hard to see what is a ramp and what isn't. Many times I crash into a ramp thinking it is a road, making it frustrating. I would give this game a 8.6, but you can only do whole numbers. This game is a must own for anybody who likes Burnout games or racing games in general. Even if not, I recommend at least trying it.. If you love Burnout, then this game is a no-brainer. It's like an expansion pack for Burnout 3. And it has many of the tracks from previous games. Again if you love Burnout, then you know what to expect. I wish this was, however, released on the PS2 so I can see the detailed destruction of vehicles. Still, buy this game from PSN if you have a PSP or Vita.. Best racing game with MotorStorm in PSP. The crash mode is fantastic. You never get bored with this mode. Race mode is very good too but crash mode is better for sure.. Overal the game is good and interesting. But number of laps per race is always 3 which is a bit too long, since the lenght of a track is pretty decent.. Great visceral racer, almost as good as the best Burnouts on home consoles. Sweet graphics, proper soundtrack and sounds, very good production values. Might be a little short (5-7 hours to beat all World Tour levels), and I found the Crash mode to be a little lacking (long loading times, somewhat lacking in physics and graphical details compared to 'big' Burnouts), though you can easily spend some more time getting all gold in World Tour. Highly recommended!","burnout legends is probably the best arcade racing game for the PSP . the game is beautiful, the gameplay is very enjoyable and the challenges are cool . the controls are clunky, the drifting is all over the place and the crash cam is annoying ."
864.Minds Beneath Us,"Combined Taiwan Cyberpunk Dystopia world setting, absolute amazing character cast and dialog writing, stunning visuals and handrawing giving a sense of unnecessity, just right music, and most importantly deep story touching told through all the decision-driven dialog. This game should be included in a list of best explained Cyberpunk and became one of my favourite story-driven indie game in years together with VA-11-Hall-A.Main flaws I can feel however, is the story went to fast in the last chapter and it feels somehow incomplete.. This game captivated me from start to finish with its compelling story, well-developed characters, and engaging dialogues. I was never bored and constantly eager to discover what would happen next. I sincerely hope a sequel is in the works.. The game has a stunning start and the gameplay is really immersive. The art is outstanding and the music is fine. However, many issues become more apparent during gameplay. Many side quests have unfinished stories, and some gameplay mechanics gradually disappear as the game progresses. The developer has mentioned plans for a sequel, but there are still too many gaps in this game's story, leaving players with insufficient clues to piece things together. In conclusion, the game's pros and cons are pretty clear, but it is still a good work worth trying.. Easily the best game I've played recently. The story is absolutely great and easily the highlight of the game, and even though the game only consists of walking, dialogue options and some qte's, I wasn't bored for a single second. Choices matter, the game design is beautiful and the characters are realteable. The price is absolutely fair for the length of the game. Would absolutely recommend.. Amazing piece. It's a rich story with a lot of characters in 5days. Not a blast ending but still good in its own way.","the story is absolutely great and easily the highlight of the game, and even though the game only consists of walking, dialogue options and some qte's, i wasn't bored for a single second . the price is absolutely fair for the length of the game ."
865.Football Manager 2013,"Football manager barely changes anything and republishes their game for full price. Greedy cheap basterds. The game database is great, but if you play for long enough and understand the mechanics the game becomes easy to beat, because it requires little adaption to the opponent and the scouting system is easy to game. There is also always some game breaking problem, such as crossings working insanely well.. In-dept game but not so bad like new ones. It doesn't want you to be perfect like real manager. But still, there should be difficulty setting or something like that to make it a better game. Little bit slow engine.. I've been playing Championship Manager since CM2. I remember waiting sometimes an hour for the new season to run / update on my Win 3.1 PC. I've played various versions since up till FM2013. It's a few years late I appreciate to be reviewing this, but I have recently redownloaded this from stream onto my work laptop and playing on my commute to and from work. I can't put my finger on when, but I've become severely addicted to FM13. It's Football manager. I dont assume many people will be reading this review (at all) and any that do will already know that FM games are in affect a database you play. FM13 is incredibly smooth going on my i7. I'm not much of a football fan anymore. There was a time I would get the pre-season over-view and edit the leagues and players to what teams they moved to, some 30-40hrs of using the editor. I don't bother anymore, if someone starts at their previous team, who cares. The engine works and works well, I'm currently 10 years into a career into my latest game and all the known stars of today are just old record holders and coaches now, so who cares. I'm giving this a 8 in the hope that others see this and think ""I could down load FM2013 for pretty much free, compared to £30+ for the latest version, and I'm gunna get much the same experience"" Do it. Be cheap and cheerful - this is a classic version, very playable and while it can frustrate the hell out of me when my top scorer happens to get a training injury 2 days before a huge match, that is life, sods law rules and its still as satisfying being an underdog and taking the bigger teams to town.. This game is bad!!!Ive played the series since FM08, so i know how this game SHOULD work!Ive played FM2012 for years now and bought FM2013 and 2014 when they come out.FM2013 was so bad back than, i didnt played enough back than to review this **** .No FM2012 got some bugs cause it runs since it came **** fought i give DM2013 a retry with the newest patch and 2014 isnt an option cause it **** **** 2012 was the best football related manager ever created in my **** matchengine was a bit flawed here and there but all in all you could play with your own strategy and only the players you got are the limiting **** FM2013 the matchengine or the AI are the limiting **** players are unable to pass the ball around properly.Even the best players on this planet will screw up constantly.There are some improvements to 2012, **** player can shield and stop the ball **** 2012 many ball where just cleared with a longshot to the center or your defenders produced throw-ins for you opponent.This is mostly gone.Instead SI screwed up EVERYTHING **** passing is bad as i stated **** crosses are soooo bad, the fly mostly out of the **** too much in the match is just random.There is no steady stream of passing, nearly no great **** boils down to overpowered winger and strangely goalkeepers.Sometimes a no-name GK will save EVERYTHING, even the hardest and best placed **** suddenly, he screws up when one of the bad crosses hits its **** your defenders are too passive when they play against a dribbler.Dribbler, they were too strong in 2014, now i see where this comes **** played a halfe season in england and most of my goals where scorred by my wingers with **** most goals were not earned.I lost my best games 4:0 and won my worst games with 3 goals.This is random, sorry.Like i said, im not new to the series, im no **** won countless titles in every FM since **** here?It never feels **** win undeserved, this **** lose undeserved, that **** is part of real football, no question, but not like this and not constantly.Dont buy this game.Dont buy FM2014, its even **** pls, dont preorder **** says **** you"" to the consume since 2 **** company.. Brilliant simply Brilliant... This game may have been the single reason that i failed my GCSE Business studies. I took me a good 8 months to get bored with this game. this game had me fall inlove with the franchise and i look back at it as the most addictive game i have ever played.. By far the worst game by the FM series. don't recommend anyone to buy this. Horrible match engine! The training is also completely garbage in the same level of AI. Hope they realize this, I really don't understand a lot of the reviews of people talking good about this game. Not even deserve one star.. Having the previous Football Manager I find that it's really unnecessary to buy newer version since the changes are so minor and unnoticeable. However I still think that it's a great game, and if you lack a FM game then it's a good bet to buy it because of it's unbelievable complexity and strategy.. The best manager I've ever played a game. I can only write about good things that are good for innovation. Classes can bind to the machine off. I look forward to the next part.. This has to be the game with the longest and steepest learning curve I have ever played. Even now halfway through the Dutch competition season I am searching online every day to fix problems with my team and my own performance as a manager. Whenever I think I have all the problems solved, another crisis appears on the horizon for which I need to find an answer to. But despite of making managing a daunting job, I find myself addicted to running game after game, increasing the capabilities of my team and getting results.. great upgrades in comparison with FM12 nice gameplay excellent 3D match engine transfers are more realistic .I saw some really infair critics that they ruin FM13 metascore.... dont buy it if you dont know how to play people. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I usually buy the newest Football Manager every year. This year it as always is better than the previous one AI is much better. Good 3D match. Really better than 2012.. This is not as easy as previous parts,here we've got huge problems with the tactics. Even playing RM or PSG,MC it will be difficult to achieve your goals without primary tactic I used to play for Fiorentina,every single season I had to add something new in formation or i change the tactic at all. And FINANCE. Is that corruption in that game?money always waste from my budget(no debts,no transfer points). And it wasn't only Fiorentina's career But still it is a good game,I am a fan of it from FM 08, each year it gets more and more difficult.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Save your money. The match engine is bogus and its like playing a random number generator. Anything you do really doesn't seem to make a difference. Wait for 1-2 years until they fix the match engine.. Terrible Match Engine. Prone of Mistakes is Unforgiven, Horrible. FM12 is Better than this. Where's the detailed of training schedule? Where's the Match Engine in FM12?. It's just not football... and that's the problem really. While there's no doubting the addictive quality of FM does that mean a good game? Not really and while the game is packed with content, gameplay wise it's very poor. If you're a serious football fan you'll find the tactical system terribly disappointing. You have a very basic tactics board one shape, for attacking and defending and then a bunch of numberless sliders that are supposed to represent tactical instructions, hardly realistic or intuitive. The mentality slider, for example, (easily the most important) governs a players positioning on the pitch, on attack and defense but also affects how he passes the ball. As you might imagine it's almost impossible to recreate realistic tactics and anyone who knows a bit about football and the various systems that influence the game will feel horribly let down. The developers have been pushing the same old engine and system each year, adding enough gloss to pass as ""user friendly features"" so unsurprisingly the gameplay never seems to improve. The game's training system is equally as ludricous, drag yet more sliders up and down to apparently represent a professional club's training regime. The game is a bit of a joke to be honest but it has a rabid and zealous fanbase who put lots of hours into providing free content which is really well made and they're all completely addicted which may explain why the game gets generally favourable reviews from the media but they're not to be trusted. I know football and I've played this game in-depth. Please don't waste your money. It's a shame really but unfortunately there just isn't a decent football management sim out there. If there were developers out there ambitious enough to have a go they could easily knock SI games off their perch but they should at the very least study football, see how the tactics and training methods work and then try to recreate that in a simple, fun manner something S.I. games fail miserably at.. Who ever reads this you have to understand two things about me. 1: I have spent, many many many meticulous hours on this game and all of the other football managers. In fact clocking up 1000's of hours on each FM series. 2: I am a qualified football coach, with a FA coaching level 2. From what experience I have managing football, I have to say that this game is the closest thing you'll get to managing a team. Yes, there are a few things that need slightly improving but I believe that this game is the closest footballing experience you can ever possibly have without doing the real thing. The game is absolutely endless, the vastness and depth that they add to every year is beyond anything I've ever seen in gaming or indeed simulation. The game wont win awards for graphics or sound or game play, but it will win awards for being an absolutely incredible experience. Play this game, no matter who you are your interest and knowledge of football will increase because of it and you'll see football in general in a different light. You just know that this series will keep getting better and better. 10/10 from me.. football manager 2013 is awesome the best yet dont now what people are hating on this game for wake up if u dont like dont play it simples it piss me of when people slag **** ill like to see u do better. I don't know how people are giving positive feedbacks for this game. FM2013 is the worst FM series that's been out so far. I have been playing this game since 2009 and i cant believe they messed up so hard this year. 3D engine looks like players are playing soccer on ice. 2012 was soooooo good and how can you guys ruin like this??? Don't purchase this piece of and stick with your FM2012 or wait for FM2014. Additionaly, FM2012 is the best.. prefer Fm 2012 fm 2013 * LOw Quality of game(during the game the player working like in NCL very POOr! * irreal velocity * good for training * booring for the irreal price the conclusion is if that fm 2012 is a game of 5 stars fm 2013 is a game of 2 is not good for the price of this year please working hard for the next! veramente una delusione .....vedere pattinare sul ghiaccio i giocatori e' irritante...come tutta la grafica.. Rubbish game don't really get to do much on it except manage what players and subs and transfers and that is about it. There is not really any other features and the layout is not very good. I would reccomend fifa manager 13. Been playing FM-series for many years now, but this is just horrible. I'm paying players millions a year, but they're making mistakes I can see junior players never make. The mistakes made by the players are so horrible that I've been pulling out half of my hair, and I'm only halfway through my second season! The game just seem broken and half done. Refund please.. This game has been a disappointing mess from day one. From it's initial release as a beta masquerading as finished product to the recent update which just broke more things. One shouldn't have to buy unfinished products, and be forced to wait to have it patched into playability, only to have the broken parts of the code shifted to a new place with every patch. THIS GAME IS BROKEN. DO NOT BUY IT.. Very complex, yet very addictive single player. You can manage in almost every league on the world, from Premiership to Sudan Premier League. Find best youngsters and develop them to make them successors of current generation. Prepare to be mad a lot when your top striker will get injured on training, or you'll lose a goal in 94th minute of playoff game, but be overjoyed when it'll be your team scoring winner in stoppage time, or when you'll be drawn to weakest group in Champions League. Multiplayer adds way more emotions when human players play against each other.. This game humbled me. The sheer depth to this game is truly remarkable. From managing a league down to choosing which foot a player should use or not use. Seriously. The devs managed to capture every single aspect to managing a football team. Yet, the actual matches are fast and fun and aren't burdened by all the management details. Just an all-around fun game. If you have any interest in football or want to learn plus have fun, this is your game.. Graphics a little juvenile but seems ok. I didn't like that you can buy cheats. This cheapened the game. It also bothered me with the level the game developer goes to ""get in"" to my computer to display stats of the battery and processor usage and posts it on the game display. I thought this was unnecessary and redundant, since my PC already provides this information. I think its arrogant and I prefer you STAY OUT OF MY COMPUTER!! Getting started just to ""look under the hood"" requires an hour of game setup and way too tedious. Not the best ""Soccer"" version.. Really better than 2012, The gameplay is way more modern and it fills the gap that led the predecessors to unconsistency. I really liked all the new features of the game, that to me give a really better managing experience.. I blew 232 hours on this bad boy after about a month and a half. If I can spend that much time absorbed in a game, it has to be top quality, it is. One thing, you need to go to various fan sites to download decent skins, logos, faces, and various misc stuff to make it look good. Out of the box, it's not ready.. Wow, the match engine feels terrible, really really bad. I'm pretty sure the last game wasn't like this. The matches now just doesn't feel real anymore, the AI seems to have taken a turn for the dumb. No more marking (or 5 players all running towards the ball, leaving everyone else open), if someone over runs a ball they don't seem to tackle, everyone shooting from miles away, crazy!. I am so disappointed with this last version. Classic mode?!? Yes I was looking for it. I am playing this game and the predecessors at least since 2001 now I think, and clearly I have no more time to spend sleepless nights on it. So I bought it just to try the classic mode and see if I still can have fun with this game spending considerably less time on it. As I tried the FMH 2012 and it was a positive try, I was really motivated with this one, but here the classic mode in FM 2013 ****... Simply cannot go anywhere and cannot do or achieve anything, and if you want to do so, you have to pay for some cheats. What the... FM is becoming a World of FM... I think this was my last FM.. Just a terrible training mode ruining the possibility of developing your players in a away you want to do it. Match in 3D view looks only a bit better than in FM 2012 but...poor match engine is the second and probably the biggest weakness of this edition, even if they will fix it completely in 999 patch i still won't play it because of messed up training. I bought few weeks ago and i've already sold it for 70% of it price, still a very good deal for anyone who paid SI full price for FM2013 :]. I don't see how anyone who really loves football can give this anything less than a 10. The hours I've spent on this are countless and I still go back for more. Sure it has the occasional annoying AI issues but you can overlook that...sometimes players in RL do stupid things too. The UI Is not as good I'll say that much but with skins being made for it by users you can tweak the game and its database giving it more of a person touch. Stupidly addictive and a lot of fun.. Not really enough improvement over FM2012 for the money. I do not think I got my money's worth paying this much for the same game with a new face and new bugs, and some of the same old bugs as well. It doesn't play smoothly or feel like much fun. If it were a new game, its OK, but since I already had FM2012, I felt a bit cheated.. Well were to start, always been a big fan of FM but this years there are problems. Im just not enjoying as much as I thought I would of, I bought the game for not only single player but to play online with friends, Online mode is really buggy and slow when you play matches but its fine when your host. Now I done research on this and its happening to a lot of people where you play a game online and it takes around 10mins to complete a match and that's on full speed commentary only, So for me that's 1 thing that's messed it up for me because I was really looking forward to starting a league but really impossible due to the length of the games, it needs to be sorted out. FM2013 is still the best Football Management Sim out there but for me personally having played the series since the very first Championship Manager all those years ago I just dont get the same buzz playing it anymore. I think those specifically looking for the features in the game this genre offers will love it but those on the fence will get bored with it.. This game could be fun, if they combined efforts with the ""Train Simulator"" crew so that I could derail my train and smash it through the wall of the football stadium, killing the thick-headed footballers and their fans alike.. Game is the dullest in the series, you now NEED to conduct press conferences, team talks and individual player talks to succeed, this involves clicking and reading the same things over & over & over & over....... Flawed match engine and generally boring game;From a FM fan since CM93. The game is broken, and you can pay to cheat. Football Manager is dead.. I didn't play the full game, only played the demo and think that was a good decision. I was really anxious to see the improvements SI had promised because FM 2012 needed some. When I saw it at Steam with a not so cheap price, still wanted to buy it because it's my favourite game. And as a fan, I'm deeply disappointed to see: - The match engine became even worse; - The ""improvements"" in the graphics field, only caused some features to disappear and others to be hidden in places you take hours to find; - The AI teams continue to be favourites for any transfer, regardless if you play with Barcelona or a Brazilian Fourth Division team. Doesn't matter the salary or budgets paid, in 90% of the transfers the AI challenges you, they'll win. - During the matches, the same problems with FM 2012 continue to make us want to give up of the series. Your players almost NEVER get a shoot on target, even with players having full attributes. While the AI teams with players having awful attributes, make one goal with every shoot form distance, regardless who is your keeper. Resuming: I won't pay that much to play the same FM 2012 with a new decoration. If you're a fan and still didn't play it, don't buy the game,try the demo and see by yourself if you want to pay to play that thing. Sorry for my English, I did my better.. Always been a fan of Football Manager and I do like the extra additions to the latest version, but the 600 extra features is more of a marketing gimmick than anything. They have added a horrible 2.0 overlay to the game which is absolutely horrible, and makes the game stutter running it with the steam overlay as well. The game itself is fun to play and would still recommend it, but what a stupid idea by putting that new overlay on it's annoying.. I have been a fan of the Football Manager series ever since the days of Championship Manager. I have never had any problems with it and have always invested alot of time into each game. This time however it simply feels broken, too many goals at the near post, too many goals from long shots, poor goalkeepers, invincible wingers all of this adds up to an unenjoyable experience. When your on the right side of a 4-0 drubbing with 4 goals all beating a top keeper at the near post it feels hollow, when your on the wrong side you could launch your laptop through a wall. Not an experience you want from a game, FM2012 was far better than this, it may change with patches etc..i'll put the game on in a few months to check, until then a waste of money.. After a long time playing F.I.F.A. and PES i found the most good Football game that ever be made. This Game has everything you want as an Football Fan. I give it an 10 ^_^. I didn't mind paying for the game early and expecting a few bugs during the beta, but I now feel I have paid for a product that falls way short of what it claims. The games are all very similar and they actually get extremely tedious to watch due to the poorly executed new 3D match engine. I think it's a big let down on previous years and SI must be very careful if they don't want to lose customers in future. I feel the match engine wasn't tested nearly enough before beta release. If it had been looked at by any football fan in depth, these errors and bugs would have been ironed out before any of us even had to witness them. I'm a loyal FM player and have been for years, and I really want to enjoy the game - but right now, unfortunately, it's way off the mark. I would advise anyone considering buying it to wait until at least a few patches have come out that address the poor match engine, because right now it's just too frustrating to enjoy. SI Games have committed a professional foul this year and not even been booked.. Really not as good one as their earlier games according to me. I think- as many other reviewers- that the game is really not a classic anymore. And I really do hate the idea of different ""perks"" to get around in the game.. This game is not quite a classic, but it's competently done. I feel the AI has taken a small stepbackwards compared to the previous version, but other facets of the game have been executed competently.. Great game with a better simulation. Great interface, large database. There new mode: Classic mode is terrific. I lost track in spending so much time in maintaining the team, therefore I was hesitating to buy FM2013.. I bought this game wondering how they could improve an already stellar experience, but they managed it. The AI of the players when watching the 3D match engine for me is the best improvment. It really feels like a proper game of football. Adding the FM Classic mode, whilst I prefer the standard game, is a nice addition to the series. Not everyone has the time or patience to play the full game, so a scaled down version will suit a lot of people. I would like to add aswell that the ""micro transactions"" only apply to this mode. People moaning about this need to realise that the main game is NOT affected by this addition. I personally don't see this an an issue, it's not hard to find a downloadable data editor which many people use anyway so if people want to cheat, then they will. Micro transactions are the future of gaming whether we like them or not, so it doesn't surprise or bother me that they're included. The simple thing to do if you don't like the idea of paying them **** to pay them. Simple.",football manager barely changes anything and republishes their game for full price . if you play for long enough and understand the mechanics the game becomes easy to beat . i've been playing championship manager since CM2 .
866.Out of the Park Baseball 14,"Played 2 minutes into what i thought would be a decent game. turned into clicking random ass buttons on the terrible HUD trying to figure out what the **** Im supposed to be doing. Who the **** thought it was a good idea to make a ****ing Base-Ball team Management Simulator. This **** needs to be burned. Anyone who got past the 5 minute mark of this game has my condolences.. If you are seriously bored enough to manage a baseball team then you can play this terrible piece of **** I can't believe this series even started who the hell thought a baseball management sim would be fun! btw it takes forever to load even though it has nothing special to load. overall 0/10 do not get this hunk of crap.. The best sports simulation game on the market today. If you want to be a GM or on-field manager, this is the game for you. This isn't a game like MLB: The Show where you will actually be playing the game as a player, it is strictly a management sim. However, if this is your type of game, it is absolutely the best at what it does. You can play any historical season starting from 1871, and you can essentially build a new history of baseball. You can also add any number of other leagues (Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan, for example) and play fictional or current modern day leagues as well. The databases used bring almost every single player who has ever appeared in the major leagues, and you can get other user-done databases that will bring in Negro Leaguers, old Pacific Coast Leaguers, and so many more to the table. If you are any kind of a fan of the history of baseball, or just love to manage baseball, this is the game for you. The mod community allows you to get pretty much any team logo, uniforms, and photos and what they call FaceGen's for pretty much any player who has ever played. Don't pay any attention to some of the troll reviews. It isn't an on-the-field game, but it doesn't need to be. Any baseball nut is missing out if they don't play this game, and they've been making new versions for well over a decade now. Great support AND community!. If you enjoy Baseball and like a cerebral management game as opposed to an arcade type game, there is no better game than OOTP and version 14 is the best of the series. It takes a bit of investment but that little investment pays many dividends. I have probably got more of my moneys worth out of this game than any other I **** sports games are not my favorite genre!. If you are a die-hard fan who has been following baseball his whole life -- this game will change your life. It is that good. Without exaggeration, one of the most absorbing, constantly surprising, absurdly fun games I have played in any genre. Although not for the faint-hearted -- it certainly requires some patience and manual / forum reading to learn. But once you get a sense of the sheer scope and flexibility of what you can do, you will be hooked, and astounded. Want to manage your favorite 'real life' MLB team? Or do you just want to GM? Or manage your favorite MLB team with entirely fictional players? Or do you want to manage in Double-A ball? Or create an entirely fictional league? Or manage the 1973 Mets? Or have independent North American, Japanese, Taiwanese, Venezuelan major leagues, where free agents can move from one league to the next? Or have high school feeder teams that provide prospects for your drafts? Or have your scouts concentrate on Cuban prospects? Eliminate the DH? Shorten the season to 156 games? Have the Rule 5 draft? ...the list is pretty much inexhaustible. Basically, if it can be done in real baseball, it can be done in OOTP. Enough reading though -- if you love baseball, I mean really love it, stop deliberating and just buy this game. You will not regret it...although your significant other might.... There has been a lot written about the ""steep learning curve"". Don't worry about that. The learning curve is no steeper than any other comparable game. While you can set up your league however you want (which means lots of options to learn), there are quickstart options to get you going immediately. From there, if you are considering buying a game of this type, then you are already expecting to spend some time with the game learning it all. Once you get going, you're going to WANT those options. The game is quite addicting, with the effect that other ""just one more turn"" games can have. Judging from the game's forums, people have been playing this game daily for years (granted, through several versions of the game). Compare that to story driven games that last a couple of days to a week, or first person shoot-ems that gets boring after only a few weeks. I gave the game a 9 since there are some rough edges that could be smoothed out or implemented better. But to be fair, I can't think of any game that's better in this genre. If you want to finagle trades, pour over stats, and be a baseball mogul, this is absolutely your game!. This game is realistic, incredibly customizable, and really lets you play baseball in any way you want, whether that is running the latest season of MLB, historical seasons, creating fictional leagues of your own, or playing international leagues. It's an amazing game if you like baseball and baseball stats, and well worth a look.. If you enjoy baseball, you will fall in love with OOTP. It's worth noting right off the bat that this is not your typical baseball game. There aren't graphics or animations, and you don't actually play out the games yourself. Rather, it's more of a text sim that puts you in the role of owner, manager, and coach, allowing you to build and manage every aspect of a baseball franchise in a real or fictional league. The depth of the game is enormous. You can set up a league that takes place in the current day MLB, or start in 1957 with all the proper teams and players, or simply create your own fictional league with its own structure, teams, and players. Or a fictional league with MLB players. Don’t like minor leagues? Don’t have them. Got a custom logo for a custom team? Upload it and the game will use it. If you want MLB logos or actual player pictures, there are free downloads for them. If you don’t like the current playoff structure or schedule, you can edit both to suit your needs. Want to play out every game for a season? Go ahead. But if you’d rather take the reins for a 30-year career as manager, you can do that, too. Or play for 100 years. Or 200. The game will keep generating fictional players for as long as you want to play. You can sim through a game, or a week, or a year, or manage every game on a play-by-play basis. Literally the entire game is at your fingertips, to be edited and played as you see fit. Yeah, the game has the occasional bizarre AI decision, but it’s to be expected, just like in any strategy game, and honestly, it happens far less often than most games. The amount of work and care that goes into every iteration of the game is just phenomenal. It's a must-have for any baseball fan.. This is one of the best baseball sims ever. I mean it's not for everybody. Don't expect to go into this game swinging the bat as Hunter Pence and twitching a controller to get the perfect 100+ mph fastball as Aroldis Chapman. Do expect to be able to manage your teams finances, control lineups, trade for players, draft, and learn more about the front office in baseball and have fun while you do it. Amazing detail, amazing game. If you love baseball, then this is the game for you.. After I bought OOTP a few years back, I stopped playing all other games all together. OOTP is an extremely realistic baseball simulation game where you're given the option to play out each game or sim seasons at a time. You have complete control of your leagues and can do just about anything a Major League GM, commissioner, or manager could do. Buy it now and don't regret it.. A very detailed, advanced simulation of professional baseball, both the on-field game and (perhaps a little less successfully) the financial side of the sport. You can play any current major league team, or any team from any year in the past. You can also play a fictional team in a fictional league. You can play games out in detail, or you can ""fast sim"" any number of games at a time, from one to entire seasons. The options are beyond your imagination want to play a league in Thailand, where the roster size is 28, they don't use the options rule, and batting averages are high? A little experience with the setup options, and you will be able to do exactly that. The draft and player development are quite realistic, and if you play with scouting on your personnel decisions will be just as complex as those found in real life. Lots of multi-player online leagues are available, easily located on the game's website. I'm rating the game as a whole a 9, thinking of single player. Online mult-player is a 10+ It's a text based sim, so you are not watching live action, but the player pictures are pretty good. A world of customizable stats are available, supporting very deep strategy. Downsides: 1) The user interface remains somewhat less than intuitive. You'll probably struggle with where to find things for the first hour or two. 2) A few features never seem to work quite as well as the rest of the game trading, AI opponent logic, feeder leagues. 3) This is a very small operation, and, as a result, response time to technical problems can be kind of slow... although one can get some kinds of help on the forum but don't post blunt negatives there, the crowd on that board can be fiercely protective if they feel criticism of the game is unwarranted.. This version of OOTP offers a number of improvements to the core game, including an even stronger statistical model that helps the simulated players develop exactly as you would hope inconsistently but realistically. Definite buy for any fantasy baseball guy or gal.. If you are a baseball fan, OOTP is an absolute must-own. There are so many different ways to play this game, and all are wonderfully detailed and immersive. Want to start a game with the 2013 Boston Red Sox and try to recreate their championship run? You can do it in one click. Want to create a fictional baseball league with 16 teams that all play in different countries and have completely different rules than the MLB? You can do that too. The customization of this game is incredible, and replayability is endless. Give the demo a shot, I guarantee you will be hooked before long.. The most addictive, Immersive, customisable baseball simulation I've ever played...whether replaying baseball history or creating an alternative baseball reality.. If you are a fan of baseball and baseball games then this game is a must have. I have played baseball games on platforms such as Nintendo, PlayStation and PC. NONE of those games come as close to the pure realism and pure entertainment as OOTP Baseball has. You can customize OOTP to suite your baseball style. Plus, the optional add-ons the can be downloaded from the Add-On Central can only enhance your game world. These add-ons contain things such as team and league logos, ballcaps, jerseys, player faces, ballparks. Most games when they load are boring, aren't they? Well, OOTP baseball even provides quotes from real former players and managers and baseball tidbits while your game is loading! Bottom line: The possibilities with OOTP baseball are endless. OOTP baseball is your baseball universe customize it the way you like it!. OOTP is not only the best baseball text sim, but also the best sports text sim. Love its depth, customizability, and flexibility. Creating fictional baseball worlds, with its own customizable features in terms of rules, schedules, league modifiers, finances, face gens, jerseys, etc.) is a breeze in OOTP, and can't be matched by any other game (as far as I know). Your imagination is the only limit when you play OOTP!. OOTP gets better every year. It might not do or be absolutely everything to anyone, but it seems like every year there's at least something big and new for most. Unfortunately I don't have the time to play OOTP as much I used to, but I do recognize that it is better every year. I do worry that it might be too complicated or detailed for newcomers, but we keep seeing plenty of new people in the community so it must not be too difficult to get into. My biggest wish for the series at the moment would be for it to fully flesh out league affiliations. That was a huge feature to me a version or two ago and many of its issues were fixed, but I'd just like to see affiliated leagues have separate and joint histories, awards, and all that good stuff, not just be joined in the limited manner that they are.. If you love baseball or are a fan of sports sims this game is dead on solid. Play it right out of the box or customize it pretty much any way you want. Great online forums with awesome suport from both users and the developers. Online leagues and free user created mods to top it all off.. It's your game, play it your way! This is the best way to describe OOTP14. You can do pretty much anything you ever wanted within a baseball universe.. Best sports Sim you will ever play, hands down. If you love baseball you will love this game. If you kinda like baseball you will still probably love this game. The only negative to this game is that it can be overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of it you won't stop playing it. Final Comment: Just get it. Its fantastic.. This game is so realistic, which is why it's so fun for me. I get to make my team how I want them to be. I'm in total control and I just enjoy seeing the history of the league unveil. You know a game is good when you are genuinely sad to see a fictional player retire.. Outstanding game that keeps getting better with each new version. It is the most realistic baseball sim on the market well worth the time and money to play it. It is a must buy for serious baseball fans.. OOTP 14 is THE best baseball sim game on the market, bar none. You can replay any season in baseball's history with real life rosters and transactions. You can create fictional leagues with fictional players or use major league players from any season, or you can use the current season's players and rosters and play out ""what if"" scenarios with your favorite teams and players. You don't have to pay extra for any season disks or add-ons, and the game forums are the most user-friendly and detailed of any on the Internet. The game is geared towards the strategy/general manager side of baseball, and although you can play out every game if you want, the graphics are not arcade quality and the game is not designed for that yet. The developers are quick to respond to user problems with the game, and they always have an open ear for suggestions. Rosters and players can be edited fairly quickly, and there are literally thousands of options when designing leagues. The learning curve for this game is fairly steep. You can't just pick up a controller and start playing. But if you believe in hard work equating to big rewards, then this is the game for you! You will not be disappointed with the features.. The best and most comprehensive sports sim out there, Definitely a must buy for any sports game player. OOTP makes winter into summer for me. Metacritic should get this review page sorted. They list 5 negative reviews yet I can't read them. Why is that? **** gets negative reviews we should be able to see what people think the problems are. Perhaps they couldn't figure out how to do something and they could be given some help.. OOTP is fantastic year in and year out, with v14 being the best yet. A huge range of customization options available and an excellent community of users make OOTP an absolute joy to play.. Excellent baseball management simulation, well the best one actually, as all the scores and reviews will tell you. Made by a company that cares and is very active with it's users. The learning curve, has mentioned, is steep but if you take it step by step, watch a Youtube tutorial or just check on the forums (where you can have questions answered within minutes usually) its nothing to be afraid off. Play modern MLB, historical seasons starting in 1800s! or even make your own baseball universe in any country you want, with any rules you want! I rate it a 7 simply because there are a few things I personally would like to be added into the game.. A pretty big learning curve that pays off in the end. For those people that are big baseball fans and people who love stats, This game is a must. High replayability. Good mods and fanbase.. OOTP Baseball Simulator is a great simulator and the most realistic one I can find. YOU are in control for as much or as little as you would like. You can play starting with the opening day rosters for that season, do a historical replay starting from any year, or even create your own custom leagues, without any limits. I love playing OOTP whenever I want to play some baseball. With some more tweaks to make the AI even better, this would receive a 10..

868.Overboard!,"While I typically look to games to provide some action and excitement there are sometimes games that come from less hardcore roots that can still be very entertaining. I consider Overboard to be on that list, dropping you off into a story right after the point your character has decided to throw her husband to his death off the side of a cruise ship with your goal being to somehow get away with it. Working as a mystery somewhat in reverse you’ll definitely need to do some research by talking to a variety of characters to suss out opportunities to blur some lines and throw up some smoke but it’s tricky, and it’s going to take you a number of runs to try to work out a viable path for success. What really makes it work is whip smart writing, in particular for your witty main character who has some great observations and choices that certainly just get her into even more trouble with the hopes of somehow using those actions to your advantage in the end. This may be one of my favorite interactive narratives I’ve played on the system. ****/2021/06/mini-reviews-jun-7th-edition-nintendo.html. This game is underrated.

87.Super Smash Bros. Brawl,"great game must have on the wii but it feels like casual players were the focus although subspace is actually the main reason to play this and if subspace was it own game i would even rank it higher than brawl in its entirety great story alright smash not a perfect but a good game none the less. I'm not that into this franchise and this is one of the few smash games I've actually played. I grew up with it so I am a bit biased but I've also only played Ultimate and 3DS besides it. I've heard people say that it's the worst in the series and maybe I'll have that same opinion after I've played the rest. (probably won't since I hate handheld games). This game has some of the most fun campaigns, however this game suffers from being a series. Melee and Ultimate are both better and it ends of making this game feel useless cause you could play the others. But the music and game is still good so yeah 7/10.. My favourite childhood game links my favourite character I love the subspace emissary I was so shocked when sonic appeared it was so surprising it whould if bart Simpson was in it 10. A good-looking game for the time but not nearly as good as Melee or the one for Nintendo Switch.. True classic. Great story mode. Could have used more balanced characters, but that was achieved in Ultimate. I wish Ultimate had a bit better of a story to invest in. But overall, great game here!. I don't know who has a Wii these days, but I still have one and I love this game. The game doesn't have that much content, but it was what they had back in the day. 10/10.. I may be biased, but Brawl may just be one of the most important games ever. This game is the first video game I have ever played, and it was my gateway into the world of gaming. In the context of the game's release, this game expanded upon the Smash Bros. formula up until that point, incorporating third-party characters for the first time, a move that would create some of the most exciting discourse in gaming. The game isn't perfect, however, as returning to Brawl after playing any other game in the series highlights how painfully sluggish the game often feels. Random tripping and unbalanced characters make this game tough to take seriously for competitive play. In addition to that, this game is pretty ugly. However, the game does things that I wish Smash Bros. still did, like the Subspace Emissary mode, which while not that cohesive, made Smash Bros. feel like a universe. I understand why it never really came back, but that mode absolutely made my childhood.. Brawl is a celebration of video game history unlike any game that came before it - and in some ways, unlike any ever since.. Subspace emissary does it for me. Stage builder does it for me. Online does it for me. Special Smash does it for me. This is my first Smash game. There is definitely bias for that alone, but with the addition of Subspace story, this has to be my favorite entry. It offers more new and exciting upgrades than any smash before or after.. The story mode is nearly perfect and the roster is great for its size, easily one of the best games on the wii. Arguably the best in the series because of a few things. In terms of introducing new characters relative to Melee and easily the best in terms of Storyline. The game introduces characters within the Subspace Emissary and it makes me more worth it when unlocking new characters and the overall buildup.. This game has Olimar, so I was considering giving this game an 11 out of 10. But I do not like the random tripping, it was a weird decision to add it; so I could only really give this game a 10 out of 10, which is coincidentally the highest score this site lets me submit.. Brawl had some great additions to the franchise, including story mode, create a stage, Assist Trophies, and of course Final Smashes. It also adds plenty of new characters to an already solid roster of characters. Where it loses points, however, is in the slower paced gameplay, the random tripping, and the challenge modes not being as diverse/challenging as Melee.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The existence of the story mode alone already makes this game the best smash bros of the series. Sad that the gameplay of the entire franchise is not really the best it could be. ""Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a celebration in game form that brings together iconic characters from Nintendo and other universes in a battle full of fun and mayhem. With a wide variety of playable characters, exciting stages and unique special moves, the game offers a fighting experience that combines fast action with mechanics accessible to players of all ages. In addition, the extensive single player mode, along with multiplayer modes and the amount of unlockable content, ensure hours of entertainment for fans of the franchise and ""Fighting game lovers in general."". It's pretty good, better than 4, absolutely. This game honestly gets more hate than it deserves, and really isn't that bad, unless of course you look at it from a competitive perspective. And even then it isn't that bad, random tripping isn't too frequent, although I think we've all seen the clips. Great game to just play with friends, and subspace puts World of Light to shame, not even close.. Despite its flaws, this game has its moments. The story mode is what everyone talks about with this game, and it’s easy to see why. It’s got platforming sections, enemies for you to kill, and by far the best part, the cutscenes. Despite being a Wii game, this game has by far the best graphics on the Wii. It runs at a smooth 60fps, every character is incredibly detailed, and it has this dull look that looks similarly to Twilight Princess. However this is all for the single player mode. As for the actual gameplay as a fighting game, it’s not great. Stiff controls, random tripping, and very low hit stun which makes it impossible to combo your opponents. But that’s honestly what makes it fun to go back and play it. It makes up for its wacky mechanics. You can chain grab for combos. Some are literal infinites. And I can’t mention Brawl without mentioning Meta Knight. Remember when I said you can’t combo? Well Meta Knight says NOPE! Ridiculously fast moves, great kill power, and amazing recovery is what makes this character the best in the whole series. This was also the first Smash Bros game to introduce non Nintendo characters, that being Snake and Sonic. Even though this game doesn’t have everything that makes Smash Ultimate so good, it’s still a fun time to go back to it every once in awhile and just laugh at the goofy stuff you wouldn’t see in future Smash games. And of course the story mode which is the main highlight of this game. If you haven’t played it, I highly recommend that you do. Plus it’s beginner friendly since that true combos don’t really exist. So if you want to start playing Smash Bros, this is a good one to pick up.. Genuinely one of the best games of all time the gameplay is really fun even if unbalanced and the story mode is genuinely fantastic! The only thing I dont really like is the tripping, that's the only thing of the game I really hate. (Super Smash Bros. Brawl main theme) Audi famam illius. Solus in hostes ruitet patriam servavit. Audi famam illius.Cucurrit quaeque tetigit destruens. Audi famam illius. Audi famam illius. Spes omnibus, mihi quoque. Terror omnibus, mihi quoque. Illeiuxta me.Ille iuxta me. Socii sunt mihi,qui olim viri fortesrivalesque erant. Saeve certando pugnandoquesplendor crescit. (English Lyrics) I've heard legends of that person How he plunged into enemy territory How he saved his homeland I've heard legends of that person How he traveled the breadth of the land, reducing all he touched to rubble I've heard legends of that person I've heard legends of that person Revered by many--I too, revere him Feared by many--I too, fear him Now, that person Stands at my side Now that person stands at my side Now my friends are with me Some of them were once heroes Some, my mortal enemies And as we face each other in battle, locked in combat We shine ever brighter. Online was broken, balancing wasn't great, mechanics were questionable... but it's still a masterpiece. The absolutely legendary newcomers, the outstanding new soundtrack, the radical new stages, and the unforgettable most badass crossover story ever mended all in this one package. Yes the game was ""almost perfect"", but it's also better than we deserved and so much more than we asked for. Thank you Nintendo for the best smash game to date.. This game has earned a perfect rating from numerous sources and there is a good reason for that. Here is to hoping the trend keeps up for any future SSB games.. Beat Super Smash Bros agame, has the best stages and characters.. Complex and deep mechanics Infinitely varied Amazing soundtrack Excellent multiplayer Technically flawless Story mode that I still have in my head. Possibly the best game ever made for the Wii.. This game was so hype. Remember the Smash Bros. dojo? Brawl has such an amazing roster of characters and one of the greatest single player modes, Subspace Emissary, in any fighting game.. this game is great for the soul purpouse of the extras like the coin shooting game, the giant roster of trophies, and the subspace emmisary. the only issue is that the balancing is off in numerous ways while also failing to follow up on the tight and swift combat of melee... i just think that this game gets worse with time while melee ages like gold.. An amazing title for the wii, I'm actually pretty nostalgic of so many memories the devs gave my brother and I when we played this as kids. You've either played it or you haven't, it rocks.. I really Love this Game. This is my für favorite Game of all time. The reason ist because the Story Mode is PERFECT!. The story mode is perfect but the game is an 7 because of Meta Knight and tripping. the funnest smash game, the jank makes this game hilarious, i have never had more fun laughing at my wii ever... i would like to leave you with one word which i believe makes this game so fun and funny... warioman. Masterpiece. This is so fun to play with friends and it also has a good story mode! I really enjoyed playing this game and I still recommend getting it in 2023!. This game has a pretty cool story mode, graphics, the music are very great, the nerfed of the characters is one of these issues, meta knight is very broken, easily the best character of the game. but overall is a great game.. First smash game, my main was meta knight and I learned many years later that he was considered overpowered. The main story went so hard and I wish they’d do it again, when R.O.B had a change of heart it made me almost cry. But not this man get back in there tear.. One of the games that made me a gamer, and one of my favorite childhood games. The gameplay is very fun and addictive, so many mechanics to experiment with, albeit being a bit slow and heavy. Subspace Emissary is one of the best additions to the game, and playing with other players makes it even better. Last but not least, it's worth to mention that this game has the best original music in the series and the best remixes aswell. Back then I didn't know many games, Brawl helped me discover so many new games and characters, and I'll always respect it for that. Overall, I had the time of my life playing this game as a kid with my siblings, it's a one of a kind experience and I'll never forget the times we've spent together playing this game. Final Rating: ""Excellent"" ~ 9.5/10.. I loved it so much, Wario is my favorite and his big fart is so good. The knight guy should be better cause he looks cool by can't beat anywon. I also love KINGDEDEDEE because he is really good. 100/18.7432. Super Smash Bros Brawl was the first Smash game I played. it marked the beginning of my love for the Super Smash Bros series and piqued my interest into the competitive scene of which I am now a part of. It's nostalgic as all get out and I have fond memories of intense 1v1 fights between my brother to see who was better or blasting through the Subspace Emissary on a snow day when I was home from school. I truly cannot thank this game enough for all the childhood memories I have with it and how it impacted my life, but man is this game flawed. Nintendo intentionally sabotaging the game's movement speed to discourage true competitive play also hurts casual play severely, I can never go back to the molasses slow gameplay of Brawl after playing games as smooth as Melee or Ultimate. Furthermore, while the story mode is really cool I think it's heavily carried by the cutscenes and the story it tells and not the actual gameplay of it. If I wanted to play a side scroller where every enemy that hits you does an insane amount of knockback and just are incredibly annoying to fight, I'd play a Mega-Man game. While Brawl was certainly revolutionary and a big part of my childhood, I can still see a lot of its flaws through my rose-tinted glasses.. This game is brilliant. The graphics are amazing for a game on a wii. The character roster has great diversity. The only complaint is meta knight. Really fun game with great battle maps and a really good story mode. The amount of content in this game is just great. Tournaments are really great when playing with friends and the character roster is huge.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This was my very VERY first Nintendo game I have ever played. This game is a huge part of my childhood. I will always main you, Mario and Sonic. Yes I do know that this title is debated to be bad, even so this is the smash bros I played the most, since it was also the first I played. For me this title has a special place in my heart even more so than melee, which I also love. Brawl has its flaws but overall is the most well rounded game cause of its balance of multiplayer and singleplayer modes.. Brawl's roster is amazing. Newcomer's Sonic and Snake are some great additions. Compared to Ultimate, Brawl's gameplay is far weaker. The Subspace Emissary really carries this to an 8. The amount of cutscenes and unique never seen before interactions that happen is simply awesome.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is by far my favourite Super Smash Bros game in the series! It was the first game to introduce final smashes unique to each character, and there are so many good ones! Most characters from Melee return along with a big list of newcomers like Wario, Diddy Kong, Meta Knight, King Dedede, R.O.B, Olimar, and even Snake and Sonic who were the first third party characters in the series. There are so many cool new stages to choose from as well as 10 coming back from Melee. Some of them include Delfino Plaza, Pirate Ship, Spear Pillar, Halberd, Castle Siege and many more! The wii remote controls aren’t the best but I’m okay with them, and you have the option to use your GameCube controller. The graphics were a huge upgrade from the previous entry. The soundtrack is massive with hundreds of amazing music tracks, and you can choose which songs you want to hear on each stage with my music! There are many different trophies to collect with an astonishing 544, and you can get some in the coin launcher minigame which is fun! Events matches return and are as fun as ever, with many different single player and multiplayer ones! This game introduced the stage builder which allows you to create your own stages, which was such a great idea! The best thing about this game however, and the reason I consider it the best in the series, is the Subspace Emissary! There is a large amount of cutscenes which tell a really good story without even any dialogue, and a lot of different 2D sidescroller levels to play through specific to this mode. This game is a masterpiece and to me is the definition of what makes Super Smash Bros so good.. 8/10 The game that is once hated. I'm surprised that the user score isn't 2.0.. It may not have had the best fighting. But it wasn’t bad at all. And it had the adventure mode that still hasn’t been bettered today. Great Smash title. It may not be as fast as melee. But it has its own unique charm.. This was one of the first Wii games I ever played. I played it for the first time at my best friend Jack's house. I played as Snake and was the first one to lose all my stock. It was only up from there lol.. Controls, animations and graphics are terrific. It is a real pleasure to manipulate all these varied characters without effort even if 'Super Smah Bros. Brawl' definitely is part of that 'easy to learn - hard to master' category of games. The soundtrack is iconic (and thank you so much Internet for bringing it back to life as a meme - ""Smash Bros Meme joins the battle!""). As if it weren't not enough easter eggs in the game itself! It sometimes looks as a perfect Nintendo museum! Story mode is astonishing and punctuated by amazingly epic cinematics. It is perfect to begin the game with it so it forces you to play different characters. They are really interesting to play but yeah, they also are not well-balanced unfortunately. Bosses are more than memorable, collectibles are fun to get even if there are way too many of them. Objects also are great to use. Multiplayer mode could have been way better. Maps are varied and truly fun to discover.. Can't believe how many people complain about this game just because it's different than Melee.. It is the weakest in the Super Smash Bros. series, but Brawl has a ton of effort and fan service for not only Nintendo fans, but video game fans as a whole.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is a really good game a great game enfact. The reason this game is so good is because of the story mode the story really feels like a massive cross over and the addition of sonic and snake in the game this is a pretty good game. This game gets a lot of slack from the melee community for being completely different to its predecessor with all the tripping and slowness and i get it's annoying but if you look past that it can be a great game especially with it's campaign i suggest picking it up if you have a wii.. Absolutely underrated nowadays. Sure, the competitive side of it isn't that balanced, but since its gone it doesn't matter and the new characters make it even better. My Main: Ness. this game isn't that bad, it's quality is good and it's pretty fun with friends. i had fun playing this game as a kid, and i will likely never forget that after replaying it months ago. it was amazing playing it again after a long time.. underrated masterpiece one of the best games of all time I am going to play subspace until death. For some reason, this game seems to be considered a bit of a black sheep within the Smash Bros series, and that is a shame because this game is absolutely stellar. Sure, there are a few gameplay choices which are frustrating - tripping, slower meta, etc. - but even for its flaws, this game is exceptional. This game introduced the full-fledged story mode we may never get again: Subspace Emissary. Not the best platformer in the world, but the mashup of characters with cutscenes to demonstrate the storytelling we all have in our minds as little kids pitting their favorite characters against each other. Yes, the meta for competitive gampelay is broken with Meta Knight dominating the roster and with many glitches that top-level players can exploit. This is one of many reasons why its competitive aspect hasn't stood the test of time. But the gameplay is still fun to revisit with a new roster of characters, including my personal all-time favorite, King Dedede, to other great additions such as Snake. The music is absolutely fantastic, and yes, does take itself seriously in some regards, but I appreciate that the composers and game directors made the choice to do so and fully went with it. Casual play also is a lot of fun with the introductions of assist trophies and of course, final smashes. As imbalanced as the final smashes are, ranging from Mario's astonishingly weak fire attack to longlasting fury of Super Sonic, these were also among some of the most fun. I'd rather have some final smashes back like King Dedede's Waddle Dee Army or Giga Bowser rather than some of the new additions we have for Smash Bros Ultimate, which seeks to get players back into the match more quickly. Overall, a gem ****. Not the best in the series, but often undervalued for how well it still can stand on its own even through its flaws.. Brawl is a very flawed Smash game, but still really fun. It is probably the least entry I played (not counting 64) but I love the roster of characters and is still a blast to play with friends.. It has the best story out of any smash bros. game by far, with a great chaacter slection, and lots of great side things, like stage builder, and versing 100 cpu's!. This is by far my favorite smash game. Just because a game isn't built for competitive play doesn't mean its bad. I love this game despite all of its flaws. There's so much to do and I find most of it to be a blast.. This is my favourite Smash game, mainly for two reasons. 1. The newcomers are some of the best the series has ever seen - Meta Knight, Pit, Snake, Wario, Pokemon Trainer, Diddy Kong, Lucas, Sonic, King Dedede, Lucario, Wolf and more! 2. The Subspace Emissary is everything I've ever wanted. Still can't believe that happened!. One of those games that made me a gamer, and one of my favorite childhood games. The gameplay mechanics are very fun and addictive, it's definitely a blast! Subspace Emissary is one of the best additions in the game, and playing with a other players makes it even better. Last but not least, it's worth to mention that this game has the best original music in the series, and the best remixes aswell. Overall, I had so much fun playing this game with my siblings, it's a one of a kind experience and I'll never forget the times we've spent together playing this masterpiece.. While Super Smash Bros. Brawl is the most controversial game in its series, it's still an amazing time. There are eighteen newcomers. Those being R.O.B., Sonic, Snake, Wario, Diddy Kong, Ike, King Dedede, Lucario, Lucas, Meta Knight, Olimar, Pit, Pokémon Trainer, Toon Link, Wolf, and Zero Suit Samus. Perhaps the weakest point of this game is competitive Smash. Gimmicks like slipping really make fights feel a little less fair at times. The heavily ambitious Subspace Emissary certainly makes up for it though. The Subspace Emissary is an adventure mode where you'll traverse through stages to unlock new fighters. The difficulty can be altered before playing each stage. There's also a 2-player option to play with a paisano if you feel lonely while beating up Zelda. In conclusion, Smash Brawl is an amazing Smash Bros. game that is certainly worth a go if you like to play casually. Have a lovely day/night, folks!. I actually really enjoyed this **** a Fun Nintendo game with interesting things.Even if you are a Melee Die-Hard fanboy you at least have to acknowledge that a lot of work was put into this game even if its not as competitive or hard.. One of the best Wii games IMO. The nice sized roster, the music, and the controls are awesome even looking back years later.. Essential game for the wii and for all lovers of fighting games. Loaded with content, characters, settings, items, and collectibles. A jewel.. Random tripping and Meta Knight are dumb, but God, what a game! Even though by many its called the weakest in the series, I love this game and will defend it until the day I die! This is a big expansion over Super Smash Bros. Melee, even though they tripped up over some things like Target Smash. But still, re-watching the E3 Reveal of Brawl is so breath-taking, and the addition of third-party characters made this game not just a Nintendo crossover, but a video game crossover. The stages are really good, and they brought back a lot of Melee's stages. There are some small stinkers like 75M, but you don't have to play on it if you don't want to. The Adventure Mode is leagues better than Melee's, although it is pretty generic, its a lot of fun. If you own a Wii or Wii U, you definitely need to pick up this game, its a must-own for any Nintendo fan!. [ ] Perfect [x] Awesome [ ] Good [ ] Good Bad [ ] Fail Não vejo necessidade em escrever um longo texto analisando uma arte, a nota é apenas um conselho para saber o quanto ela vale para sua vida. I see no need to write a long text analyzing an art, the note is just a piece of advice to know how much it is worth in your life.. This game is tied with SSBU as my all time favorite figthing game of all time, i adore every part of it, and the story mode is one of the best thing that the entire franchises has had, the soundtrack when you compare to other entries in the franchise is even better than the others, with great remixes.. This has been the best game I have ever played in my life. I got it when I turned eleven years old, and played it until I turned fourteen (THREE YEARS). The Subspace Emissary storyline, the multiplayer and singleplayer action and all the items and characters available, have always been the best game for Wii from my childhood. Replayed it a couple of days back, and I still like it (even though I play Smash Ultimate a lot). If you are still looking for Wii games to play, you NEED this one.. GET THIS GAME!this game is said to be casual only by the ""true smash players"" who say that its to broken for competitive but they dont research that most things that are said to be broken are banned in some tournaments and arent allowed, making the game much more competitive. on that note, i urge you to buy this game as the characters, stages, and overall feel of the game is much better than wii u smash.. If you love the Nintendo Universe and if you love Fighting this game is a Must-Have and should not be missed in your gallery. Okay if you want to play Smash competetive you might not like this game but for every other fan of nintendo, either the hardcore Single Player or the Party gamer this game is a lot of fun. So you have a cast of 35 Nintendo Characters in general, which all collide for a.. i push you of the platform battle... oh and i am gonna punch you in the face or crash me rocket into you while we are doing it. If you don't want to smash against CPU's anymore because you might have no friends, this game offers the BEST Singleplayer of the Smash Series. Sure you can spend some time on Home-Run Contest or the Multismash but ... oh boy ... this game contains a full fledged story mode with cutscenes! And what is the Story about. Well to be honest we have the Good Guys (Mario, Kirby, Link for example) and the Bad Guys (Bowser, Ganondorf, King DeDeDe, Wario for example) which want to take over the world. In order to do that the Bad Guys shoot laser like arrows into the good guys, which gets transformed int trophies if hit... okay Characters always turn into trophies if they have taken much of damage.. but you get the point. So... the story itself doesn't sound interesting right? Well it is not the story which is so great about the Story Mode... it is the cutscenes! Didn't you always wanted to see, how Pikachu gets rescued by Samus?! Oh and btw you have big Bossfights too, but i am not gonna say who you are up against. Sure the graphics aren't that well compared to the newer titles of the Smash Series but this game is always worth to play again and i think the best game to start with the smash series. The music is nice the bugs in this game are actually hillarious, Fluck of Meta Knight, Stage Builder this game is great! I highly recommend it. The game is really amazing ! ................ Until the part in adventure mode in which, after around 60%-65% completion, the game ""tells you"" to redo every level. The game design was really cool for every map.... but to repeat everything ? do all of them... all over again ? Sorry.. garbage mentality. One of the best with the worst of the worst gameplay plot twist in my entire gaming experience..... The Game's Awesome. Although it's Unbalanced, it's very fun and good for beginners. Not recommended for competitive players. I don't care what people say, this is best Super Smash Bros. game of all time.. Hard to say because of the Melee competitiveness fans that hate this game because it's not competitive enough. But Brawl is better because it has the same and more content than Melee it's way better to play with friends amd is funnier and you have a good time playing with it's variety of modes. Also it's my childhood.. To say it short, this is my least liked Smash Bros. game. It had an amazing graphic enhancement compared to melee and introduced characters that were unthinkable to join the smash roster such as Solid Snake and Sonic. A mechanic was added to only this game which was tripping. Tripping made the game less fun because you might be winning but then you trip and the other person gets a good combo making him/her take the lead. Overall Brawl felt slower than melee making competitive smash mostly still take place on Melee.. Not Quite Melee, But.... It’s still f*cking awesome with many new additions like 3rd party characters and final smashes.. I did not own Super Smash Bros Melee so when I was young I got this game, I absolutely love it and will keep on playing. The stage builder, in my opinion is slightly better than the one on wii u because you can out backgrounds and parts that allow your stage to look really cool. My favourite mode in this game would probably be the Adventure mode, they brought it back in Ultimate however this one I played hours and hours of using overpowered characters. Sadly I never got to finish it. The modes like Brawl, Home run contest are great as usual, however with the tripping part and the new mechanics that they introduced this is probably the worst if you were to do a competitive tournament on it.. Flawless game. i give it a 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 out of 10. I think this is still a strong game but doesn't hold up as well as the other games. Some problems I have with it include the physics being too floaty and some features like the stage builder and story mode being a bit lacking. However, it still overcomes this by virtue of it being a Smash Bros. game.. This game is underrated. The adventure mod (subspace) is the best in the franchise. The only thing I don't like about this one is that it is a bit unbalanced.. This game has the worst gameplay of smash bros, other than the first one. But for that game it at least makes sense since it is the first in the franchise. It is slow and many mechanics in this game **** like tripping. Subspace emmisary is a boring slog, people only like it because of the cutscenes. The reason this has a 7 is because it, as always has great multiplayer. There is no point in revisiting this game, although I would recommend it for younger kids. The roster was also great at the time.. A game that alone isn't so recommended, since its adventure mode is unattractive. The MultiPlayers will always be fun, it's a Smash, but it doesn't reach the quality of Melee.. A great fighting game with tons of ideas and really fun gameplay overall. Subspace Emissary is the highlight of this game with incredible cutscenes.. this is what got me into smash bros- epic game, i would play it every day. looking back, it is unbalanced but fun. just don't play it on wii u because wii mote ssb ****. if you still have a wii and some GC controllers, it's a must have. except tripping- this is more of a last resort ssb game for me now. this is game is awesome just play it its good however if you want a better experience download the mod project m. This game ****, the gameplay is horrible and the contro",brawl is one of the few smash games i've actually played . i've heard people say that it's the worst in the series but this game suffers from being a series . the music and game is still good so yeah 7/10 .
870.The Witcher: Enhanced Edition,"Why bother going to all the trouble of releasing an Enhanced Edition, but not fix any of the dozens of game-breaking bugs? The frame rate is much improve, but otherwise same nonsense from the first game. Constantly having to reload saves in order to progress missions. Riding Roach still ****. (Seriously the worst horse in modern day gaming.) I appreciate that the update was free, I only wish it had actually enhanced the game. Typical CDPR ****.. While it has some rust around the edges and some notches in its hilt – like a trusty silver sword, it stays reliable and true whenever you reach for it.. Pretty generic monster fight game. Shows its age in todays gameplay. Can be enjoyed without too much expectation.. It's really janky and the combat is a mess. But, the world is lived-in, the lore is great, and Geralt is a badass. Rough around the edges but the potential is there.. The atmosphere of the game is just crazy good, and is the best of all the witcher games. Act 1 was terrible though, and I almost dropped the game because of it. Luckily I didn't, and I ended up experiencing a really good game. The weird sexual cards were definitely a choice.. And the fact that women just threw themselves at Geralt was pretty weird.. I just wanted to give this elf woman some bread and the next second I'm met with one of those cards.. Luckily the story was pretty cool, and the sidequests were enjoyable. The combat is often called ""bad"", but I think it was unique and new, which made it pretty fun. Sometimes it became repetative, but it was also kind of satisfying changing between different swords/stances and having to press at the right moment.. THE ATMOSPHERE THE MUSIC THE STORY THE DIALOGUES THE CHARACTERS Perrrrrfectly made combat is a bit tough but you dont really mind it after some time Graphics didnt bother me when it was at maximum level Still playable masterpiece. This game is just so beautiful by it's simplicity. Yeah, Witcher 1 may not look so good but the gameplay makes it wanna play and play and fall in love with it eve though the start **** is a little bit boring. Lovely story, interesting characters and locations. I really felt that my choices are important. Definetely one of greatest games and I can not wait for a remake!. Interesting role-playing game. The plot is good and surprising. It also represents current era problems in the story, like drug trafficking, society moral corruption and politics. The game play could be a little bit shorter, because some quests are too simple and takes a lot of time to complete. I spent 80 hours with this awesome game!. (this review could be affected by my nostalgia for the game) I remember downloading this game in 2013, booting it up and falling in love with everything I saw. This game hooked me into the Witcher world the first second I tried it with it's very heavy, dirty and real world that does not pull it's punches. The characters are greatly developed and have a lot of backstory (technically we could call it a ""bookstory""). The only thing this game really needs is a refreshed fighting system, which I know for a fact is the main issue most people have with it. The graphics are definitely dated a ton, but bear in mind this is a very big game from at the time very small company in 2007.. So for every rpg game which is made after 2004 i will say it's Fable like game ... :P ; anyway i love this game especialy becouse of the Wicther 2 . Combat i very intresting but script could be better.. Beautiful game. Great story and a great plot. It is pretty good at keeping you wanting to play as long as you enjoy a single-player game in the third-person view.. It's a game you have to give opportunities. Don't mind that it's old. It can still give you hours of fun.. the control and combat system are a bit inconvenient, but the plot is great. It is clear that the game is made with soul.. The Witcher is an action RPG released in 2007. It is based on the works of Andrzej Sapkowski. Now where to begin. I had been a fan of the Witcher books long before this game was announced, unlike vast majority of the fans in the West. And so when it was announced that this game is going to be made, I was really sceptical. A new Polish game studio, with very little experience was trying to recreate that unique Witcher atmosphere in a AAA wannabe format? No chance anything good can come of that, I thought. Boy was I wrong! I still remember my first playthrough. Not only it wasn't a disaster, it was actually great. And they nailed the Witcher atmosphere. Lets talk about that for a while. I truly believe that the Witcher is quite unique. Sure there are other, much more brutal and vulgar and obscene and visceral fantasy worlds. But I love the Witcher world for being, at its very core, truly cynical. I just love that. And the developers truly managed to transfer this feeling to this game, which alone is a praiseworthy achievement. But there is so much more to this game. The graphics is very good for its time, with the somewhat bleak colors brilliantly portraying the somewhat bleak reality of the world. The loading screens and story decision cutscenes art is just awesome. The music is great, it fits the Witcher world perfectly. The main theme proved to be such a hit that it remained a main theme (with some changes) for both successor games. I always liked the Murky Waters tavern song, such a merry wedding song in the midst of all the suffering and war. The main story itself is actually very short and quite simple, and honestly, I do not think the mutants were even necessary, but it works anyway. Mainly because it is very often intertwined with the many secondary storylines and together they make a great game. The prologue is a tutorial, Act I gives you much more, but essentially it is closed off and can be considered an advanced tutorial. Then Act II and III are pretty much connected and in my opinion, this is the best part of the game. The game turns into a grim detective genre and again it works excellently. The game does not hold your hand, you must make your own deductions and reach your own conclusions and you can easily make a mistake, which will cost you. The characters are great, believable with typical bitter Witcher sense of humor. Then Act IV takes you into the country, but problems follow you there and add to those that are already there. In Act V you pretty much reap what you sowed. Epilogue gives you the obvious and expected ending, but with one (almost) hidden twist, that you can quite easily miss, which puts it all in a different perspective. One thing that the game has been criticised for is the combat. It is unusual, bit weird, bit repetitive, but it was not a problem for me. I got used to it quickly and then it felt normal ever since. The game does get a bit too easy towards the end, even on the highest difficulty, but that is a normal thing for RPGs. The talents are almost all passive, but with a quite a lot of freedom, so especially sign oriented builds definitely deserve a replay. The next thing I want to mention is the choices. You are making choices almost all the time, some are felt immediately, some are felt only much later, some are not felt at all, but they still affect the world in major way, even though you do not even know about them. Almost like the real world. In the most general sense, you can choose between Humans and Nonhumans. Or you can refuse to choose and remain strictly neutral in a Witcher way. It is great that you have that choice. Throughout the game you can also partake in drinking competitions, bare knuckle fighting and of course the excellent dice poker. One last thing: the romance. This game offers you basically two major romance options and then plethora of trysts (including a tryst with Triss, which can turn into a major romance spanning all three games). Your achievements on the fields of love are then forever recorded in the forms of in-game collectable cards with paintings of said females in often quite revealing positions. One of the greatest gaming ideas of all times. And all these things together make up the fantastic atmosphere I mentioned before. A bit dark, a bit sad and really cynical. I have nothing negative to say about this game. I played on PC and completed the game in about 50 hours. Naturally, no microtransactions and no SJW. A Witcher 1 remake is now in development and once again I am pretty sceptical and cynical about it. It will be open world, which might change the gameplay drastically. I truly hope none of the modern world SJW netflix cancer will affect this remake. By the way, don't you dare touch the sex cards. The Witcher is a fantastic game, that was somehow followed by two even more fantastic games. The more I play this excellent game, the more I am convinced that the remake is utterly unnecessary. Final Verdict: 95 %. This game didn't age well. It would be really cringy and shameful to play this in 2023 if you are not a fan of this universe.. One of the best RPGs of all time! I can't believe the many choices that completely alter the entire game! You have so much freedom and the game reacts to your difficult, grey choices. Almost no other game does what the Witcher does. It's soooo good!. Had to give this a 10 because i saw it's the lowest rated witcher game, while it's actually the best. Period.. And so it was that the legend of the White Wolf took shape on our PCs!!! I played through it for a second time in November 2021. I wouldn't go as far as calling it a must-play game, but it still has its merits. Let's just say that since the first installment, The Witcher has presented a story filled with twists and intrigues, devoid of mundane quests. It does have its limitations, but it also shows its age. If CD Projekt were to revamp the combat, fix the inventory system, improve the textures, and find a solution for the most tedious quests (which often involve traversing various locations with just one running style, resulting in unnecessarily long trips of 25 minutes instead of a quick 7/8 minutes on horseback), you would have a hidden gem in your hands.. Fantastic story and characters. My main complaint is the boring combat system. Unfortunately, the graphics don't age very nicely.. One of the best games ever made. It has it all: a great Story, Gameplay, World building, and graphics. it all begins here. the best story ever written ibn my opinion. for 2008 the gameplay is very decent i would love to give more but the technical issues i had almost every where the 7 is the best what i can give. SHORZZ / The Witcher: Enhanced Edition: The Witcher Game Series might be the most detailed RPG games you'll ever play. The reason is based on the books. Witcher (1), combat is very strange in our current system. It feels boring and awkward at first, but it gets more playable once you get used to it. Pretty good game with RPG elements. It was a good game for its time. Play and experience the game.. Sorry for the low score. If I look at it objectively, I can see that the game is excellent. But I started playing this game only to experience the preceding story before replaying Witcher 3 for the 5th time. In 2023, I can't bring myself to continue with this game. I'm sure the story is amazing, but I lost it when I had to walk everywhere in the swamp. I played for 10 hours, but I realized that it was just torture for me. I give up. Of course, this is subjective. I am using this website only to rank my games according to my enjoyment level.. Played the game for the first time in 2013. But the hands reached the last parts, only the nearest time. Of course the graphics is outdated, but if we give rating without this thing, the game is good. It was uncomfortable at first to play because of the specific combat system, but after some time I got used to it ... however, I would not want to return to such a system again anymore. A story, a frank picture with allusions to sex and cards of girls, various monsters (with some you need to prepare for battle in advance, and not just run screaming ""for the motherland""), walking through the spacious locations, mixing the elixirs... it was a cool adventure. And, of course, it could be advised to anyone. Unless, the outdated graphics won't confuse you.. Very nice RPG game. I was playing in that game in 2021 - I did't have a chance to play earilier. Interesting plot. It was fun to finish that legendary game for the polish game dev scene. It is a good game with wonderful story, the gameplay is good in its time but if you want play it in 2023 it is annoying a little bit - 7/10. Despite the age of the game, it is still playable. I will definitely play the remake someday. It is not easy to review a video game played sixteen years after its release, especially considering the context of the development of this first title by CD Project Red and the limited means they had at their disposal. The Witcher is a video game that ""oozes"" love towards the original work. The developers have fully succeeded in recreating in another medium the atmosphere and worldbuilding of this saga. What is most striking when approaching this title is the ""dynamism"" of the places, the interactions within them, the huge amount of dialogues that are never an end in themselves, but always go to tell something about that world and have a real impact on the story. This last feature was not always implemented perfectly in the video games released at the same time as the first The Witcher. Nonetheless, even in its strengths, there are some sloppy points, to name two for example: 1) characterization of NPCs not always consistent; 2) ridiculous romances. Another flaw that is impossible to gloss over concerns the way the narrative of this game is constructed. Several times during the story, I had the perception that this, but in general, the whole narrative set-up including codexes and more, is aimed at those who already know the world of The Witcher. Compared to a similar title, such as the first Mass Effect may be, The Witcher does not have the ability to grab you and fully involve you within the game world, especially if you know nothing about it. Before moving on to the main criticism of this game, which everyone mentions when talking about it, it is important to talk about some elements of the game: - The sound design often comes across as crude, but it is balanced by good soundtracks that are sometimes corny, but always extremely consistent with the game; - The minigames: the dice game is entertaining and pushes you to play it more than it should, the same cannot be said for the fistfighting, which is too simple and scripted. -The game menu and Hud are poorly maintained, often intrusive, and above all not very user-friendly; - The skill tree can initially be interesting, but as the game progresses several issues related to the progression you want to give Geralt come out. The main flaw I mentioned above is the combat system, which comes across as point-and-click. There are 3 different styles of combat, each particularly effective against different types of enemies. The problem is that the gameplay becomes mechanical, simple, and repetitive from the moment you memorize which style to use and against whom. Also, the use of signs does not combine well with the gameplay; there is an imbalance between them. In conclusion, there are many other elements that I would have liked to introduce in this review, but I wanted to dwell mainly on the critical points of this title, which are certainly accentuated by the weight of the years, because these have had a considerable weight on the gaming experience . Despite this, I believe that this title can be enjoyed by lovers of the genre and that it could be interesting to play together with TW2, before approaching the CDProjectRed(TW3) masterpiece.. For a 2008 game, it surely deserves a 10 score. The whole storyline is exciting, different from many games that always has boring parts. The soundtrack is amazing and honestly far better than most of modern games. The plot is intriguing and it has a rich lore. Many complains about the gameplay, that it didn't age well. But honestly this is a lazy way of thinking and gaming. It surely deserves a remake version.. What can be said, this is where it all started (well the regular edition about a year earlier IIRC). Have been through the game 6-7 times, always same choices (eh I like it consistent). Some criticize the combat mechanics (more like the controls) but it is not that bad.. Story -Main story 3/5 -Side Quests 2/5 -Expression 2/5 -Story Direction 3/5 -main character 3/5 -side characters 2/5 Gameplay -Controls(keyboard and mouse ) bad -Combat 1/5 -general gameplay 1/5 Graphics (2008) -Environmental design 4/5 -Animations 3/5 -optimization new generation is good on record :13h. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. i think its a good strategy game, i wish the graphics were better though. otherwise good. Pretty good game! A definitely stronger game if you have read all the books and are invested in where the story continues after the books end. The gameplay is definitely dated, but better than KOTOR 1 & 2 which this games feels like a lot. The dialogue is pretty good sometimes, though sometimes quite janky and fairly empty. Overall, I'd recommend it mainly to those willing to play Witcher 2 & 3 as well, as this game doesn't merit playing just alone.. I liked this game very much for its novelty, complex plot, a world that is so bright and different, versatile characters, freedom of choice, both for good and for bad, that is, you make your own choice and make it, and of course the main character, the witcher Geralt. At the beginning of the game, Geralt lost his memory and the witchers find him, his memory will be restored throughout the game. There will be a lot of characters in the game, both positive and negative, many of them know Geralt, and even believe that he died, but Geralt does not remember anything, and this gives its own zest, and some irony on the part of Geralt. Throughout the game you have to face different types of monsters, knights, magicians ..., perform various tasks of your choice, you build your own Herald, let your choice be correct. You will also learn how to forge weapons, magic, and will create elixirs, as well as seduce beauties and have affairs with them! The game is very interesting, I advise everyone!. The game is good and may have been a masterpiece in 2008, but in 2022 it’s very difficult to play it, to put it mildly, due to the extremely **** combat system, poor graphics and difficult pumping, with constant freezes and crashes, all this can be fixed with mods, but if you just want to buy the game and not worry, you'll have to get used to it. The plot is 10 out of 10 and only for the sake of it this game is worth going through.. Played this game after finishing Witcher 3 and although it's not as good, it was still fun. I absolutely love the setting of this game. Also, simple graphics giving it even more those ""dark vibes"". However, i didn't finished the game. I tried. Three times. And eventually i gave up, because i just can't. The combat system and clunky walking system sometimes pissed me off for a little bit. And some quests are way too boring... So... you should give it a try if you're a fan of old-school RPG's.. If you're a modern gamer, then this game may feel dated to you, but to get the most out of the Witcher story you should still play it.. Pros: - Very cool story, with a system of choices that influence interesting details throughout the story. - Interesting graphics for a 2008 game if memory serves. Cons: - Battle system much less kkk, not to say it's bad. - Some very useless sidequests, and we always do them with fear of being important. - There is no achievement system on Steam Well, I think it's really worth playing, even more so if the goal is to play the following games, because you can load the saves, and decisions, but the story alone pays off a lot, it's extremely engaging.. The best aspect of this game is the side missions and the story. The weakest aspect is definitely the combat it's just too outdated. The lowest point for me was the fourth chapter it just drags for too long and it feels unnecessary the game would have been much better without it.. First of all, the gameplay of the game is very good, but the game has a very big deficiency. You understand what to do in the narration, but you can't understand where to go, it's not like that in witcher 2 and witcher 3, I tried the real thing, but I couldn't understand it because everyone went to different places and I quit. It's good for those who love the genre, I'm already witcher 2 satisfied me, all the troubles in witcher 1 were gone. Anyway, after that. I bought it for 0.15 cents. (2.85 TL) It was pretty good, it was 2.5 hours.. This game is a truly masterpiece. Story:10/10 Combat:7/10 (the worst thing in the game) Main Character:10/10 Side Characters:9/10 Rpg Things:10/10 My fav rpg game of all time.. A janky gameplay experience alleviated by incredible characters and atmosphere.. It a good game. I liked his history and his characters. His music is good for the game that it is. A great game with a very good story, characters, choices and quests. unfortunately, there's too much of running around, backtracking to truly enjoy this game at leisure. I wish there was a fast-travel system or something which lets met finish off the quests much faster. I played till the point where I had to get downer's brains. I killed off a bunch of them without finding any brains. Gave up at this point.. Great story. Beautiful atmosphere, like in books. The graphic and fight system are not good. But the whole game is really nice.. I needed 3 attempts to get into the game because I was put off by the combat and graphics. But let TELL YOU something: after the first few hours the story **** me in and I started to like the combat! You just have to get past the first few quests, and then you will feel the ""magic"". Of course, grpahics are 2008 and look dated nowadays. But the overall impression and the atmosphere are amazing! The feeling is better than in many modern games. You can download some mods to make the textures better and fix some things. Pros ------ - Excellent story - Good side quests - Combat can be fun if you get used to it - Very good music - Awesome, likeable characters - Several skills / potions / improvements available Cons ------ - Quests tracking is not so good, sometimes you don't know what to do next - Inventory **** a mess, but you will get used to it - Combat can be annoying sometimes, espceially the mobs. But you will find separation techniques for them - Voiceover (german): Rittersporn / Dandelions voice is very amateurish, but all the others are professional - Quicksave will create 500 savegame files at least so you should delete older saves from time to time If you are a Wticher fan, you will enjoy this. Also I recommend reading the 9 books! Witcher 1 is not as sophisticated as Witcher 3 but also a good game.. My favorite Witcher game, very close to Witcher 3. Great story and characters, just like in the books! Some says that combat is not so good, but I think it's at least has some variety compared to the typical action-rpgs.. My fav singleplayer game, and I would recommend this game to anyone. Great story, OST, gameplay, anything. Controlling is not even that hard like people think. Also lotta mechanics and variability in builds, as well as the choices you can make, will definitely make you replay this game at least once.. Quite boring game. Everything is slow and ugly. Graphics are poor and grey. Most of the game is located in different sections of a city that always look the same. There are really few NPC and monster models, so you are always dealing with an NPC Clone Army. The scenario sections are so tiny, with lots of loading screens between sections, like accessing houses, caves, different sections of the city... Combat lacks a lof of responsiveness. Lots of twirls but almost no feedback on hits, misses, criticals ... There are really few weapons and armor and most of them are given at end game. So you expend most of the time with the same gear. There are secondary weapons like daggers but are completely useless. I still not understand the logic behind this weapons. On the other side there are hundreds of crap materials that you are almost not using. Someone decided it was a good idea to have mission logs that take up half of your inventory. Exactly what you need, more crap in your inventory. Quests are super annoying. You need to do tasks in a specific and unknown hour with an NPC hidden into the clone army. Then NPCs have the ability to disappear of change its location during quests, so you expend a lot of time searching fro the specific place and time to find someone/something to progress. I save the story that's quite good.. No, well, you understand this behavior does not fit into any framework, not at all.. Russian Lives Matter! Games should be out of politics. So you thank the Russian community for all these years of support? I wish you a speedy closure. Downgrade by order of Putin. Downgrade by order of Putin. Downgrade by order of Putin.. KEEP POLITICS OUT OF GAMES! Well, i'll be playing in your games, BUT from this day on, not a single coin from my wallet will get to you. Farewell CDPR.. I have always bought your games and supported you even if they failed. Games out of politics. None of your games will be purchased. Get out.. discrediting and persecution of people by nationality is one of the fundamental principles of **** and fascism. now it is the russian people, and who are the next, uh CDPR? Jews? the gaming industry should be above creating PR for itself on politics, otherwise you are nothing more than piece of .... unplayable game on release from company that are super politically engaged.. It's a pity to give a good game a low rating because of the ****, Russophobes of the developers.. Thank you so much for the politics in the video game industry. I am eager to tell you many interesting words, but I am a cultured person, and therefore I will convey my opinion with the following phrase: ""when everything is over and your master orders you to return to the Russian market, do not forget to wag your tail like an obedient dog"". This company has no place in the gaming industry. What you have done is theft.. CD Project disrespected all Russian players. Russian - not **** and dont want this war. Putin is not all Russian. Games is not politic. The games should not be influenced by politics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I have played this game after part 3. May bee for 2k year it is good. Bun for now not interesting!. Initially, I wanted to play this game, just to better understand the ent of the universe and thought that it would be just an ordinary and unremarkable game, but how wrong I was. Let the gameplay and graphics for 2022 be extremely, to put it mildly, mediocre, but the filling of the game is simply magnificent. The plot of the game is not inferior to 3 parts, and in some aspects it is even ahead, the quests in the game are very interesting and soulful with an interesting story and characters. The characters themselves in the game are mostly written by hand, not taken from books and they are written surprisingly well. I would also like to mention the atmosphere and music separately, in this game these aspects are made at some incredible level.. Great writing. Very believable and living characters.İt could have been much more than that. But that COMBAT. OMG. And that GREEN DOG. OMG.. this game is really underrated. i know that the combat is awfull but expect combat everything about this game is great. this game needs a remake. and i m sure eventually cdpr will make a remake,. Great game. The time check was accurate. The main problem is in the combat system, which is incredibly tiring in the first 3 chapters. The plot and the choices are excellent. Perfect to play for everyone who has passed the 3rd witcher and who generally loves RPGs or the universe of the witcher.. One of the most underrated games, mostly because of lower graphic quality and weird combat system. Nevertheless, game offers incredible storytelling and lore, and it's very easy to get caught up in game world. That nostalgia hits you hard. Every gamer should play this game. The heritage is heavy.. The Witcher is quite a controversial title - on one hand it deserves to be among such monumental games as Fallout 3 and GTA IV but on the other hand the condition some of the technical aspects of the game are in are unacceptable. For example, the NPCs - was it really that difficult to create more than just 3 skins FOR THE WHOLE GAME? Believe me, you will think you are going crazy after seeing the same man or women over and over and over and over again. Then we have this unnecessarily complicated tree of abilites and a bunch of alchemy ingridients 95% of which you don't care about because the mixtures you can make with them are basically useless. Ah, and yeah - the game is pretty easy. I played on normal and only occasionally I struggled with my foes. If you don't have difficulties dealing with your opponents you don't have much reason to care about all that plenitude of different mixtures you can make and of course you could care less about your charachter level and skills. Considering we are talking about RPG here it is not a good look. Honestly, the whole game (okay, at least the first half of it) feels like a beta version of some game which still will need at least 3 months to be ready. I don't understand how someone could let the game to be released worldwide and to not see all the problems that were present regarding NPCs, the difficulty, the dialogues, the gameplay, the music, etc. Of course the world is deep, interesting and feels alive which is unsurprising considering all the source material available thanks to 8 books written by Andrzej Sapkowski so there isn't much the game developers should praised for in this regard either. Pretty much the first half of the game was ""meh"" but it really picked up the steam in the second half and starting from the forth chapter the plot got really good(if it didn't the game certainly would be rated ""6"" or even ""5"") - it is as though the second half of the game was made by completely different people or the writers and producers actually learned something along the way while making the first 3 chapters and thanks god because otherwise we would never see a sequel.. 7.5 / 10 ️ - Good (after 49 hours of playing & completing the game) Overall great, but the game mechanics are incredibly clunky and hard to get used to. Ugly graphics. A more serious plot in the world of moral shades of gray. If we get over everything else, it's worth it for her. I like the dialogues but gameplay itself is very clunky, especially combat and movement. The marshland is especially annoying because of nonsensical map limitations. The maps are small and limited, but seem bigger because there is no fast travel so you have to run a lot from A to B and to A again. The main story is meh, but like I said the dialogues are very well done.. THE WITCHER: ENHANCED EDITION is amazing fantasy RPG game. The graphics for 2007 are nice. The story was interesting and the characters were also well written. The game design and environment and even the soundtrack are great. The main and secondary missions were well written for me. The combat system is good but he limps a few times. Czech dubbing is weird in some places, but I still enjoyed it a lot and English dubbing is also great. The game takes home 9.5 / 10 for me.. True masterpiece from Poland. The best thin","the game is pretty generic monster fight game. Shows its age in today's gameplay. Can be enjoyed without too much expectation . the world is lived-in, the lore is great, and Geralt is a badass ."
871.F1 2017,"The 2017 chapter in the excellent Codemasters F1 series features a more detailed career mode, with deeper car development, which will improve the car’s track performance. It also includes options which allow you to really fine tune the AI difficulty to suit better your abilities and make for even more exciting championships. Finally, it also features a return of classic cars, although there are no classic tracks like in F1 2013. The best F1 game yet (and I have played the all) !. First of all, I'm going to say I'm a single player first and foremost. Keeping that in mind... This game is absolutely worthless. The AI is the same we've seen since ToCa Race Driver as the drivers don't race for their own success, but to prevent the player from being successful by any means necessary - usually this means running at the player not unlike a freight train, or in case of the player not being near enough for that, driving in an inhumanely perfect fashion 100% of the time. On the flipside in regards to fast racing, when driving slow behind the safety car for example, the drivers ahead of you may slow down so much that you end up becoming a ghost (a terrible feature that you can't disable) while they don't and at least one driver behind you gets a legal overtake as a result. And when it comes to AI ramming you, after the AI pushes you into the barriers and ends your race, the other teams' interest in you diminishes by a ridiculous amount as if you're the one to actually blame for even trying to be on the track. Every. Single. Time. And this often breaks the whole contract system apart unless you somehow manage to be lucky enough to upgrade your car to beat better teams - which would normally happen around season 3 at the earliest. The weather system is also one of the worst I've seen in an F1-game: there are four different stable percentages (let's assuming it's 0%, 33%, 67% and 100%, condition wise it's ""dry,"" ""light rain,"" ""heavy rain,"" and ""HR w/ standing water"") that are always the same if the weather doesn't transition to anything else. The track is evel less dynamic as it's the same amount of wetness in all parts, of course depending on the overall conditions - actually, it's technically not at all dynamic, even if Codemasters have falsely advertized (illegal, by the way) it as such since 2010. Plus the physics are terrible, most evidently in case of car-to-car contact. If you want good examples of F1-games in simcade or sim-categories, pretty much anything you saw as a Sony-exclusive and Crammond's Grand Prix series was more advanced and realistic than this amateurish construct that makes the sport look bad in the eyes of a person who knows even the tiniest bit about the workings of racing.. F1 2017 is not a perfect game. Specially the Online mode is very improvable but on the SinglePlayer modes it is outstanding. Great career mode, great move with the addition of classic cars, physics are very much improved, although graphics (at least on the drivers' and people's faces alike a PS2 game) have to be improved, the rest is good. Maybe it is the best F1 game since F1 Championship Edition or F1 Challenge 99-02, or maybe the best even above them... 2018 can be great, think about it.. I played this with a wheel and.... wow. The physics are the best ever, graphics are epic, the sounds are really good and it throws so many options at your face which makes it so cannot dislike the game and it fan as... An extremely fun thing... I didn't bother too much with the career but from the time I played it was good. It also gives you a lot of modes with a lot of cars. Even if there was a lack of tracks this didn't bother me and I if you get this game, try ramming into everyone and try to immobilise them, get them off the track and destroy their car, it is super fun! I give this a chocobo outta 10.. The last F1 game you might ever buy for what's going to happen next year. I wish they added every single classic car and track from every era on top of 2018 because really i don't want to buy another copy for this 2017 season. I usually sell the last copies to afford the next year; having the classics would really help until F1 get's better, it's very sick. I don't particularly like the new cars and the way F1 is being run, and it's going to get worse next year but the game this year isn't bad it's basically the same as the last 3 years. Particularly the tyre colors are making me depressed, now they have pink ones, it's not even the hybrid electric futuret. Having the few classic cars I can play might help me cope with the lose of F1, even though it's still with us and miss F1.. F1 2017 plays almost identical to F1 2016, plus a few minor changes like older golden era cars. Unfortunately the car physics is still sub par and the damage model is still a bad joke. And the graphics looks like 2015 not 2017 - Driveclub (2014) and GT Sport (2017) look way more realistic and better than F1 2017. Now that the Driveclub developer works for Codemasters as well, I really hope F1 2018 will have comparable great graphics to Driveclub next year! And please take a look at Geoff Crammond' Grand Prix 4 (2002), just bring more Formula 1 details and polishment to F1 2018!. Great visuals with very solid game-play & works well with the normal controller (PS4) - great to see a game released thoroughly tested and quality from day 1. If you find working through weekend practice sessions repetitive, try one of the other modes. Would suit fans who love F1 but should also appeal to others who enjoy the driving/racing genre in general. This is were the assists come into play, and help turn F1 into a casual game almost anyone can enjoy, to a game a seasoned F1 or sim pro would be challenged by. Great effort Codemasters.. I'm not one to write reviews for games but I thought I would go to the effort as I am having heaps of fun with F1 2017. Unlike previous F1 games where the AI was either too easy or too difficult there is now a slider to change the percentage of AI difficulty which allows for finer tuning to suit a vast array of play styles and expertise. Fuel management during the practice sessions and the classic F1 cars are great additions to the series, although I would like to have seen a Benneton F1 car included. The game runs at a very smooth 60fps which is a must when it comes to racing games for me. My only gripe is that there can be some screen tearing which is quite noticeable but I can forgive this as the rest of the game is near perfect. This game is a must buy for any F1 fan. There is also enough new content to satisfy people who played F1 2016. Do yourself a favour and buy this game.. Didn't have huge expectations, rather a small update on 2016. Wow. Beautiful work Codemasters. Physics are improved, graphics are very much improved, classic cars are beautifully rendered, I can say without a doubt this is the best Formula 1 game/simulator I have played, and I have been playing for 20+ years. Since Geoff Crammond's Formula One racing simulators and perhaps EA's F1 games developed by ISI, we have not had anything this polished and complete. Can't wait to see the future of this series. F1 + Dirt have put Codemasters at the top again! Only con? Lack of VR. How amazing it would have been to drive these classic beauties in VR. Finally we can administrate almost everything from motor to chassis development. We can progress the game sweetness. Graphics are very good, We can hope for better results in 2018 for graphics. Great almost simulation game.","the 2017 chapter in the excellent Codemasters F1 series features a more detailed career mode, with deeper car development . it also features a return of classic cars, although there are no classic tracks like in F1 2013 . the weather system is also one of the worst I've seen in an F1-game ."

One of the best, most underrated indie games out there, made doubly impressive by the development company's obscurity & status as part-time devs and sadly held back by various public misconceptions, the primary one being that it is a ""bullet hell game"" and thus ""doing it wrong"". Despite classic arcade-like design principles, it's not a ""nostalgia game""; it can hardly be described as ""X meets Y"". Maybe Sin & Punishment's cinematic on-rails presentation + a shmup's bullet dodging + Alien Soldier's sheer variety of stuff to do... but that wouldn't really do it justice. It's not really a bullet-hell; I'd have trouble calling it a shmup. It's more of an... anime mecha game. You control a robot while locking-on, shooting, sword-slashing and comboing your way through various perspective-shifting stages. You have two normal shots (activated by tapping their respective buttons) & two lock-ons (holding down their respective button). The lock-ons are a forward & spread shot respectively, either targeting around you in a circle or in a straight line. Your slash is more than it seems at first glance; sure, you can quickly tap the attack button to do a fast combo, but this can often leave you open; sometimes, AVOIDING the longer combo attack by timing your presses just right is the better way to go. You can also hold on to the sword button along with whatever direction you want to dash towards, sword-first. Lastly you have a variety of context-sensitive special attacks; if you press the special attack button while locked on to nothing, you will damage whatever is near you (the range of this effect increases once you unlock the second mech) and creates a short aura of invincibility around you, which adds a nice element of strategy. While locked on to a large group of enemies, your mecha will automatically home in on them and slash them up at a crazy speed; meanwhile, while only locked on to a single enemy, you will pull off a very anime-esque move on it taking out a significant chunk of its health. The scoring system is easy to understand and hard to master and involves plenty of practice of all the aforementioned skills (once again, refer to the tutorial on scoring). Many will feel that the game will completely destroy your fingers, but if you find yourself mindlessly mashing the normal shots chances are you're not playing it right; the lock-on is very useful throughout most of the game and balances out the button-mashing quite well. The on-rails camera-shifting (from side-scrolling to vertical shooter to behind-the-back third-person) is truly impressive; it helps add to the game's variety while also making for interestingly-composed cinematography. My only two significant gameplay gripes are the balance issues and the lack of a DEFAULT option to set the movement keys to WASD. The latter, however, is easily fixed by googling ""Astebreed WASD"" and getting the Astebreed tweaker from the Steam forums (however note that sometimes it might create a strange delay for the directional keys; if this happens, just restore the defaults and set your own controls again). The former might just be a result if my (crappy) play style, but it feels like an area in stage 3 along with the last boss are both a bit too much of a difficulty spike. Even then it's nothing as big as, say, the contrast in difficulty between Ikaruga's first and second stages. Beyond that we have the occasional bizarre crash when using the ""restart game"" feature, but this can't actually destroy one of your runs, so I can look past it (also my computer is an ancient piece of garbage that was old even when I got it in 2008 and I can't even properly play this on max settings) This is also a short game, but if you're into arcade games this should not be an issue; arcade design is not about artificially creating ""pacing"" by stopping the action to force you to solve physics ""puzzles"" or pushing a block over a switch, which can be an issue with otherwise-great games. There is no exploration and no grinding; the game's world is not your oyster. Good arcade design is about pure non-stop gameplay bliss, a barrage of creative enemy formations and set-pieces that will stay with you for years. It is not about offering the player the illusion that they are forging their own path, but about creating a pre-set obstacle course and then giving you a very wide variety of ways of making your way through it and grading them based on their inventiveness. Replayability comes in the form of beating all the modes with all the mechs, 1CCing hard more and improving your global score.. A very good casual SHUMP. The graphics are great, the configuration options highlight what I love about Japanese games; missing a few key resolutions, but up to 4k scale, full button rebinding, and an audio config menu that puts US games to shame. All localized to English. I said casual, because it is trying to be more cinematic and therefore more forgiving since the focus is moved more away from bullethell and more towards the storyline that they seem to have put a good effort into. It's a SHUMP for couch play and those that are just getting into the genre. Good music (nothing really memorable,though), manga cutscenes that can be skipped, and good subtitled voiceacting make this an enjoyable game. $14 is a great price, and on sale, it is a steal.. Great visuals, audio, art and character design and, above all, brilliant gameplay. It's frantic shooting 90's style but uses modern hardware to switch the game mode from horizontal to vertical to 3D seamlessly as you plough your way through legions of enemy mecha and space ships. My only criticism is that the game feels too short, but considering how much fun it is, you'll be sure to replay it again and again.. One of the best SHMUPS indie games i EVER PLAYED..Really **** graphics,the game,the characters its really awesome!!.Since i was playing this always..I've never been bored in this game. I like to play arcade style shmups and they seldom release on PC (or if they do they come with a low console-quality resolution). This game is fun and looks great. It isn't difficult to get from stage to stage, but the game does offers enough challenge for score chasing that drives you to re-play for a perfect run.. Truly bland and ordinary shmup with questionable mechanics including the boring"" feels like you're not even controlling the gunfire"" drag-reticule-across-the-screen aim. Full of annoying incomprehensible non-translated dialogue - the back and forth banter is unbearable. A sub par game with extremely misleading reviews and an overall disappointing purchase. Metacritic ought to investigate how this ordinary 4/10 made it on the top of their ranks for a bit. Inexplicable.. Although slightly overrated, this game was a fast, fluid shoot'em up with a story behind it. The game is meant to be played through multiple times and is worth doing so.. It's pretty good for what it does. The story is so cheesy, i had to look away from the screen in some cut scenes (you can skip them, though). However, the gameplay is great. It lasts about two hours, but i feel like the game has a great re-playabillity. It's one of those games you will pick if you have to hit half an hour of time to kill and you're going trough your game list. Astebreed? Oh yeah, i could play that again. Works for me.. the game grafis is very good, the storyline is good. The character is like ne*n g*nesis ev*ngelion. This not bad, the game is too short finish the game and bored if you playing again.. Bought this seeing the universally great reviews. Obviously I forgot that how **** everyone can be in their taste of media content and in general. To cut to the chase, I played one game of this on normal difficulty. At first, I was really impressed. All looked ultra slick and cool. But before long, I didn't know what the **** was happening. Despite not having a clue what was going, and how the aliens were all sying and I wasn't, despite getting battered with their sometimes unavoidable flak and gun power, I got to level 5 before I died. yes, that is right, level fkn 5 before I died, and even then I am sure that I only died out of boredom. A game that requires no skill to win, is not a game, but an interactive 'light show' for a computer monitor. I was annoyed at blowing £10 on an interactive light show for my monitor.. really very good game...enjoy while playing this game, and graphics also **** score is eight out of ten and physics mechanism also very good in this game...really very enjoyable game .****/. Great flashy arcade style shoot em up game. This game was made in Japan and has the whole japanese/anime feel to the game play and story. Sometimes it can be tough to read the subtitles but only because the fights are so intense. One of the best action arcade shooters I have played in 2014.. I love shmups to death This is in the uncanny valley of great shmups. It's great! But it falls just a bit short of being glorious. Benching against Ikaruga (one of the best shmups of all time) Astebreed takes a lot from its spiritual predecessors and delivers a solid drop kick to the face of arcade space blasting. Think the beauty of Ikaruga, camera of Einhander and some of the mechanics of Radiant Silvergun with even more in store all wrapped up in a crazy fluid and chaotic package. Oh and it has a better, more fleshed out story than any of the aforementioned. First and foremost, it's a blast, literally, such enjoyable mayhem. It's easy to feel like a badass saving humanity. Story is good. Has some EVA aspects (. Cheap bullet hell arcade game. It plays okay, but for people who do not speak japanese reading subtitles is virtually impossible. The game constantly spams the players with enemies and numerous important plot details at the same time, coupled with a lot of typical anime-style chatter from the protagonists. It's barely decent button-mashing, but nothing else.. It's an ok game but honestly there's better bullethell flash games out there now. They may not look as cool, especially with the shifting camera angles and such, but the gameplay on them is more challenging and more fun. It also doesn't help that the voice acting is in Japanese and there's no subtitles. When you're busy dodging and killing you can't really read subtitles, so storywise I had no idea why I was killing these alien robot thingies.. So I saw some random video online of this game, saw it for 20% off on steam and decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed in the game. The mechanics are great, and the game forces you to balance between using lock on shots, melee, and standard shots throughout the game. In the final boss battle, if you have not mastered all the systems, you will die. A lot. Graphics are great, game supports 1440P as a display resolution (seems to be a 50/50 thing with indie games) and even up to 8K. The game does have a cohesive story (if you can follow it, more below about that), and lets you skip cutscenes so you aren't stuck watching stuff instead of blowing **** up. I also like that the game has a shield system that recharges when you don't get hit. It makes it less frustrating than most bullet hell games. It is still easy to die on the Hard settings, and you don't get combo points if you take damage, so there is always incentive to not get hit. So a few reasons why this game doesn't get a 10 - Too short. I understand that it's supposed to be a score attack game, but still, 6 stages is a bit short. I still find myself going back to beat my old high score, so the replay value is there. Japanese only voice acting. Now, this normally isn't a problem, but when the actual text for the story is flying by super fast, and the only way to get it is the (very small) English text in the bottom left of the screen, you miss out on huge chunks of it. The game is a solid 8.5, and I would recommend to anyone that enjoys shooters. Rounding up to 9 because the game deserves that instead of the 8, especially with the melee mechanic system that plays a pivotal role in the game.","despite classic arcade-like design principles, it's not a ""nostalgia game"" it's more of an... anime mecha game . you control a robot while locking-on, shooting, sword-slashing . it's not a bullet-hell; i'd have trouble calling it a shmup ."
873.Unicorn Overlord,"TLDR: despite the stupid name, this is a must buy switch game from a struggling studio, great technical performance with very original (inspired by Ogre Battle) combat the feels like Pikmin crossed with XCOM, very pretty and deserved to win strategy goty :( While the writing (really just the english localization) is a bit bland due to the fact they just replace normal words with the most fancy thing they could find on **** which makes it sound off in the english dub, and I recommend playing with japanese voice lines because the english dub makes the writing sound even stupider, the story is still serviceable. I've never really liked older style RPGs, (anything turn-based or grindy) but it plays really well on the higher difficulties as the ""normal"" one is nothing. Don't want to make this to long but you can find this game pretty cheap on Amazon and looks absolutely beautiful, great soundtrack, became one of my favorite games on Switch after the first 5 hours :) P.S. Also while the overall plot is mid, I feel like this is the first rpg i've played where npc dialog (if not about telling you a game mechanic) is actually interesnting. Just wanted to say that because in so many games as a whole npc dialog is just nothing just ""oh nice weather"" unless its a main quest or something. Basically this game just has so much charm. A fantastic game which is highly underrated. I loved taking the time analyse and prepare my Army for battle. The music is great and the storyline, although one dimensional kept me wanting to get to the end of the game. One of my best games on the PS5 so far,. I had a lot of fun playing thru this game. I would say it's a must if you like TRPGs, beautiful art style, lots and lots of characters to choose from, addictive gameplay (IMO). I give it an 8/10 but I'm very tempted to give it a 9.. I think this game is true GOTY of 2024. It’s sooooo good. I love this game so much.. I loved every mission in the game. It is very fun game to play. I love playing with some of those powerful items building chain effects.. If you like hours of bland , dry dislouge and hour of tutorials and hour of looking a blurry 2d pictures with literally every level looking the sand, then you will like UO... This is a budget bare game charging top dollar underthe aroganance of being artsy.. For me by far one of the best games of the year. One of the highest peaks reached by an SRPG.Gameplay that never bores and always surprises, the story is engaging and well-structured, the design from characters to objects to locations simply amazing, the soundtrack is mind-blowing.Vanillaware, Basiscape and Atlus have once again hit the jackpot with what deserves to be one of the GOTY nominees.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Love this game! Great map 9/10 , great gameplay 9.8/10 , story acceptable 7.8/10 Graphics so smooth and chilling 8.4/10. Really addictive gameplay loop and absolutely beautiful 2D artwork. This game really scratches the itch of satisfying tactical RPG.. The combat programming is very interesting, the art and music are good, and the maps are large enough.. A classic tale of a prince's revenge, with exquisite art, outstanding music, captivating characters, and a feast for strategy game enthusiasts.. 5 kg of Ogre Battle. 2 liters of Odin Sphere. 5 tablespoons of Final Fantasy XII. Half a pound of Gameboy experience immersion and presentation greatness. A pinch of Triangle Strategy and Fire Emblem. Tied up with FF7 Rebirth for my personal GOTY. A total masterpiece and actually underrated at 8.8 opencritic. I would give it a 10/10 in a heartbeat. Fantastic game… deep rich story line, rewarding and engaging game play… I could go on…. This game is fun and very addictive. First of all look at your screen, you are litterally playing in a fantasy anime of high quality. Vanillaware is one of my favourite dev for their art, and dedication to gameplay. This strategy game is not boring, not tedious, always fun and spectacular, and the fact that you just prepare your units, their gear, weapons, tactics, and composition then watch them grow and become beast fighting for you, is a great pleasure. I can't stop playing this game, i love it, as i loved dragon's crown. Thanks Vanillaware for your high quality games.. now this is a good game that square enix could learn a lesson from. not much to say except KINO! 9.79/10 (rounded up to 10).. I started the demo and did not play for very long at all. It's a whopping huge **** show to me. I think the only reason I carried on for the short time I did was because it had a great OST. The music sadly does not make up for the rest. So my issues are 1. The graphics are horrible. The characters are like paper cutouts. It's not cool, or quirky, it just looks ****. The scenery and other bits just don't work. Everything looks bad and nothing looks like it belongs together. There's not a lot more to add, it just looks pretty terrible. 2. Just because the game has a medieval theme, doesn't mean it needs a medieval font. Everything is too small and hard to see. Not just the text but pretty much anything you have to look at on screen. My TV is about 55"", so it's not tiny by any means but everything on it is hard to see. It has a very cluttered look and I don't want to have to strain my eyes for every task. 3. This is my main issue. The VA and dialogue. Why does every character whisper. I've literally never heard a single person speak in a whisper tone in real life to convey an emotion. I've never heard it because they don't. Any sense of upset, or disappointment, pretty much any negative emotion and the cast speak in a whisper. It just makes it very unbelievable. Just a **** ton of poor VA, to male matters worse the dialogue is useless. Great, you gave me 10 words to describe something, how's about **** with all the pretentious words and actually give some story. I don't care how many dictionaries you swallowed, I want a story. Just as you get used to everyone speaking like a pompous ****, someone speaks like a charva and sounds very out of place. I just don't see any reason why I would ever choose this over Fire Emblem. Even the Fire Emblem's I didn't like, I still preferred to this. It looks cheap, it sounds cheap (not music), it's boring. I have nothing to give any sort of review score point for because there is nothing making me want to continue playing. I might go and give the OST a play to hear it without the **** game interfering. £50 game. I would have been disappointed at £10. Is my score going to be representative of many people - no. If you're in to pretentious ****, with poor graphics and terrible dialogue, then you'll love it. If you like something that looks polished and tells a story well, then look elsewhere. The SRPG's on the online subscription are way better and cost £30 for the lot, for a year. I can't remember which it was but I played a good few hours of one of the Megadrive SRPG's. Might have been called Shining Force but I might be getting titles mixed up. Whatever it was, it was way more fun than this **** ****. I give 1/10 and that is purely for the OST which is a much higher standard than the game.. A tremendous job differentiating itself from FF-Tactics/Triangle Strategy or FF/Tales types of JRPGs! The level of thinking is stimulating, the challenge doable yet rewarding, the waifus. Not to mention great worldbuilding. Farming even feels rewarding and the game takes many twists & turns. Highly recommended!. I'm kind of torn on this game. The tactical combat was pretty interesting, but not very challenging. I'm also not the biggest fan of having so many characters. By the end it got incredibly cumbersome trying to outfit the large number of characters in the army. Eventually I just settled on two tank units that were basically indestructible and just gave up trying to optimize the rest of the parties. The other problem I have with such a large cast is that I couldn't care less for about 95% of them, maybe more honestly. I just skipped through the final credits showing what happened after, because I had zero investment in them as individuals after playing for about 70 hours. In hindsight, I probably should have skipped the majority of the battles to speed up the game, but then it feels like I'd be missing out on something. There is a fast forward feature as battles play out, but it could have been substantially faster in my opinion. At the 70 hours it took me to beat it, I felt like it was entirely too long, especially given the lackluster story and underdeveloped characters. The game is very loaded on the front end with battles and liberating settlements, and you can see Vanillaware's cash evaporating as they continued development. In the first two or three regions, it feels like every few feet there is a settlement to liberate and a new character to recruit and by the last two, you are just running around through single units on the map that you have to defeat a quick automatic battle, with one bigger battle eventually clearing a much larger portion of the map. The art style is fantastic though and I did really enjoy the tactical combat overall. Regarding the combat, I feel like the hierarchy of skills and management of AP and PP were interesting, but also became cumbersome, particularly in the late game. There were some really standout battles and it was enjoyable seeing Alain gather an army around him, but it missed the mark a bit for me. I really wanted to like this a lot more than I did, but I was honestly just kind of happy when I finally completed it. The battles were fun, but the management of the army got tedious and I can't say I really found the story or characters very interesting.. Had LITERALLY any effort gone into the story at all than it would have been a good game but I've never played a game with less of a story in my entire life: which is quite a statement. That and it constantly makes you do tedious useless stuff to fill time in a way that feels insulting, not to mention them shooting the LGBT+ audience of the game in the foot. It is just the most wasted potential.. I want to give this game a higher rating, sadly it has some issues that prevent me from giving it a 9 or even a 10. The goods. Firstly, I *love* the way the game shakes up this genre with an open world! I love that the game doesn't just do mission to mission with maybe something between. It's actually an open world with many different ways you can go to progress. The designs are pretty cool I do enjoy seeing what new unit I come up on. Art design is generally well done mixing 2d with 3d in a way that doesn't feel like it's in the uncanny valley like I see many games fall into. Gameplay is fairly solid I don't see much wrong mechanically. It's unique in it's style I just wish.. Well I'll put that in the bads. Story is pretty solid one when you get into it with pretty good voice acting. Though it is a bit on the basic side overall with your generic rebellion vs empire plot. The interactions between characters well make up for that, though. They make you want to continue to see how the story develops. The bads. Several things knock off points for my overall score of the game. The opening parts of the game. Honestly these were just.. bad. Not spoiling but the first hour of my game was just ripping on it because they honestly, in my opinion, put their worst foot forward. It wasn't until I was done with they lengthy tutorial/prologue before I actually got to see the best it has to offer and how great it was. The animations, or lack there of, is one of them. It's the tired mobile style of trying to simulate movement by simply morphing a single image. This leaves an uncanney taste in my mouth that won't go away. From pushing full plate mail quite far to simulate breathing to moving a body part just by rotating that portion of the image. It could have been handled much better. Combat is a bit iffy to me personally. I enjoy the idea of being able to change how your character acts, but I have issues with how it's presented. The idea is that you script an ai for your units to use. Attack a if enemy damage is x, guard if condition is y kind of thing. I think a lot of my issue boils down to how it really isn't explained why order these tactics. Honestly if they explained it by (character) delegating moves in the tutorial it would be more acceptable. Personally I would love they move towards hybridizing it with a JRPG and giving you the option to play it out personally or letting the ai do the script. Overall the game is pretty fun and I'm glad I pushed through the opening to see a better game behind the crud. Maybe if they make a sequel it will build on these parts and make an even better game.. One of the best SRPG i ever played, Its a true masterpiece. Only one minus - the game is too easy on any difficulty. There's probably no game company with better art than Vanillaware. Unicorn Overlord has a classic storyline, beautiful character designs, an interesting SRPG system, moderate difficulty, smooth pacing, and a very enjoyable overall gameplay experience.. I am sad. I am sad because I have just finished my 70+ hour playthrough of this fantastic game and Vanillaware does not do sequels. That is a shame, because I want to give this game a 10/10. And I think it could have been a 10/10, but a few small things hold it back (namely, story, inconsistent writing across characters, etc.). I do not think a DLC can get it to 10/10 either, which is another shame, because I would/will buy substantive DLC for this game if it ever gets made (more unique characters, new land, new classes, new equipment - I'd love it all). Nonetheless, I think it would need a follow-up game (sequel) with a more compelling story, consistent writing across characters, etc. to iron out the wrinkles here. And Vanillaware does not do sequels (sad face). This is easily my favorite Vanillaware game. And this is easily my favorite game of the year so far, for a lot of reasons. Chief among them is customization. The best example of this is a certain point in the game where you can craft really any team you want (with the right equipment) and it will be viable. The reason for this is that classes are only one part of the balance equation. Equipment and tactics can also make or break a team. Which is just so cool. I love that kind of depth. And Unicorn Overlord does it so well. I think I will find my second playthrough completely different from the first, because I will be trying different comps I never tried on the first, now that I know all of the classes. The visuals are the same gorgeous 2d graphics I have come to expect from Vanillaware and the character designs are awesome. That is also true of their personalities and stories, though there are definitely more than a few snorefests here and there. For those characters, I think Vanillaware could learn a lot from some of the latest Fire Emblem games, where even seemingly ""boring"" characters are funny/fun/eccentric, etc. Pretty much all of the Angel characters in Unicorn Overlord are a prime example of this, but there are more. One last shoutout to this game: so many secrets. I am not going to spoil anything here, but there are so many ""types"" of secrets, and so many secrets themselves. It can actually be a bit overwhelming towards the end, but I found hunting for them quite fun, since the rewards are often late-game goodies I would actually use. This is a common thing in RPGs, generally speaking. But the level and extent of the secrets here is like... 5 times that in other RPGs, which is what makes it something to shoutout. Anyway, 9/10. Would love substantive DLC for this game though I doubt I'll ever get it.. It's really fun to think up combinations of skills between characters. Their personalities are well-established. The only thing I regret is that there are no events where you can play with these characters even after you've completed the game.. The game is great. I love the world, I love the characters, i love the graphics. But the plot is so lame and predictable. Moreover there are so many characters that you can assing to your team that at some point you just get bored and instead of thinking what units you should use, you just buff your main units with potions and EXP to charge to the finish of the game. Anyway it is nice to have game of this genre on PS5.. This game brings a lot of aspects of classic games and modernize it for today's generation of consoles and it is a overwhelmingly enjoyable experience.. It reminded me an easy version of orge tactics and final fantasy tactic. If you like those you'll probably enjoythis.. Let me be very clear. All of u can nitpick this game as much as you want. But it IS better than Fire Emblem, XCOM2, FF tactics, Total War, Tactics Ogre, Starcraft 2, Disgaea, Triangle Strategy, etc. If we are talking raw content, substance, replayability, and rpg depth, then yes, objectively, as of now, this is in the top 3. Easily. Arguably number 1. And its almost not close. I didnt care for dragons crown, but theyve nailed this game. Word is it took 10 years to develop. And it shows.. Gorgeous looking game, hyped and bought before finishing demo. The game definitely took risks on some unique tactics gameplay. A pity that it became a chore with no reasons left for me to continue after 7,8 hours... Game has more characters than any, yet none left an impression more engaging than the wobbling bobble heads on a car dashboard. Story is as generic and exciting as brushing my teeth, with no surprise or tension ever felt, most who passed 5th grade can guess everything from the start. dialogues didn't help in this case either, since the English localization is as superfluous and off-putting as someone random on the street to stop you and talk about their kid's college fund with the uncanny tone of Shakespeare, and following you for hours non-stop. Strategy(scratch that) tactics part is unique, and fun, for the first few hours, until I messed around with most of the mechanics, items, abilities, simplistic conditional clauses, semi exploitable combos, class progression, battlefield maneuvers, repeat repeat repeat, it felt more like doing taxes than most strategy games that keep things fresh for years. In the end it felt utterly uninteresting (5 of 10) as an RPG (let alone JRPG), and kinda playable as a Strategy(scratch that) tactical game (7 out of 10, bonus +1 for taking risk innovating, -1 for holding me hostage to the bloated intellectually sorry-rear storyline that makes it not a strategy game, which it is not, but I rather not to give it a 5 for the efforts dev put in) Simply put, it ain't fun, adding itself to the pile of games I would never finish. Since buying this game, had a blast finishing undertale instead, a simplistic yet beautifully written emotionally engaging experience, which makes coming back to this game even more of a headache. Opportunities could make this game fun: 1. a sandbox mode that save me from all the boss-has-decided-so-here-it-is story, and the instead-of-a-few-well-written-charaters-like-a-sane-person-boom-heres-60-wobble-head-with-names characters, just be a strategy(scratch that) tactic game and leave player alone to whatever shenanigans. 2. I understand the choice to not allow direct combat control and direct character attributes control, (because you bloated the game with so many elements it would take forever to do anything if player to control manually), it also takes away the agency and engagement that makes a strategy(scratch that) tactical game FUN to mess around in... What a wasted potential, and holy smoking jazz balls I complained a lot.. Very solid and fun game. I love the combat system, it has many different classes with their special characteristics but leave the battle decision at high level (i.e. you don't need to manually select specific actions/abilities during the actual combat). This makes it deep but have succinct controls. The voice acting is outstanding in this type of game. The art style and music are both very enjoyable. The rapport system is fun initially but there're too many combinations, trying to go 100% becomes too much mundane work. The game's difficulty setting is pretty good. At tactical which I played, it's not a no brainer but I don't need to worry too much about unit configurations. Trying to min max the combat is way too much for me. I'd recommend it to everyone enjoying the tactical RPG genre.. This game is a huge steaming pile of garbage. The greedy developers are charging $60 for a 2D shovelware game. It doesn't even have the AAA quality to justify the $60 price tag. The gameplay is boring and repetitive. When I pay $60, I expect a combat system with depth and detail. All the developers did in this game is put pretty lights during every move, to give players the illusion that the game is fun. None of that is fun for me. The graphics are complete trash. The overworld literally looks like a SNES game and those textures make me want to puke. It's pathetic to have graphics like that in a 2024 PS5 $60 game. The overworld's scale is completely off. The castles and trees are much smaller than the characters, but they are much bigger when you enter the levels; everything is suddenly in the right scale. It is the exact same garbage as 2D Mario overworlds. This was acceptable in the 16-bit generation and prior because of the limited hardware. This is inexcusable in a $60 PS5 game. The devs were too cheap and lazy for an accurate scale. The story is terrible. The physics are beyond horrible. The level design is a joke. ● There is no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is literally not a reason to play this game again. Charging $60 for a game with no replay value is a cash grab. And no, battling other players' defense team is not multiplayer when you can't even battle them in real-time. Let's be honest, everything about this game is literally shovelware. I mean just look at the lip-syncing; it's literally just a black circle constantly shrinking and expanding. The quality of this game is no different than Gollum or Rise of Kong. If anything, this is worse. The animations are far worse. At least Kong and Gollum are 3D and under $60. Despite the similarity in shovelware, critics scored this game much higher than Kong and Gollum combined. It just goes to show that critics have a fantasy RPG bias. There was a character whose cape has a wavelike animation as if it's reacting to the wind. It doesn't matter if he's facing left or right, the cape's wind animation is exactly the same. Where's the freaking detail? Lazy developers couldn't even get a basic animation right. It's $40 now but still overpriced. I don't recommend this game at all.. Great game. I didn't buy Dragons Dogma nor other recent games. I just bought this masterpiece and i didn't regret this.. 1. a very goo SLG 2. so good pictures 3. from easy to hard to play 4. so many tools with different weapons 5. easy to find time to play. The combination of large map exploration and strategy battles, the diversity of races and classes, and the visuals and music, are excellent.. I think the high point of the game is the gameplay, what starts out very easy ramps up slowly and ultimately gets a bit tricky towards the end was awesome. The gameplay loop of picking units, sending them to battle, and reaping the rewards was such a comforting loop that I kept wanting to play more. Setting units up with their skills and equipment was kinda overwhelming after awhile but the optimize button helps in a pinch for some of the less useful units. Some of the fights were huge and I would have loved to see more of them but honestly I was happy with most of the fights. The story was okay but pretty basic compared to their last title 13 Sentinels. The 7 hour demo basically throws most stuff at you but does save some fun stuff for the full game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Beautiful art work, phenomenal Voice acting, fun and engaging strategy gameplay. Solid story. Overall awesome game.. Unbelievably good. The art is spectacular, but I’ve always been in love with this developer’s style. The tactics get increasingly more fun and now that I’m playing on the highest level of difficulty I’m having a challenging blast quite consistently.Honestly I think it’s my GotY, and for anyone who likes games like this (FF Tactics, Fire Emblem) this is an absolute MUST and I think a wicked refresh of the genre.10/10!!. Generic and overall short story combined with the lack of active combat system leaves very little to actively engage with in this game. It looks great, but that's as far as it goes.. I give this game a 9. Beautiful graphical design in environments, maps, backgrounds, effects, and characters; Very intuitive, user-friendly, and comprehensive menu layout, with well-organized information that invites the player; Fun, entertaining, engaging, and strategic gameplay, both in battles and world exploration; It also has an RPG component; The only area where it falters a bit is in its clichéd story, but it's not bad at all, it's just like a new flavor of a familiar dessert.. Vanillaware seems to have taken the things that people didn't like from its previous game, 13 Sentinels, and focus on fixing those, at the expense of some of that games strengths. Unicorn Overload features a very robust combat system that seems simple on the surface, but can very quickly become a hard thing to master. I liked it enough, even if the game got a little grindy towards the end, just due to the amount of characters there are in the game and how many you can deploy in battle. It kept my attention where the story couldn't. It's a very generic fantasy style of quest. Where you play as the prince of a defunct kingdom and you have to save the world. And, because of the amount of characters there are here, no one really gets any character development outside of their initial quest where you recruit them to the party. It's a shame because of how good the story in 13 Sentinels was and it carried that game. It didn't keep me from 100% the game, which can take about 40-50 hours depending on how much you need to grind towards the end. Even with the generic story, I can still recommend this game, especially for the Switch since most of the combat missions here are very well suited for the console. I'm personally hoping to see Vanillaware's next game split the difference between how good the story and combat are and deliver one that is great at both.. Beautiful Thoughtful Game full of Interesting Tactical Depth and Cool Characters. The Ogre Battle Evolution we’ve all Waited for.. Yeah, the gameplay is fantastic and the graphics are to die for, it's just a shame the story is crap.. I understand this game is not for everyone. I've seen several reviews of people who love it or hate it. I'm giving this score due the amazing graphics, lovely music, funny dialogues and cute story. It's not super complex but I fell this game has a ""fairy tale"" kind of story. The game mechanics are addictive once you understand that a simple change in your team can change the result of a battle. It's different than anything I've played before. I just finished the game yesterday and I'm already at +75 hours of gameplay.. The modularization here is overwhelming in a good way. Once you have grasp on it there a lot of different ways you can build your teams and characters and win. It does suffer in terms of difficulty when you understand how everything works together, however considering it is almost a tactical jrpg sandbox I could create my own challenges and spent hours just on building and optimizing teams. In terms of combat, the more units you have, the more operations you have to perform, which can become tedious, but the overall system was unique and **** was nice to have a wide variety of characters and jobs. The story is classic and not bad.. (MY SCORE : 8.9 /10) An exciting and challenging Tactical JRPG game from Atlus!Located on the Fevrith Continent, which has five countries, namely Cornia, Elheim, Drakengard, Bastorias and Albion. And all of them have been conquered by the Zenoiran Empire led by Galerius (formerly known as Valmore). We become Alain, the prince of Cornia who was taken away from Cornia by his bodyguard, Josef, on the orders of Queen Ilenia when Cornia was attacked by Valmore! After growing up and possessing the magical Unicorn Ring, Alain becomes the leader of the Liberation Army, a coalition of soldiers from across the Fevrith region who intend to defeat Valmore and reclaim their land.There is a Good Ending and a Bad Ending in this game! And I myself got a BAD ENDING! Namely when Alain rushed to fight Galerius (At Level 40), without doing the Ritual at the altar and visiting 6 Sanctuary! And later, after Galerius was defeated, he actually manipulated Josef. The defeated Galerius turns out to be Queen Ilenia and even the Alain who appears turns out to be Galerius! And at the end of the scene, Galerius will be seen remaining on the throne of Gran Corrine, Cornia, controlling Fevria accompanied by Baltro and the Alliance and Alain's troops who have been influenced to become evil! True Ending, the final Boss is Baltro!. I put 175 hours to beat and platinum this game, I though Unicorn Overlord will be my game of the Year when the game was announced. Because I love these kind of games where they let me customize my own teams like Ogre Battle and Symphony of War does. But Unicorn Overlord got a limit. There 6 empty spots I can place each units in but in the end of the game, the game only let me place 5 units instead 6, so there will always be an opening spot for no reason, in Ogre Battle and Symphony of War they let you filled all the spots with units. That not all there this resource called Honor that the player need to get to expand units which increase the maximum size of a squad, but before that they need to unlocked a squad first. There Time Limit for no reason in every stage I mean why a strategy game have a time limit? The only reason strategy game have time limit is when the character need to go rescue hostages or civilized before bomb explode. Other these that the game is AMAZING the game let the player explore the whole map from the start after the tutorials. The game also got gambits which let the player set their units tactics (what/when skills to use in what condition). There 100+ side-quests and a lot of resources and materials to gathers to rebuild each towns. The game also let the player to choose if they want to kill or spare the enemy after battle. The game only let the player promote units once only, there no more than once upper classes. Last and not least the game also have rapport system to let the player see event between two characters. Overall: I say the game would be one of the best strategy game for this year its won't deserve Game of the Year in my book but its deserve Best Strategy Game of the Year. I would rated it 10/10 if is wasn't those negative I say.. 9/10 rounded up in my opinion 8.5 seems more right don't get me wrong though great game all round but mostly disappointed for what the rapport system could have been. Unicorn Overlord is a strategy RPG in a similar vein to Fire Emblem. The major difference is each unit is comprised **** of characters. Starting with 2 and going up to 5 per unit with upgrades. This unit dynamic makes the game very enjoyable for those who want to think through different team compositions. It felt like a complete product that is absolutely worth checking out if this type of strategy game interests you - and the anime aesthetic doesn't bother you. The story is somewhat typical with with you following Alain, who is a blue haired lord. There is a threat that has to be taken down and you are your marry band are the ones to take on the challenge. There are definitely some unique elements here and fun take","despite the stupid name, this is a must buy switch game from a struggling studio . great technical performance with very original combat the feels like Pikmin crossed with XCOM . the writing (really just the english localization) is a bit bland due to the english dub ."
874.Ground Control,"As an RTS/RTT its a great simple game. The story is ok but forgetable. The gameplay is simple and enjoyable. The graphics are good for the year 2000. There is a nice difficulty curve as you get more units and the enemy starts to be more of a danger. The A.I. can be a bit stupid and friendly fire is always on. The special abilities for you units will not fire directly towards the enemy sometimes which can be frustrating. Overall a game i would recommend to anyone. Good game. Big scenarios. Correct scale Balance of units Interesting story Good graphics (for it time). It was a fine game at that time. Graphics weren't the best ones but it was a cheap game so it was ok. Missions were not very difficult. It's an strategy game placed in the future. To sum up it was an enterteining game.. For a game released in march 2000!!! yes 2-0-0-0 (it means it was DEVELOPED IN 1999!) this game is amazing... really... handsdown amazing... try to compare it to the competition up to that date... you simply can't... but it was linear and simple and that makes it a 9/10. Please disregard infants who can't elaborate a contextual, logical review like CarcerC or Pandarve... seriously guys... pre 2000 NOTHING was this hot. Talk about revolutionary... some half a year after the release of another ""best selling"" C&C clone we get this game. While the image quality is dated, this game is by no means revolting to play even 13 years later AND it beats many of the more modern genre options in the way it implements combat and accounts for relevant combat variables such as lighting, visibility and terrain elevation AND features plausibly looking aircraft (all the modeling work errs on the side of realism). Great game.. Best graphics strategy series. Always in my memory. I don't think about gameplay because of its really stunning graphics (good optimised either). Graphic measure. Iconic. I regret this game series died.",as an RTS/RTT its a great simple game. The story is ok but forgetable. the graphics are good for the year 2000. i regret this game series died.
875.Cuphead,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. fun/10, sum to play, fun how hard it is yet it still feels fair would be a 7.8 if i could do that on here. It is funny but it's hard depends on the many things that boss use in one second and u can't do anything. Very fun game, getting better with each try is really satisfying, the music is really good and the style of the game is great. A very god game, you can play it whit your friends and is a very dificould game. Now I am waiting for Cuphead 2.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's harder than a diamond buried under a yeti's ass in the Arctic Circle. Gorgeous, throwback cartoon art style. Style and vibes to burn.. Wrong review for Xbox one (but i think nothing change) still good game recomented for all.. This game is just incredible, it has a style that I've never seen any other game even attempt, and yet the developers just some how nailed it. The music is so good and actually goes with the flow of the game. Your fighting bosses that look, feel, and fight so good, plus the game is huge. One thing I left out, this game is 2 player, so you can have a blast with your friends. This is a game where you can play the same level 20 times and its still so fun, and nerve-wracking. Next, the DLC, if you finish the game but still want more, you can just spend 7.99 for an incredible add-on that isn't just a 2 second play-through, it actually takes some time. Lastly, the story, even the story fits the 1930's theme, and I'm not going to spoil it, but it is just incredible and explains why your fighting all these bosses. If your considering getting Cuphead, just buy it, its an absolute 2017 classic, and should honestly be more than 20 dollars.. I played this game for 10 nanoseconds and I've bought 50 new controllers, 3 replacement windows and the renovation of my house. 10/10 would recommend it to have an excuse to renovate. Well, Cuphead speaks for itself. It's one of those games that despite its difficulty you can enjoy a lot!. Every boss has unique character design and attacks that make you face the fights in different ways. It took me years to beat this game, but It was quite an enjoyable experience.Regarding the art design and animation, they are amazing, you can notice the incredible job that the art and animation team did , also if you watch some behind-the-scenes videos you can see the huge amount of effort that team put into it, For example all the animations were drawn by hand, like the animations from the 30's. On the other hand, the gameplay is great, even though the game is quite difficult you feel complete in control of the character, allowing you to become better and better over time. As I always say, difficult games are great as long as they provide you with tools to face those hard challenges.I'm pretty sure that in some years and the future I'll come back to beat this game again, I'll never forget how much I enjoyed it. MY favourite indie title of all time as of now. Never saw a (small) game packed with that much love and details like this one!. Cuphead is one of the difficult games that I have enjoyed the most due to its gameplay and art. This game is a very notable game for its art similar to that of Disney in the 60s. This game, although it does not have much difference in the levels, is a great game. the most 10/10 game I've played, literally couldn't be any better. Its perfect and easy to understand but hard to master.. One of the most funs I've had playing 2d videogame. Even though they didn't go hard for the different playstyles, they absolutely went all out for the bosses and platforming sections. Each of them pushes you to try different approaches to the game. I don't even have to say this, but Cuphead has amazing soundtrack and visuals. On top of having a great artstyle, it's the imagination they put in each frame.. The classic visual style is amazing and fits really well with the many great and unique boss designs in the game, there is no bad boss and that is the main point of the game making this an absolout masterpiece. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Although this game can be very annoying at times, the satisfaction of completing the game and all of its challenges is just completely worth it.. Cuphead is one of the best games ever made and no one will change my mind. It's not my favorite that's for sure. I still haven't completed it and I don't plan to but just the challenge it offers and the art style it has is worth playing it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This homage to 1930's cartoons is a hardcore side-scrolling shoot 'em up. It consists of run n' gun levels and boss fight stages. The game plays out like an old-school shooter similar to ""Contra"". You'll die plenty of times, while learning enemy attack patterns. Timing your moves and attacks are the keys to a hard-earned victory. And as you progress, you'll earn points that can be used on various upgrades. Playing in solo mode is fun, but you'll get the most out of ""Cuphead"" with a partner in co-op. Overall, I would rate this with an 8.5 out of 10.. This is so cool. I've heard so much of it's difficult before playing it, but I didint think it was all that difficult. It is challenging, of course, but if you try for while you get there. It's great fun, and I loved playing it on switch, the graphics are even more beautiful on handheld. Cuphead is a masterpiece, from the astonishing visuals that mimic that of the visuals seen in early Felix the Cat or Mickey Mouse cartoons like Steamboat Willie, to the astonishing soundtrack by Kristofer Maddigan, all the way to the creative character and tough boss design, paired up with fantastic controls and spaced out with short but sweet Run-n'-Gun segments, cuphead checks all the marks for a masterpiece, the only true issue I can see with it is how since boss patterns are randomized it stops being so much a skill test and becomes more of a luck test with skill, I won some of the harder fights like Dr Kahl's robot or The Phantom Express, often times by pureRNG, but that's were the complaints end, all around, a masterpiece that should be seen by anyone with 20 bucks to spare, and, if youthink you're for it, throw an extra 8 for one of the best DLC expansions since the season pass for Batman Arkham Knight. A game truly Well-groomed. Fun levels. Animations and music Fantastic. Consigliato.. Such a great game. I love the gameplay and 50’s cartoon style of it. The music is great and it’s just overall so good. One of the first games I remember beating and feeling so good because of how hard it was.. This beautifully put together games continues to be perfect after all these years. It somehow perfectly balances the difficulty, not too difficult, not too hard. Anyone who’s trying to leave a bad review because they can’t beat something in the game, keep trying, you’ll get it.. Great artwork and music. But the gameplay consists of hard, relatively long levels without any checkpoints. In practice, this means that you repeat the same level dozen of times, usually needing a couple of minutes until you reach the point you previously reached, only to progress a little bit more.This type of gameplay is unfun and frustrating to me. I dislike it so much, that a rating of 3 may even be high. But the art and music does some work in me appreciating the game.. So perfect and special! I love this game! Its so fun! Its amazing! Yes! Nothing to complain ig. art and music is amazing, gameplay is clean, character design is wonderful. there was so much love put into this game its so clear. Another challanging game I surprisingly enjoyed. The artstyle is so unique and the music is just peak. Obviously the boss battles are great and I'm already excited to play the dlc.. very perfect!. this game is a masterpiece, its my number one game of all time, play it.. I made a metacritic account to give this what is deserve. Easily one of the best run and guns that exists Pros: - The boss fights are well designed. - The difficulty suitably matches the zones with a few exceptions which isn't necessarily bad as it sets the challenge of the game. - The difficulty is mostly organic and nothing that ails the player occurs because of poor game design. -Artistically phenomenal, perfect animations, sound effects and uniqueness. Cons: - The normal levels are actually the weakest part of the game. I find the level design to be subpar compared to the bosses.. a fantastic old school run and gun where trial and error is fun, gives you a real sense of progress and it is never frustrating. Amazing art style and great music. That's basically a perfect game.. the best platform of all times for sure a must have, incredible game and artistic dorection. One of the best games I ever played. The bosses (except the final boss I defeated him in my 2nd try) are pretty difficult, but not too hard for the moment you fight them in, except the FRICKING DRAGON HE IS SO HARD, which means the game is not as hard as like GD or Getting Over It, but still challenging. The soundtrack is even better - search it up on Spotify and you will think the exact same. The best soundtracks IMO are Floral Fury, Murine Corps, Carnival Kerfuffle and One Hell at A Time. I highly recommend.. A bit to short but omg what a game. Vinted art style plus pov making me fell like old good times. Its challanging so i love it even more. Totaly to complite everything max 20h depends from skill. But its one of this games that you need to play.. this is and and always will be my favorite game ever made. The 1930's cartoon vibe is wonderful and the characters are all fun to watch. The boss fights are top notch to but be warned this game is tough and if you want a more chill game for younger kids then you should probably just play Kirby. With that said the feeling you get when you beat a boss is amazing please buy this game it's worth every penny you pay. and stop saying this game **** because it's hard difficulty doesn't make a game bad.. Cuphead is a relentless game. It's a lot of other things too, but it's main thing is that it is relentless with the player. Make the slightest mistake and you will pay. Again. And again. And again. This approach by the devs is intentional. It is very obvious that the game was designed with this philosophy. Now here's the thing. Someone can be relentless to you if they so wish, but then you have to be relentless to them too. If someone expects excellence, then excellence should be expected from them . I'll take one point off for the tiny bit of lag when you press pause-down-A to restart. Another point off because the spinning move can't be done directly after jumping. Another point off cause the spinning move has the tiniest bit of lag. I'll take another point off for some weapons descriptions not being accurate. I'll take another point off cause the final bosses don't have an easy mode. 5/10. Pros: - Gorgeous hand-drawn artstyle - Soundtrack - Bosses are difficult, but fair - A lot of collectibles keep the game fresh - A lot of re-playability - Controls are incredibly responsive and tight - Multiplayer compatability - Bosses are well designed and full of character Cons: - Can sometimes be repetitive when attempting bosses repeatedly. Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s more rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of course influenced by my personal opinions. (8) Very Good. Innovated, but perhaps not in the right choice for everyone. This score indicates that there are many good things to be had, but arguable so. The wonderful art design, nod to classic cartoons and smooth controls are what stand out in this game. The only thing about this game that will drive some folks away is that it’s hard to master. Boss battles are just precious artwork and well-designed that should be appreciated to all that play. If you play it on the easier difficulty, you’ll be missing out on the boss battles because you won’t be able to see them transform for the second stage.. Cuphead has brought back the old school challenges of playing a game. Very difficult, and keeps you entertained and coming back for more! The art style is just one of a kind, and a pleasure to see. The very unique ideas behind the boss battles and feel of classic cartoons is just amazing. A must play for anyone who enjoyed the difficulty of playing games in the 90’s.. Great, great expansion!!! Please, more! I did 100% and still not enough. This game is Perfect!. A perfect game.amazing visuals, character design, gameplay, and music made this one of my all time favorite games.each isle got better and better with better bosses and even better difficulty.I just went back to this game for the dlc and after I beat that I decided to replay the whole game on expert and within a week I have only just now beaten the first aka the most easy isle meaning I have a lot to look forward to in the next 2 isles.I’m not going to talk about the dlc because I want to give a different review for that even though the dlc is more or less the same.. Perfect game with astonishing aesthetic. Me and my friend had a lot fun while beating em. I love the charm of this game. It has jazz, it has a really nice animated look, and a good game to back it up.. Absolutely wonderful, i love the animations and the character design, i've already passed the game in expert mode and I'ts one of my favourite games. Extremely challenging but extremely funny as well. Unique graphics, awesome. The game is great and everyone has given it all the praise it can get. BUT BE WARNED! This game is brutally difficult and if you don't have the patience to develop skills, you're gonna have a bad time.. Great game in a beautiful cartoon style from the 30s. The game has excellent and varied bosses, a good soundtrack, interesting characters, levels. One of the best platform games ever.. I can easily see why people would like this game. It's colorful, stylish, and unique. But it's for a certain type of gamer. I'm not that type of gamer. Because of it's difficulty and repetition, it puts itself in a class that isn't interesting to me. But more than just my tastes, the game does have additional flaws. 1) You can't turn in your upgrades (even at a reduced price) to get/try something else. You could argue that this makes the game even more difficult, but I'd rather they increase the difficulty in a less aggravating way to locking you into an upgrade. 2) You can only go so far on simple mode, which isn't made clear at the beginning of the game. Thus, you might play through on simple for the story only to find out that won't get you to the ending. 3) Some bosses/boss parts can be easily defeated standing in a certain spot and/or doing a certain move, which you can grind to find out or watch YouTube. But to be fair, that's true for a lot of games. 4) When playing two players it can be hard to distinguish between you and your friend. I think Cuphead and Mugman should've been a little more unique from one another. 5) Should've had a kid mode so that not only could kids play this game, but casual adults too. Anyway, I prefer games with simple story mode or some online action. This game kept my interest for a night or two, but the aforementioned flaws and repetition was not my thing. If you're like me, this isn't the game for you.. Really couldn’t get into it, just felt too painful and unforgiving. However, that probably just comes down to preference of game style and thus I couldn’t fairy give it a negative score. The art style is also brilliant and should be reused in future games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Sometimes you need a rate a game based on it doing what it set out to do. This is an excellent challenging platformer/shooter! Every frame is a work of art!. This game is awesome. The controls are great, the graphics are splendid and the game play is fun as hell. Prepare to die a ton, though. No punches are pulled here. Oh and the music is addictive.. Real dificult but also Real satisfying when you are a le to defeat all the bosses and complete the game. It has also a great enviroment.. EN: It looks like Disney cartoons a long time ago. Art style is unique in the gaming world. Very nice music, interesting missions, but extremely difficult game. After playing for a long time, the game becomes extremely irritating due to its difficulty. SRB: Izgleda kao Disney crtaći nekada davno. Art stil je unikatan u gaming svetu. Veoma lepa muzika, zanimljive misije, ali izuzetno teška igra. Posle dužeg igranja igra postane izuzetno iritantna zbog svoje težine.. A game that packs an amazingly satisfying challenge to overcome along with an amazing art style that's expressed perfectly well through its breathtaking hand-done animation. Also has a banging soundtrack.. I like this game. The whole old school animation style of the game makes it very unique compared to other games. Lots of cool and funny looking characters, a very creative hub world, and lots of cool Easter eggs and references to find. However, there is one massive problem with this game. ITS VERY HARD. Cuphead is one of the most difficult and challenging video games I have ever played. You'd think the game would give a slight edge but... It doesn't. It just constantly throws everything it has at you. All the time. If you play a boss on the easy difficulty, the game won't progress. You are required to play on the regular difficulty if you want to progress the main storyline. Which I think is a pretty trash mechanic in any video game. The developers should at least not require you to play on a harder difficulty to progress the game. A crucial thing to have in a game is difficulty selection that doesn't effect the progression of the game at all. Thank goodness that the game doesn't require lives. Now that would be awful. So I give Cuphead and 8. I do like it, but the difficulty distorts the cool and creative Ideas.. I Don't like the souls game but this game is good. Yeah maybe little too hard however this doesn't take away from value. Art Direction is Amazing. a game like no other with amazing visuals with fair, fun,challenging, gameplay but the game can get unfair at times.. Cuphead appears to be a simple game, that is, until you actually play it. Cuphead is fun, while also being difficult at the same time.. A piece of art. Simple, beautiful, effective. Be aware such a difficult game is not for everyone.. I like hard games and especially when its about hard boss fights and fun boss fights. So this probably makes you think I like dark souls but dark souls has one problem for me and also its the reason I stopped playing it. this problem is the fact that if you die by a boss you have to walk 5 minutes again after a loading screen to just die again. This just frustrates me as it is literally wasting my time. But this just confirms why I love cuphead so much because with just simply hitting one button on your controller after dying you can retry the boss immediatly. This is amazing and just lets me try a boss over and over again until I get the knockout. For me this just makes me wonder why doesnt darksouls put the respawns closer and why should it be a punish to die as it is just learning the game they made. But okay enough about dark souls. the combat in cuphead is good its most of the time just manufuring around the screen and shooting if you get the chance or just let loose of bullet hell to get as much damage in. The bosses are pretty hard and it took me about 200 deaths to finish the game. The only thing I really hated where the flying levels. This is the same with mario or any other 2d platform games with swimming levels. seriously nobody likes that its tedious! but besides that this game is amazing! artstyle and graphics wise you know it looks good! I really recommend this game to everyone that likes a challenge!. One of the most impressive art styles in a game I have ever seen. The gameplay is challenging yet addicting, and the feeling you get when you finally beat a boss is amazing. One of the greatest OSTs in gaming as well.. Not for the weak of heart! Can seem unfair at times (well a lot) but that usually goes for all platformers. Beautiful and original game design. The tightest gameplay in any game I’ve played. Very difficult, but not punishing (as in you don’t lose a lot of progress for dying). Levels seem impossible at first, but you naturally get a little better each time until that run where you just barely **** by with a win. It’s an absolute blast. And the art, animation and music make this the most stylish game I’ve ever played.. Very difficult but the art style with the soundtrack is top class and fits it well.. Incredible game a reminder of what games where on super Nintendo, hard to play but greatly rewarding! GIT GUD an be a man!. Unique, hardcore, beautiful Artistic design like (old cartoons of 80's)... Soundtracks and sound effects are incredible. The developers just deserve so much love Because they did a masterpiece in Cuphead.. Please take your time and be patience (you will need it), this is not made it for everyone and i mean that. Cuphead is one the best Xbox One games in this generation because of innovation and distinctive gameplay. Thank you Guys of MDHR. Cuphead is a boss rush and run and gun game where the two types of levels which both have a random element to them that can be a little unfair at times. The game is hard and you will have to redo levels a number of times but that just makes it more satisfying when you do finally beat them. It is a really solid game that deserves a play from anyone who likes any type of game and if you can get past the frustration of loosing then you will get the major satisfaction of winning.. This is truly an outstanding, magical piece of art made into a game. The graphics are beautiful, and look like a cartoon in the 1950's, but with color, and in a beautiful way. The gameplay is smooth, and the game is extremely difficult, with creative, yet awesome bosses, and a solid storyline, that is rather short. The soundtrack is catchy, and jazzy, and got me dancing while fighting bosses. The only con is that the game is almost too difficult. At times, I got stuck, and that was frustrating, saving me from giving this game a perfect score. Overall, it is one hell of a time! (slow clap). Incredibly stunning game. Difficult as devil and it's original soundtrack it's the ultimate. I only gave this an 8 because it is so damn difficult!! Amazing “Steamboat Willy” esque art throwback style to classic animation. My friends won’t play this with me because it stresses them the hell out. Possibly harder than the old Contra games. Still if you’re up for a challenge, this is a great game if you’re up to deal with the devilish difficulty.. This may just be my opinion, but cuphead is an amazing game. The music is amazing and you really get the old timey vibe by just playing it for a few minutes. Its a nice challenge and a fun game to speedrun.. Absolutely brilliant game ! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a compelling story and strategic gameplay elements.. From the moment I first saw Cuphead a couple of years ago I was instantly hooked, and to say I was looking forward to it would be a huge understatement.. This game is so fun and frustrating at the same time! I loved **** was one of my best experiences in gaming and i recommend that y’all buy it,’cause you won’t regret it.I spent a lot of hours in CupHead trying to beat the same boss but i manage to finished it and what can i say? This game is so beautiful and i loved the cartoon graphics! 100% worth playing. This was very fun tight gameplay, amazing soundtrack, and fun bosses. The only thing holding this game back was some of the fun and gun stages.. I definitely recommend picking up this game. It’s a great 2d platformer and a blast to play. Although it’s pretty difficult, anybody with a Xbox, Switch, or PC should pick up Cuphead.. Where do I begin, this was one hell **** and i highly recommend this game for people looking for a challenge. But this challenge will more than likely make you pissed off. Although the game is so amazing that you can’t stay away from it for a long period of time. I beat this game awhile ago but I will visit this game all the time.. This Game is failed for many level. - Character are Uncreative - Not even fun at all. - Main Characters are useless plot, personally and Non-Animal Type - Cheap Rip off Change my mind Studio MDHR shouldn't make another game that from the 1930's. Indie Gamer Company want to milking more and more and hurting their fanbase Cuphead and Bendy were created as Both Company is highly backslash to the old Cartoon. That they do they made too many crossover, Ocs, Shipping that highly annoying and ruining for me. There many game better then this.. Cuphead is really such Overrated Games. It not worth it for a story, Gameplays, character at all. Not recommended We don't just hate the game, all it matter is another Indie Game like FNAF, Undertales BATIM all over again. Old Cartoon was start to Lose popularly because of this Both Cuphead and BATIM Steal the show. What they keep going to adding and adding and more Attention it never stop those game, This need to stop! If there the new characters come out then the fandom will get bomb every new character that only Inspired by the cartoons of the 1930's Seriously were the other boy? Old Toons are goner and passed away. This a full of army of little kid-teen playing this game and ruined the old Cartoon Communities Really Cuphead? What was Studio MDHR Thinking? Since after 2 days later is already Most controversial outside the Internet. The New toons is just Disgusting, Horrible fanbase, cancerous fandom, Ocs, Too many Crossover, Fan Game, Rule 34, Younger Kids and the rest. Our Childhood are been ruined by mostly Indie game Fandom. most of the fandom are evil, why they doing this, they not iconic enough to like them. What a big duel of Indie game from of the first place Amino can tell how many people are there with any franchise such as Cartoon Characters, Video Game Character, Anime and other thing like that. Just avoid the popular Indie game it killed you and it make the other fan unhappy.. A Terrible chose creating this game for first that Inspired by the cartoons of the 1930s. Say I Disagree with this game. We had Sonic, Animanics, BATIM and Now Cuphead. all them mostly been used to the Classic Cartoon to give them pouplar and newer to the fan To milking the Franchise and Fandom. This game is just not that good. i say not recommended that stay away.. Old Cartoon was Awesome but the new toons is kinda ruined for everyone. -Weak character -Too Overrated -No Plot, No Depevoment -Bad Characters -The Story **** -Fandom (Indie Game) -Insulted to the Classic Cartoon Not Recommended. Too Hard, Awful Characters, not fan to play. No plot, Development at all. That Terrible copy paste to old Cartoon. The Indie Fandom is Disgusting alone side of BATIM.. A truly fantastic indie game. The animation gives me huge 50's vibes. The music is also amazing. The bosses are also really creative, challenging, and a blast to fight.. Gameplay/Mechanics: 8 Sound/Music: 9 Graphics/Art: 10 Story/Atmosphere: 8 OVERALL: 8.8/10. Buy this game if you love plat formers or old school cartoons. I found this game hard and even frustrating at times, but I never thought the game was unfair. Everytime I died, I knew it was my fault. That is why this game is great. Story:6 Style:10 Characters:10 Gameplay:10 Mechanics:8 Sounds:10 Boss fights:10. All in all I am struggling to find any real bad points to this game, everything about it brings a smile to my face. From the Hanna-Barbera style look, to the simply perfect soundtrack. Add to this the incredibly challenging yet rewarding game play and you have a perfect game. This is a work of passion, each character was hand drawn and all of the levels and environments were brought to life using watercolours. Studio MDHR and all of the Moldenhauer family, you have my eternal thanks for Cuphead, it is perfect.. The graphical and musical quality for this game is outstanding. The art direction for this game. This game is a masterpiece in new enthusiastic design and art style in a game. The 1930's appeal to this visual appealing and is a great style for new further indie games to come for smaller game designers. And lets not forget about the pure torture and difficulty spike that this game throws at you within the first 30-40 minutes of playing the game after the tutorial. This game is amazing. The graphics truly make this game look like it’s a classic cartoon. The music is also very old sounding, which adds some more charm to this game. The story I think is fun and new, I haven’t played or seen a story like this before. The gameplay is pretty hard, but the challenge is good. The boss fights usually require you to figure out how the best way to play the battle is. I recommend this game to anyone who like platformers, challenge, or cartoons.. Very difficult. High rewarding. Love the soundtrack and the art! Very nice effort.. You know how a joke can start funny, get annoying, then become funny again through sheer attrition? That’s Cuphead’s approach to enjoyment. With a beautiful, caustic, near-unceasing stream of boss battles, Studio MDHR’s debut made me scream with joy and horror by turn, but I settled on joy by the end. The most obvious point to begin with is that Cuphead looks astonishing. Its 1930s animation style – all watercolour backgrounds and surreal, juddering, hand-drawn characters – pay peerless homage to Max Fleischer and his ilk, and are perfectly implemented. Somehow it manages to balance dozens of moving elements and a slight rear-projection blur without ever feeling unreadable in even the most frantic moments. There has never been a game that looks like this and there may never be again. Every scene is a masterwork – it’s a near-unbelievable achievement for an art style. The sound work is an ideal match: a huge jumble of high-tempo ragtime, swing, big band, and jazz (the list of musicians is almost as long as the rest of the credits combined) pummels away wonderfully in the background of every fight. It makes Cuphead feel truly out of time, and its bizarre mix of ‘30s aesthetics and ‘80s design more heady than ever. I also feel duty-bound to point out that the way Porkrind the shopkeeper bellows “welcome” made me laugh every single time I heard it. The Music of Cuphead: Recording Floral Fury share 1:29 There’s no doubt that it’s gorgeous, and many people will be drawn to that, but that veneer conceals a very niche, hardcore design. You may have gleaned by now that this game is really, really hard. It’s absolutely uncompromising in its difficulty from the outset. No level includes checkpoints and, barring one late-game match-up, there is no way to regain lost health. You could hit levels that take hours to beat, and the finale is locked off until you beat every other level on “Regular” difficulty (i.e. extremely difficult). And don’t think that local co-op will ease things up – dropping in a second player as Cuphead’s pal Mugman makes events onscreen that much harder to follow. I find it actively harder with a second player, if anything. And so, as I played I gradually stopped noticing a lot of the glorious art, because actually interacting","this game is just incredible, it has a style that I've never seen any other game even attempt . the music is so good and actually goes with the flow of the game . if your considering getting Cuphead, just buy it, its an absolute 2017 classic ."
876.Velocity 2X,"I only played as long as I did because everyone was saying how good it was and I wanted to give it a fighting chance.. This game is a very enjoyable ride. It truly feels like an arcade, hard and frenetic. To get the platinum you have to do everything perfectly. some of the levels took me hours, but it feels very rewarding when you get to the point that you know the levels by heart and can complete almost by muscle memory alone... only been playing for a few hours but really fun shooter/platformer Cool character and art design reminds me of so many snes games.. The game is a shooter moving screen game, high score chasing deal. If you enjoy collecting things to move forward to the next level this might be something for you, otherwise the game controllers are fine, and the plot is fine, but the tedious collection system that makes you advance really kills it.. A fast paced mix of top down shooter and side scrolling platformer Velocity 2x is an entertaining little title that you can play as a straight action game or spend time relentlessly chasing high scores. As with many games of this ilk it is actually more fun on the early levels, seeing as they are shorter and more conducive to being played over and over in an attempt to improve your performance, but with concepts being added constantly throughout the 50 missions on offer it never outstays its welcome and is certainly a title I’ll be keeping on my hard drive.. Best game that I have gotten from the PlayStation Plus subscription. The mix of space shooter and sidescroller is truly unique. While fun the game got repetitive and levels got long towards the end.. Fast but not fun!!! The game is super repetitive, with missions that are not enjoyable. I just do t know why critic reviews gave favoravle reviews on this.. Velocity 2X is pretty good with his two game modes. The music is good but the gameplay is too repetitive. Graphics 6/10 Music 7/10 Gameplay 5/10 My overall score is 6. This game was OK, but after a few hours I just couldn't get into it and was distracted by other things pretty easily. One pro is it seemed to be generally easy to beat a level, but much more difficult to 100% it, so for non completionists like myself I don't think it would eat up a ton of time to ""finish"" this game. Velocity 2X is a top down shoot em up and sci-fi plat-former that is a sequel that expands the experience from the first game, Velocity Ultra. The nice little story continues right from where the first game left off were main character lieutenant Kai Tena was left nearly dead. She is captured along with her ship by an alien race called the Vokh for experimentation so they could figure out the technology behind her teleporting ship. Thankfully Kai Tena manages to escape with the help of an alien prisoner, and in return she agrees to save the alien slave race while finding a way back home. The story is told in a well made colorful art style with small expressions that helps give the characters, especially Kai, a likable personality that was absent from the first game. The blend between shoot em up and plat former is cleverly done and you will receive tutorials at the beginning of each new mechanic. On the Jet, you will fly though vertical levels, destroy enemies, avoid obstacles, fight well designed bosses and rescue stranded allied ships by disabling the shields. There is a new tele-port mechanic that allows you to pass through walls and transforms you from jet to platform and vice versa to solve puzzles As a plat former, the controls will be similar to that of the Jet. You will move left and right through buildings on alien planets. You will be collecting pink gems, teleporting through barriers, skidding, boosting and firing 360 degrees with the canon.There are 50 main missions that are fun and challenging. The levels become harder and larger with various paths and puzzles and you will need to gain experience points to advance to later levels by replaying some stages again. Replaying each stage after you finish the game for the perfect score by completing the level fast, killing all enemies and collecting gems quickly without dying is addicting and rewarding. Velocity 2X has good music that is suited for the fast paced game play. It is a well rounded action packed shooter with high replay value. It is a cross-buy between the vita and the PS4; however, it felt more at home with the Vita. Even though the ending could have been better, Velocity 2X is worth your time and an experience that you will enjoy.. I honestly cannot understand a hype around this game. It is a very, very simplistic game. It's neither a competent scroll-shooter, nor a worthy puzzler. The side-scrolling ""runner"" sections are laughable. Please behold a classic ""hype-train"" situation, when one lazy reviewer starts a tendency and the sheep follow. This isn't the BEST PS4 game. By no means. It is ridiculous to rate it over Destiny, Killzone, Alien Isolation or Middle-Earth. Get down on the Earth, people. You just ruin the competent top-lists with such ridiculous scoring.. Boring and repetitive. Non-challenging at least not in an interesting way. Meaningless story/interludes. I do like 2D platformers and shoot-em-ups, but this is just uninteresting. Got it for free with PS+, but will never play again. Real score 5,. but gets 0 to balance out the unrealistic scores from magazines and FuturLab employees.. I apologize for any mistakes, I'm french and my English is far from perfect. I played this game thanks to the PS+ subscription but I'll be reviewing it like if i paid its full price as it is no longer free to download. First of all, like in almost every game of this genre, don't expect a great story-telling, it is only some lines of texts at the beginning of every level. The gameplay is very good with easy transitions between spaceship and running phases it differentiates itself from others shoot'em up thanks to its almost constant need for teleportation that evokes classic puzzle games and a more tactic action. With more than 50 levels, a good replay value if you want to ""perfect"" every level, correct designs and nice music, Velocity doesn't have any major defaults and it is a great game to pass the time but i didn't find it unforgettable and i don't think it will stay in the memories of the gamers for many years. That's why I give it a 8.. Don't listen to the haters who have been dogging this game. It is an amazing blend of top-down shooter, side scrolling platformer and puzzle genres. I hadn't heard of this game at all until Sony put it up as a free download for Playstation Plus. I got it on my PS4 and my Vita and cannot stop playing it. It's an extremely addictive, slickly-designed game which I would highly recommend to anyone.. Okay, wouldn't buy otherwise without Playstation Plus, but for a free fun arcade shooter its average. I found level design is similar from what I've played so far as well.. This game looks and plays like it belongs on a Super Nintendo. From 1990. If I played this on my iphone, I might think it was ok. But how can anyone rate this game 9 or 10 as a PS4 next gen game???!!! Just Ridiculous!. First you get the impression the tutorials will never end, then you fell you do not learn anything useful. The game is so simple it feels cheap even for free with PSN+. It's not a good shooter neither a good plataformer.. Simple addicting fun. It's like r-type and metroid had a baby 5 console generations later. The game could have used a little more direct combat with quality AI though. I was hoping for something on-par with einhander, but after 17 years it still hasn't happened.. You know what? This game isn't necessarily bad. It's a functionally great game with a unique concept that you don't see as often nowadays, and really does have a good game mechanically. But this game is just so boring... So, I'm a kid who was raised on space shooters like Galaga and Bosconian, so this review may have a bit of bias in it. But all this game does is have you collect ""survivors"" by flying up to them. That's the point of the game. And for about the first 6 or 7 levels I was telling myself ""Okay, this is all tutorial stuff, I'm sure the actual game will heat up soon enough!"" So I kept playing on. But nope. Collecting this games equivalent to coins. And it's too easy! Once you get the mechanics figured out, it's not a hard game. Half the time I would buzz through the level with Silver, 3 stripes, and 3 stars. At one point I just got bored of the levels I was in, and thanks to all the XP I got I could jump 10 levels ahead (which, by the way the game requires you to earn a certain XP before going to other levels, but since the game's too easy I got so much XP playing a couple levels I could usually jump more levels up). And you know what? It was still boring! BUT WAIT! There's a section where you play as a human and run around! This time, you'll be collecting crystals! Aren't you just so lucky???? And all that does is break up the bits of gameplay that are actually good. It feels like two completely different game-sets, where either one could've done fine on its own without the other. But going from moving in all directions to a Metroid-vania style just feels weird, and later down the line they decide it's a good idea to put multiple breaks in the flying to have these sections. And finally, the one hit kills in this game are bad. In a game like Galaga or Space Invaders, the developers can get away with one hit kills because you know what you're up against and you can see what's shooting you. But this game can't get away with that. See, because enemies are such a scarcity, sometimes you'll just be rushing through the level and all of the sudden you'll just die. Enemy placement is very cheap, purposefully trying to be out of sight or just barely out of the shot until you move a little to the left and get blown up. I felt robbed on those occasions because there's no way of knowing when those come, and unlike something like Castlevania where you're always on your toes, this game you let your guard down because you might spend whole levels not even being shot at once. Or, the few enemies you do get to fight are turrets stuck in one place, and they just shoot at you. But their bullets are one hit KO's. So the game designers set 2 near a wall and spam you with bombs! This is a game that wants you to go fast but punishes you for doing so. It puts me on a timer but forces me multiple times to go backwards in the level because of portals (yeah, the game uses portals and forces you to backtrack throughout certain areas up to 3 times!). It gives you all this freedom of movement and shooting but forces you to switch into Running mode. Again, the game works, but I find it to be a very boring experience. Even though it's free for PS Plus, I find it to be a very dull experience nonetheless. I still prefer the older games to this. You should still download this for free if you have PS Plus to see if you like it, but it's not something I liked.. Nice free game, but not worth the score it currently have. Game contain two modes, the typical shmup and the platforming and they mix them in levels. It is fluid and well tweaked. Graphics could be much better for a PS4 title. I love the concept of obtaining all objectives on all levels independently, but it becomes quasi-impossible and very frustrating to obtain the perfect scores (especially the time limit aspect). I don't understand complaints about tutorial or hand holding, that's what the game does perfectly. A quick intro that can be completed in minutes and then the challenge start.. I had a great time playing this game. I only wish it were longer. If there is ever an expansion pack with more levels I am definitely getting it. The controls are pretty easy to pick up and you can get through all the levels without too much difficulty given the infinite respawns. But if you want to take a shot at the leader board you better bring your A game. Getting a perfect badge on a level is very satisfying and I am working on them all. Really gives another layer of depth after you finish the campaign.. Fantastic, beautiful and satisfying. A really fun shooter with top down space shooting elements interspersed with dynamic platforming sections. The music is also really catchy, crossing old school arcade tunes with a more upbeat vibe.. I received the first Velocity on my Vita as part of my PS+ membership program and I didn't pay much attention to it. It looked like a cool space shooter with a gimick - nothing more, nothing less, so I didn't even play all of it. When I heard that this month they were going to give us Velocity 2X free, I felt that I should go back and revisit the first game (to be able to competently compare the two, at least). When I took a closer look to Velocity Ultra, I found a very well thought out game with challenging gameplay and puzzles that is made with a lot of love. And with awesome minigames. I was on board and set for Velocity 2X and, with no surprise, I found a awesome upgrade to a very cool game. Velocity 2X retains the core gameplay experience, but it adds more and more to the mix. Ultimately, that makes Velocity 2X the better game - it sounds better (though some tracks from the original OST are missed), it looks much nicer and it has a lot more story this time around. Overall - it feels more like a full-fledged game, rather than a mini space-shooter. The shooting portion of the game remains largely untouched. On account of the graphical differences, you will have to get use to controlling the ship - there are some very subtle differences, but nothing that breaks the experience. I have just one problem with this, and it is the same one I had with the first one - they should have put a limit to the bombs that you can fire with the R stick. They are too powerful, and if you are smart, you will end up using them more than your main gun throughout your adventure - it makes the game too easy. Sure, you can not use then if you want to, but it kind of feels like cheating both ways The radical difference when it comes to gameplay is that now you have platforming sections in which you control Kai, the pilot of the ship. These are very fun and very well made, however they have one huge problem: they sometimes go against the overall theme of the game. The game is, often times, all about doing everything you can in the least possible amount of time - that is what drives the player to become better and better at the game, that's the core addiction factor. However, in the platforming sections, once you get your weapons, you cannot run/walk and shoot at the same time, which results in the player stopping to accomplish certain goals - like collecting crystals, or destroying parts of the overall puzzle, or even defeating enemies. This is all happening while you are rushing against the clock to get a better rank and score. Ergo - this is a inner conflict that is very annoying. I feel that it could have been easily fixed by having simply one gun and it being auto-aim, and being usable while running. This, however, does not ruin the overall fun factor of being able to run, grind and jump very fast - these segments, while annoying at the aforementioned particular times, are a extremely welcomed brake to the usual space shooting. The story, as I mentioned, is also bigger in this sequel. Every level has at least one (be that, unanimated) slide of art and a few lines of dialogue. Sometimes - this is enough to push you forward, the story is driving, while not particularly innovative. It is conveyed with love, a very vibrant art style, and it offers lots of minor details in the Ship Computer for fans to read further - like info on friends and foes. The Ship Computer - one of the best addictions in the original - has gotten an upgrade too, and it's bigger and better than ever. I won't spoil anything, however. And in total, this is all - Velocity 2X is simply bigger and better than the original. It has it's flaws, but it's a awesome upgrade to a awesome game. If you liked the first one - you are going to like this one. If you didn't like the original - still give this one a shot, it has a much more rounded feel and might just be the thing for you. Personally, I appreciate all the work that has gone into this game, and that is enough for me to give my recommendation.. Good game. Game mechanic, level design - i liked it, but what i didn't like is that the game didn't allow me to start a new level (41 or 42) because i didn't get enough experience points on previous levels, and besides i did them not so bad, the first ones are even perfect completed but even this is not enough for this game. It seems like it wants you to complete every level's challenge with 3 stars, which i think is pretty hard and you must waste a lot of your time just to pass the same levels over and over again unless you get enough exp. points to start a new one. Why can't i just complete the game without all these difficulties. But i'll repeat - the gameplay is very good and fun. But these exp. points.. Ugh... This game,This game.Holy moly,this game's insanely good!It's challenging and highly **** story was surprisingly good and the gameplay is smoth,top notch,not to mention gorgeous!. Great game, fun gameplay, exciting visuals, i just love the game's music, my favourite game music of the year alongside Hotline Miami, Highly recommended. :). Extremely generic, even for the price of nothing this game managed to bore me after 15 minutes. Bland art style and repetitive gameplay. I'm baffled by the overwhelming praise this is getting from critics, if it wasn't an indie game I would be suspicious of cash handouts. Overall it isn't a terrible game but it isn't worthy of a near 90 metascore, completely forgettable.. This game is very fun, the game mechanics feel great. My main issue is that the level design is too easy. The game is very fast paced but i would like it to have a higher difficulty from the beginning. Velocity 2X a unique if rather unimpressive mixture of a top-down shooter with a 2D side-scroller. To be brief on the subject everything functions competently and the top-down portions from time to time gave a brief impression of Ikaruga with a minor dash of Galaga throw for added measure. The side-scrolling segments provide a semblance of Sonic as well. After that however the game boils down to a slew of levels that have a bad habit of melting into one another. As of this point I have played through 22 of the 50 on-hand missions available from the outset and the only response that I am able to muster is ""Meh"". There isn't particularly anything wrong with Velocity 2X it’s a game that is just lacking in ideas and creativity. Fact of the matter is that Velocity 2X runs out of ideas in the early levels and from there things just appear to be stuck on repeat for the remainder of the play time. It doesn't take to long for you to start feeling deja vu until that turns into monotony as it feels like your darting through a nearly identical gauntlet each and every time with only a cosmetic change to accompany the new levels. The game follows Lt. Kai Tana a pilot who was sent on a mission to disrupt a black hole that threatened Earth with her newly designed ship. Things as expected go sideways and Kai ends up horribly maimed and in the clutches of an alien race that seeks to use her for their own plans and restore her with cybernetics. After revival she with the help of the alien Ralan escapes the facility with her ship and proceeds to mount a rebellion against her captures. While their being some more finer details to the narrative the story remains as simple as it arrives. It's rather boring really as every action in the story is punctuated by a level so that you experience the thrilling events through another predicable level. Rinse, wash, and repeat. There may be twist down the line meant to shake things up but, I have doubts that it would arrive out of nowhere or be telegraphed so hard that it wouldn't even deserved to be called a twist. So needless to say the story isn't breaking any new ground but, then again it is passable at the very least. Before we move on I should say that everything is told to you through text bubbles and slide show panels that have been well drawn. Now for the audio accompaniment, it's there, is about all I can say towards it. I mean yes there is sound but, the vast majority of it is by the numbers. Lasers sound like lasers, explosions sound like explosions, that’s really all there is. Actually this is really unfair of me degrading the sound when what really gets my goat is this wretched cyberwave soundtrack someone dredged up from the cellar to torment my ear drums. It's not like I dislike cyberwave either, for the most part I'm indifferent on the fact. While there clearly is a varied, and I use that word loosely, amount of tracks the difference in them can be so minute at times it comes off barely noticeable. Seriously, while playing I could have sworn that there was one track and it was on a continuous loop. The repetitive gameplay didn't lessen this fact what so ever. One might say that you could very well excuse various short comings **** if the gameplay is up to snuff and can carry the experience. That is not the case with Velocity 2X which allow me to say doesn't make it bad. Doesn't make it good either but, you know not bad. The real addition it brings to the table of gameplay mechanics is the ability to teleport in both forms of play. Whether it’s to bypass an obstacle, jump back to a set point or to access areas beyond your reach the teleporting aspect is the primary concept in which this entire game was designed. The vast majority of the time you will be stopped by a wall and need to quickly teleport before the vertical screen encompasses you. Pretty much between the two differing play styles you'll be met with nothing more than some arbitrary hindrance impeding your progress and disrupting your flow. Even when enemies are introduced the most they do is stay stationary and shoot you, fly in circling formation, or patrol in a fashion that allows you simply bypass them completely. The game offers you additional weapons and abilities throughout but, these are on offer only due to the fact that the developers wanted to switch up placements of things. You get a rifle fairly early on to replace your staring arm cannon but, it's pointless to use since it can only fire left and right while your arm cannon can fire in 360 degrees. This amplified by the fact that most things in need of shooting are typically above, below, or at an angle. All-in-all is Velocity 2X, with all things stated, worth the $20 asking price? In my opinion, no not really. The game seems short and doesn't offer the player much incentive to return for more. Only ardent fans of classic shooters like Xevious and alike might take interest but, with Destiny a week away there isn't much reason to not wait.. Exceptional indie game that every Vita owner should get. It's just overflown with quality - visual, music and fun and fast gameplay. Very recommended.. A well rounded, well designed shooter/platformer. It seamlessly integrates the mechanics in a way that encourages you to perfect your gameplay. The reviewer accusing the game if ""hand holding"" obviously hasn't played very far in to the game. It only explains things the first time you encounter a new mechanic. I don't know what they expect, it's pretty stupid not to expect a game to have some kind of tutorial. The art is great, the music is perfect and it's just an all around great game. Plus it's free if you have PS+. Anyone giving negative reviews just doesn't get good gaming.. Velocity suffers greatly form Hand-Holding syndrome. when you get a new ability, it tell you what it does, how to use it, and when to use it. To the point that the use of many abilities seems forced and not at all fun to use. There is almost no independent thinking. The game is constantly auto-pausing to tell you how to deal with a new obstacle instead of trying to let you figure it out. the saving graces are its clean art style, and great chill cyber wave music.. A treat for the hardcore gamer, maybe less so for the casuals. This is the kind of game you need to play in a certain way (in other words properly) to truly appreciate. Going for high scores makes you appreciate the game design / mechanics even more. Having said all that, the game is currently free on ps4 so the least you can do is try it and see for yourself. Nothing to lose...maybe a new favorite game to gain.. Hands down my favorite sci-fi shooter game of the past few years! Extremely fast-paced, never a boring minute, and challenging too! The controls flow surprisingly well and the game itself just feels polished. Get PS+ and you get this game for free, so no reason to not at least try it!. This game has it's Great music, interesting story, levels, collectables, high replay value, and mechanics. The first few levels are slow to try understanding the mechanics, since afterwards things are going to get more intense, which feels so great getting through it at max speed, collecting, and destroying everything to get that perfect score. I'm not kidding, even if it sounds to good to be true. I just don't see anything broken or out of place with this game. If you got plus then I recommend you to try this game out. If you don't then do since it's 20$ which seems crazy, yet it will take a lot of time to complete which in my case would be worth it.. Another side scrolling mobile game with a terrible story and boring gameplay. I can't even understand how anyone can rate this 9/10! After 2 hours it's blatant that this isn't even a game it's ""angry birds""! It would also be nice if Sony didn't force me to buy PS+ so I could skip the bad months like this one!. No clue where hb1209 is coming from. PS Plus is better than it has ever been. Not sure what game selection has to do with Sony being ""broke"" or ""greedy""... Seriously, who complains about a FREE game on day one?! I would much prefer brand new indie games over old and stale major titles. Anyways, I really enjoyed the first Velocity Ultra game and 2X is nothing but an improvement. 9/10 for me.... Bravo, Sony and FuturLab!. This game is so fun!! Amazing sense of pace and great level design. Plus I got it for free through ps plus. Time to finish writing this review and go back to play some more... :)",a fast paced mix of top down shooter and side scrolling platformer Velocity 2x is an entertaining little title that you can play as a straight action game or spend time relentlessly chasing high scores . while fun the game got repetitive and levels got long towards the end . the music is good but the gameplay is not enjoyable .
877.Valkyria Chronicles,"Cool art style and concept ruined by endless yammering and an uninteresting story. I shouldn't spend more time in stuck in menus and skipping cutscenes than actually playing the game.. For strategy RPG buffs, or fans of Xcom, Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing game to recommend. Great gameplay that's easy to learn, but satisfying to master (if not difficult at times). Visually stunning, because the artstyle helps it age very well. Each character has their own quirks that help them shine, or flounder, in certain circumstances, making team deployment even more crucial. Challenging, but fair gameplay. And an amazing story that makes it easy to recommend to fans of story driven games. It's a shame the two sequels were on PSP, and one not localized. If this would have sold better, it could have been a flagship title for Sega.. A fun and challenging tactical turn-based military game, great art style, graphics, and a good story. I highly recommend this one if you enjoy turn-based combat games.. A strategy game that gives you multiple classes, but only actually wants you to use 2 of them. One, where you should just endlessly spam tank-engineer-combo for all eternity and let your snipers and shocktroopers try to catch up as they are incredibly slow and useless. A game that has a somewhat decent story, but hides it behind more and more infurating missions forcing you to restart them multiple times until you figure out the actual winning strategy. Of course, also has absolutely no cheat codes to circumvent the **** At least it lets you save how often you want. I had some fun with this at the beginning, but now it frustrated me more than it was ever entertaining. All I wanna do now is to see how the story concludes, and thats it. Of course, I can't, because modern games dont include level skip codes anymore because they all ****. Oh, well.. The story was great and the character feel real in this game. Love the turn based game system in this game, it really took me by surprised on how you actually have to think sometimes when fighting and you can't just do whatever you want. The character designed was nice, water type graphic was beautiful and the music was nice. One of my favorite turn based game ever.. + Possibly the best Tactical RPG. + Mission are all unique and play very differently. + Lots of Unique characters. + Great Story - Tank controls ****. - The're some harsh difficulty spikes.. What a beautiful game! I loved playing it but I couldnt really get into the story and characters, gameplay is awesome though.. This is one of the best RPG games I ever played for 30 years: it is one of the best tactics games I ever played in 30 years. Perhaps it is the best combination of both I ever played for 30 years (did I mention that before?) The story is great, the characters will be forever in your memory. The game play is awesome and original. Learning curve is just right. Difficulty is perfect at any level. Game engine is flawless. Options are relevant and interesting. This is an amazing and truly gem ****. And you will play it again. A jaw dropping Sega classic.. This is a good strategy game with good graphics. Soundtrack is good as well although very repetitive. The voice of the main character could be better or be more enthusiastic. First missions are easy but later they get more complicated and although you can beat them your final rate won't be the best. My advice is that you save the game before every mission in case you want to restart the mission with a different team. The image of the mission is always a map so it's easy to see when to do that. Another advice would be to always left empty about 2 units (sometimes you could use only half of your team) when you deploy them because there are very slow units and it's better to conquer an enemy base and from there deploy slow units or other useful units because then you'll have much more information about the enemy units. Otherwise, if you deploy all your units you'll have to retreat them and deploy them on new bases, wasting your time and points. So, although not knowing the exact number or kind of enemies you are going to fight is part of game, they could have given you more information or at least give you the advice I gave you here: leave some empty units. About the rate if you want a good rate you'll be saving and uploading the game over and over. I don't like to do this but I did it several times. Oh! And when you are upgrading your weapons please move down the screen because there many improvements you can do and you can easily miss it. I did 2 or 3 missions until I figured out that, so remember this. It took me 40 hours with a couple of skirmishes and all the extra missions that are unlocked in Castlefront st.. The Best SRPG of his generation. IMO. Beautiful graphic style, intelligent gameplay, lovely characters, awesome soundtrack. It's a shame Sega hasn't give this franchise the respect it deserves.. This is the best game ever created. I got my marriage back on the right path and started to be a real father. I quit smoking and hookers and helped out for free in the hospital cleaning the elderly. I started a no profit organisation building schools in africa. Thank you Sega and Valkyria Chron devs. GOTD. I don't understand why this game is so hyped up, or even why it was remade on PS4. Things that piss me off: 1) At any given time, if any enemy has a shot on the back of your tank, or can position themselves to be so, YOU IMMEDIATELY LOSE, this is extremely frustrating, especially when you have to play a 2 hour long mission. 2) Movement is absolute **** having to move your characters around the levels is a pain in the ASS. You never know if they're going to make it to where you need them, you can't do it over, and if you happen to be in range of an enemy, they will simply shoot you for free until you are dead or end the turn action, which you have to learn to do QUICKLY. 3) The map, who the **** made this map, you absolutely cannot tell where ANY OBSTACLES ARE, the minimap and regular maps are absolute **** for as much as you can get out of looking at them, but the camera does this really nice pan shot through the map as it becomes the real terrain so can see how good of a job they've done of NOT REPRESENTING THE ACTUAL TERRAIN. This all being said, it is a very unique game and i would like to have seen this concept done.... you know... better.... with every single thing in the game being better explained and less counter intuitive and more forgiving.. A great game indeed, with fantastic graphics and innovative gameplay, not to mention a great story with memorable characters. The only problems with it are the (at times) frustrating tank controls, and occasional annoying grinding. But despite this, Valkyria Chronicles is still a fantastic game, no matter which console you play it on. Without a doubt one of the best games of the last generation.. Valkyria Chronicles is honestly a game that shouldn't be a game. I feel like it should be an anime that I could easily ignore, and the game itself want's to be an anime that should be easily ignored. Look, I wouldn't have a problem with the gameplay, if the game actually wanted to be played. But the problem is that it doesn't. Instead, it focuses on a love story that not only feels forced, but makes the Attack of the Clones feel shakespearean by comparison. All, that you need to know is this, after thirty minutes I decided to skip the story just to get to the game itself. The problem is that the game doesn't have any gameplay for about four hours or maybe more. I didn't bother to find out, as I couldn't take pressing ""X"" to watch the next scene anymore. Again, this is something that wanted to be an anime, but was released as a game. If you want to play a strategy RPG that is worth your time, play Disgea or Final Fantasy Tactics. This game is not worth your time, and it doesn't want to be. 1/10.. I *really* thought I would love this game based upon graphics, game style, FRPG with tactics. But here is why I had to stop playing it: (1) the controls are abysmal, like truly bad, obviously a console port but with zero effort to make them even remotely acceptable, and I tries mouse and keyboard and controller. (2) Enemy turns can take forever as each guy moves. It reminds me of Codename STEAM on 3DS which suffered similar super long enemy turns. (3) There are some major difficulty spikes (level 7 is horrible) and this exacerbates #2. (4) The 20 turn limit is really freaking stupid. I'm ok with all other tactical design choices, but artificially limiting the options with a hard turn cap is just ridiculous. (5) The cutscenes were not updated and look identical to PS3, which is ok, but not ideal. XCOM is one of my favorite games ever. I love Fire Emblem, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, Divinity Original Sin, many JRPG and some anima - many games and genres that would portend that I would love this game. But it was tedious, boring, and too difficult at times (and I usually play most games on hard).. One of my favourite games, and a big part of the reason I bought a PS3 (then they go and make a PC port, sigh). It's JRPG meets XCOM, or SRPG, because that's a thing, apparently. A unique art-style helps the game stand out, and the gameplay is excellent, however I suspect many may be turned off by the assumption that this is weeaboo crud (don't be!). A beautiful Action-Strategy hybrid, with charming artistic-style & an endearing story. Game-play is satisfyingly deep & enjoyable, and I adore the 3rd-person presentation. Plot & Characters can be a bit melodramatic, but as a whole here is a well-crafted, satisfying sRPG, with a very-unique A/V presentation. 9/10. 10/10 for me, but it certainly is a targeted audience game. Things I liked about the game (and why you may not) - Long sweeping story-line, there is tons of character development and relationship building throughout the game. If you're the kind of person that enjoys ""oh hey I just met you now we're in love forever so can we get on with the game-play?"" story-lines this isn't for you. Difficulty - not terribly unforgiving as a strategy game, but probably one of the more difficult ones I've seen in the united states. Don't enter this game unprepared or expecting to be able to brute force / rush your way through any of the levels. Be aware that the pace is made for those who like strategy games, not the traditional warfare (ex. cod) type of game-play, so this game may seem very slow paced to new players to the field. Disadvantage (part of difficulty) - Unlike most games you'll see in america where you're a god and the enemy is laughable all throughout the game, most of the time the enemies units in this game have superior abilities, maneuverability, and firepower compared to your unites. This means you actually have to plan out and outsmart the AI in order to beat the game. Team Design - You can change the balance of units in your team so that you can appropriately plan for the mission. This means that even with the best strategy in the battle, you may not have a chance without bringing the right type of units. The types of units available range from scouts, to anti-tank, to snipers and all have different abilities and controls. Overall the game-play, story-line, and difficulty level came together to make a spectacular game. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I have.. This game is only average at best. The A.I. always seems to overpower you no matter what level you are at and they get to move twice as far on the map compared to your own army. They tend to cheat and destroy your tank after 2 hits with their own tank or lancers. When you try to aim with your own tanks the aiming is very inaccurate unless you are at point blank range. Also when you save the game during a level and lose the fight when happens far too often, the game suffers from slowdown when you reload your save file. It takes a long time just to retry the stages. Potentials also don't seem to help that much.. An epic strategic rpg. The story is well written with twists and a mix of sad and joyful moments. It has one of the saddest moments in video game history for me. The characters are amazing. They all fell like they were real and alive. The graphics are unique. The game looks like a water colour painting. The soundtrack is fitting. The gameplay is unique and refreshing. Overall the game is impressive and an insider tip for all rpg and strategic game fans.. My first entry to the series was VC2 on PSP, I loved it, so I was glad to put my hands on this PS3 exclusive later. I must say, that the game is a real Gem. It has beautiful and stylish cell-shaded graphics, a story with lots of touching moments, memorable characters with a top-notch voice acting, unique and fun tactical battle system. The game is pretty hard at times, but it's worth it. One of the best games I've ever played.. Okay so my only major gripes with this game (it won't affect score) is that they allow you to enable to original japanese **** its unplayable this way. That is because they made it into an english version, and this is a heavily text based game. Is the english text a good translation of the Japanese dub? NO! Even if you can understand japanese, and read english this game is still unplayable with **** dub. I mean it was nice that they included it, but if the english text translation is totally different from what they are saying there is no point. Enough said, the game has to be played in english. This is disappointing to me since I watched the anime in **** dub and really loved the character voices. That said, the english translation is great for what it is. With the exception of the fact that they now pronounce Alicia as **** top quality if you don't deal in foreign languages. They keep the spelling as Alicia and pronounce it as Alysha in the english...which doesn't make sense. Its pronounced Alicia in the **** dub....they changed it to americanize the damn thing which was stupid idea imo. The english nicknames they decided to use are also kind of lame. None of this is affecting my review **** a solid 9/10. It does something that many other games have failed at, it makes a rts work on a console. First thing upon playing this game is, this isn't a real world simulator. It does what it does to work. It has its own gameplay rules. Its like a board game, you need to understand how things work. There isn't this intuitive sense of things where you can just run in and understand everything without practice and reading the rules. The **** blue flame I would definitely pick up. I kind of wish they offered it all as a 10$ bundle. I've only gone through about half the **** very hard mode is just plain suicidal. So if you really want a challenge it delivers. One of the dlc, enter the edy detachment is terribly short...which is disappointing given its cost. So its pick and choose if you want best value with the dlc. I suggest reading the instruction manual. It's very important that you know that shock troopers have a 30 degree interception fire line of sight. in comparison scouts have a 50 degree line. So your shock troops isn't going to shoot at an enemy that is running toward it, unless it is within that 30 degree area it is facing. Its really important your troops are facing the right direction when you end your turn. Killing enemy troops on the enemy's turn is very important in the game. Snipers and lancers don't have intercepting **** they won't return fire on approaching enemies. The game has a steep kind of learning curve. It isn't trying to be realistic, its trying to work as an rts on a **** it works wonderfully. So why not a 10? Cause the enemy ai isn't exactly stellar. I've yet to see an enemy engineer do any engineer work. Also there's no online component which is disappointing. Also no trophy component which....I don't get why they didn't. Adding trophies is good advertising if nothing else. Lot of love and other stuff here. I played through the campaign twice thus far and its just as fun the second time around. I wish there was more content at the end of it though. The campaign only has 1 difficulty. Some of the missions are insanely difficult/infuriating your first time through, others not so much. Overall its not the most consistent difficulty curve but it offers the right level of challenge. A great game that you should play if you own a ps3. I wish the sequels would get ported to the ps3.. Goods - VERY engaging story - VERY engaging game play - Missions are difficult yet very reward which makes you want more - Good characters Bads - Sometimes you have a better CHANCE of hitting someone at 1% than at 99% Extras - Last boss is extremely annoying so be prepared ! - Highly recommended for those who like tactical strategy!!. Simply outstanding... Timeless graphics/presentation, superb and innovative gameplay, and a well told mature story are only a few reasons to love this game. It mixes so many genres together in a euphoric blend of rpg and strategy that anyone can pick up and love. I can't think of any faults to this masterpiece, go out and get it already!. One of the best games of all time, certainly the best game for PS3. Beautiful story, vivid characters, humor, drama everything is here and with all balanced enough of movies and gaming, which is converted to Hard Mode hardcore tactical problems. Beautiful visual style, excellent musical accompaniment a long time since I felt such euphoria of the game!. In an era of Call of Duty, Halo, Battlefield, or shooters being called Role Playing Games, Tactical RPG's from Japan look like if they were made for people of the 90's. Besides all the world against SEGA WOW, Valkyria Chronicles stands alone, as the best Tactical Role Playing Game I have ever played. With memorable characters, beautiful art style, epic story and amazing music, Valkyria Chronicles stands as the best RPG of the current generation, the one known for its Shooters. ""Tactical Adventure Third Person Shooter Role Playing Game"", that's how we can call it. Yes, that intense this game is. Valkyria Chronicles showoffs of what it is done, and it is done of poor quality. Extracting great elements from RPGs, as well as amazing controls for battle, the game itself marks the revival of the JRPG's in general, and is clearly one of the most revolutionaries of the history. From Bruhl to Fouzen and Randgriz to Barious, the game tells us the story of a squad of the Gallian's Liberation Front, in their struggle to save the beloved country from the invader Empire, who, with their Emperor Maximillian, is seeking for the lance and power of an amcient civilization known as the Valkyria. The game is not predictable, I can ensure that, as the story twists are real unexpected. In brief, Valkyria Chronicles is the best RPG of the current generation. Just a few flaws on the moving units, as well as the issues with the Third Person perspective are remarkable, but beyond that, the game is fully enjoyable and likeable. Valkyria Chronicles, is by far, the best PlayStation 3 exclusive title, and a must-have game on the valuable collection of this system.. A great game, both gameplay wise and story wise. The characters capture you instantly, so whenever something bad happens, you truly feel sorry. The combat is turn based in a way, but it's always satisfying to take out an enemy to the very end... and the game isn't short either, it took me over 60 hours to complete. There isn't much to do besides the main story, but it's always exciting to get the occasional side quest/mission and learn more about each character.. I was honestly surprised when I bought this game, especially since I fail miserably at tactical games, but this game was a huge surprise in both gameplay and difficulty. The game mixes elements of tactics (you move characters on a map), with rpg elements (you gain exp, power up stuff, gather members), and also elements of a shooter (you go into third person mode when you have to shoot). But the battle aren't the only good thing: characters and the setup are fantastic too, set in an alternative europe with different beliefs, but at the same time similar to the real europe, making us feel comfortable with the setting but still being able to tell new things. I haven't completely finished it yet but the game is luckily very versatile and, even if it's sometimes cheating, it's a good game and really pays off your dedication. But even then I do have some big complains about this game, and one of them is the classes. First off, I did love the fact that you don't believe your members by themselves, but they level up characters that are all in class, using the experience gained from battles (and skirmishes, which are the random battles of the game): this easily kills the constant grinding for leveling each character because you'll just level all characters from a certain **** few classes are extremely and completely hard to use properly, making them worthless, like the shocktroopers and the lancers (your basic soldier and rocket launchers). Both these classes are used only in few moments, but because of their EXTREME slowness, they won't be able to be of any use when you're a lot forward into the camp or when you need proper action, leaving the main job to scouts (weaker, but much more mobile and can kill pretty good, if you aim to the head), engineers (weaker scouts, but they can repair the tank, replenish ammo, have more bombs, have good mobility and their weapon is the same as the scouts), and even snipers (they're even slower than shocktroopers and **** they can 1-shot enemies from far, making them a must). Even your tank is better, even if slow, because it can kill everyone on the battlefield and only explosives and rockets can hurt him. In the end, even if lancers are good against tanks, making them a LITTLE more useful than the shocktroopers, these ones are and will remain a defensive type of soldier, which is a bit of disappointment considering their huge amount of damage they can do. Too bad, this issue would have been fixed if your tank could move them as a transport. Another big problem also, is the enemy that, even if sometimes acting as a random, they can shoot you more precisely than a sniper at times (a tank was able to destroy a group of soldier from almost the other side of the map, and a soldier was able to shoot me through the bridge rails). Luckily the enemy will still act randomly and won't be a big of an issue, but if you're not careful your group will perish from their inhuman aiming. And **** game randomly ramps up in difficulty during fights. The biggest examples were the first battles of the game, where I was supposed to use the tank to fight **** the tank wouldn't arrive until I was almost dead (and luckily I managed to pass the mission just in time). Another big example was when I was fighting the enemy, everything was doing fine, **** unspotted tank came in, and destroyed my camp, and almost failed the mission (at least the game told me to bring some lancers), without mentioning a boss tank could almost 3 shot me even with full defensive upgrades available. As I said, I haven't completed the game, but these are some small examples of how the game will tease you, and it can be a problem because, if you don't act on time, you might fail and restart the game, in order to make a proper group (thus, becoming a trial and error game). I do like this game though, despite the flaws, because of the amazing amount of details they've put on anything, like soldier's backstories, weapons and tank upgrades, well thought level up system, and a detailed story with a well balanced roster of character (balanced, because they all are the main characters, in the end), and it really saddens me that this game didn't have a good popularity, because it deserved a proper success and, unfortunely, it showed how good games and well thought games can fail because of poor marketing (Okami on the ps2 is the prime example). If you ever find this game, I'd highly suggest to give it a try, because I did the mistake of following bad reviews (mentioning that it was either hard as hell, or badly programmed), and only now I recovered my mistake. Worth trying, especially because it might be cheap, and good games on the ps3 are still a rare sight to spot.. Very good game, it may look simple but it has much to offer. Every mission in the game can last hours or it can last a few minutes if you know the tricks. Graphics is beautiful and story is very interesting. I must say, this is one of the best games I have ever played and I strongly recommend to PS3 owners.. Video game master piece. the game is completely stunning and runs on SAGAs canvas engine which makes every moment of the game looks stunning. The story is great to filled with characters that have an anime style that doesn't use to much of the anime stereotypes. the story line is set around the invasion of the nation Gallia with other sub plots being winded into the main plot. The games a must buy for any RPG fan and if you have to buy a PS3 just to play this amazing game. just writing this review makes me want to play it.. Waouh, i like the cartoon style. I didnÂ´t get far in the game because of the AI, who was cheating a lot. It made me mad :-), so i stopped. But i think it deserve a nice 7. One of the best games I've ever played! Great story, it is an anime-game (Game came first) and a very well working combination of RTS-RPG. If you don't like RTS & RPG don't play this game. Beautifully innovative game gives players something to keep coming back to. The battle system is something reminiscent of tabletop roleplaying games like Warhammer 40k, but not over-complicated. Challenging and engaging, this game has it all! Even if anime-style graphics are a turn-off, I'd encourage anyone to at least rent this game, or play the demo. This game is, if nothing else, ONE OF A KIND!. This is by far my favorite original game (meaning: no sequel) for the Playstation 3. Everything about this game is adorable, the characters are interesting and loveable, the setting is gorgeous and unique, storyline highly immersing and beautifully written. This game is considered an RPG by many, I would consider it a tactical Action Adventure with some RPG elements such as character classes and development of which. I have not seen another PS3 game (except MGS4) with such a high density in its atmosphere. You control a group of soldiers with different classes, such as scouts, snipers and shocktroopers that you can place freely in the battles that take place throughout the game. What starts out as a mission to defend their hometown, ends as a journey to save a whole continent. I have yet to play another PS3 game whose characters I loved more or whose gameplay and atmosphere had me more immersed.. Sega has, historically, made some of the best lighthearted JRPGs. While growing up I was a huge fan of the Phantasy Star series of games, and have always lamented the fact that that specific portion of the genre seems to have disappeared after the creation of PS IV. This game is, by my estimation, the closest thing to a true SMS/Genesis Phantasy Star game that we're going to get in this console generation, in the best way possible. This game tells the tale **** of normal folks, thrust into a world conflict, and their struggle to overcome an invasion of their peaceful country. It is well written, the combat is well paced, and overall it is one of the best games I've played on PS3. After completing it the first time I started it over again, with the new game + option, and went through the effort of obtaining all of the hidden weapons, and companions possible. When you add in the DLC and all of the optional missions and challenges this game can easily occupy you for a few months. All in all it is an amazing effort from the Sega team, and is personally one of my favorite PS3 games. It's just a shame that the sequels were all PSP games, aimed at a less mature audience.. Missed this game when it came out originally but sure am glad I found it. Very fun and very well made. Wish more games could surprise me like this one.. After getting a brand new PS3, this game was on my hunting list for must own PS3 games since I have played it before. Damn, it is still good as I remember it. Though I do have a problem with its anime like storytelling, the story itself is engaging enough and the characters, though completely anime cliche ridden, are very likable. Finishing up with the story of the game, the gameplay itself is the main reason why this game is great. The easy to learn but hard to master strategy based RPG gameplay is just so intense and so enjoyable to play. There are many variables and so many options on how to use your squad to win a battle. This is one of the best games I have played on the PS3 by a mile and if you love strategy and RPG, get it.. Quite possible one of the best games on the Playstation 3, great story, art, music and gameplay. You'll keep trying to do every mission without losing any of the militia. 9/10. This is by far the best SRPG I have ever played. The unique realtime combat system is excellent and the wonderfull art, interesting storyline, well written dialogue and supurb soundtrack create a truely charming atmosphere.. This is a fantastic game. I picked it up about a year after it came out and wish I got it way back. If you love anime, strategy RPGs, or even just JRPGs you will most likely enjoy this game. Tons of content and a full story that never drags or seems dull. The combat system is the most fun Ive had in a turn based system. Its as close to a video game version of warhammer tabletop. Do yourself a favor and check it out.. I can honestly say i didn't like this game at all when I first bought it, but as time went it grew on me. The game looks interesting, and streams beautifully on the PS3. The battle system is interesting,but most of all I loved the fact that you could chose your units fo battle, and as a plus they each feature bio to show there own story. Take it from me, you need to get this game, and at its reduced price its worth it.. The main cast of characters are a memorable group with unique personalities and a decent amount of development. The supporting cast is large and varied and each one has a reasonable amount of backstory to them too. Moreover the group as a whole becomes really memorable, as you pick and choose characters that you like and that work well together thanks to the great potential system, they bond together and will stick in your mind as Squad 7. The story itself is very enjoyable, a mix of romance, fantasy, war and racial tensions which draws many parralells with the real conflict of world war 2, overall it's a wonderful breath of fresh air and a much needed break from the myriad flavours of power fantasy. The gameplay system is great and really brought the SRPG genre along leaps and bounds. It becomes really enjoyable 1/4 of the way into the game when it starts throwing immense set pieces into the mix. The anime artsyle really looks great while at the same time it remains down to earth and not too garish. The bottom line is this is a must have game. The only reason I gave it a 9 is because it shouldn't be PS3 exclusive as it's a great game! The graphics are original thanks to the CANVAS engine, the gameplay is original (as far as I know) and the story reflects some parts of our European history. The only reason why I think this is a 16+ game is because of the one curse word and the death animation of a character but I'd say even teenagers could accept the facts of what happened in the war and enjoy a somewhat light hearted take on the subject. Anyway, the experience is unique and even has the option to replay on Hard Mode for the serious games as well as DLC if you think it ends there. As for controls, they are really good, no input lag, easy to get into (not if ","for strategy RPG buffs, or fans of Xcom, Valkyria Chronicles is an amazing game to recommend . great gameplay that's easy to learn, but satisfying to master (if not difficult at times) visually stunning, because the artstyle helps it age very well ."
878.Killer Instinct Season 3,"Season 3 is a total blast. Eyedol alone is fantastic! Any newness for ki is a great thing. This is one of the best games ever made. Good graphics, gameplay, lot of characters, content, beautiful fight game of the generation. So far, I remember downloading over 60gb on updates for this game. Could be more, though. Someone gotta tell these boys at Iron Galaxy that updating is not fun. Specially when it comes to a fighting game which quick instant action is the core appeal. By the time the next 5gb update is ready, momentary interest is already gone. Let alone the fact that not everybody got a fast Internet connection and regular updates could render hours of inability to play. I'm looking forward giving Killer Instinct another try. When it is finished, that is.. Aeeeeyy this game is priddy gud Killer **** where they make you spend 40$ per DLC release but people don't seem to care because it's Rareware being manipulated by Microsoft. At least it's Rareware right? On lifesupport. A game of 2013 that just is completed in 2016... Well done Rare, you know how to innovate in this industry. Street Fighter V may be incomplete but at least has better controls and not make us wait more than 2 years. The graphics are good, but Mortal Kombat X has more fighters and more variety.. a great fighting game with good graphics and plenty of combos which if you learn them well can kill your opponent in question is minutes pity that not an had good creativada placing new characters and cast some of the killer instinct gold worth be in this great title. Beauty and fast, very good figting game, in fact maybe there´s no other explanation that i feel it a little easy and full spaming moves, not so tactic like Tekken or Virtua Fighter. Negative-Low Score is from the Sony-Haters. Dont mind of that! This game just amazing. This is without a doubt my game of the year. Amazing visual presentation with seamless transitions from game play to cut scenes and vise versa. Graphics, Sound, and control are best of the best.. As always one of the best fighting games of these gen, always upgrading and making a better way to improve every single aspect in game. i what to give a perfect score but im still waiting for the story mode and a true boss for the game, a non select boss and hard to beat, lets hope than the guys of iron galaxy make a good decition with final boss gargos (sorry about my english, is not my native lenguage). Best fighting game to ever hit a console. Some of the greatest music and soundtracks with beautiful graphics and unmatched gameplay mechanics. Unfortunately those who give this game a negative rating surely must be bitter because of how hard SF5 flopped but wow this game is amazing.. Love this game - keeps getting better and better! The new lighting is AMAZING -- really pushes the visual bar and the cast of characters is the best in a fighting game -- such diversity!","i'm looking forward giving Killer Instinct another try . when the next 5gb update is ready, momentary interest is already gone . Mortal Kombat X has more fighters and more variety ."
879.The Messenger,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. quite a funny game. The Messenger is a delightful game to go through, surprising me a lot with just how enjoyable I found it to be! the humor personally hit very well with me, and the game only got better as it went on. platforming got a bit frustrating at times, but not to the point of genuine dislike.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ¡This game is incredible! I've never been much of a Metroidvania type player, this is my first time with this type of game and I'm having a BLAST. I think the Messager can be a nice albeit average addition to anybody's platformer collection. Gameplay wise I liked a handful of the levels and challenges but the controls and knockback made the experience cluncky. Writing is funny, there are some cool surprises in the game, the pixel art, music and sound are too oldschool for my taste and in general I don't like when artists just copy a style without bringing something new to it. The metroidvenia part it's just backtracking with the abilities you have already aquired.. This title is everything that is great about 2D platforming, but with a very nice twist that makes it stand out on its own. I found the overall story to be pretty standard at first glance. But as it progressed, I was pleased to see that the writing contained some great humour and cleverly tied into the platforming itself. I don't want to spoil anything, but the way the game transitions from normal platformer to metroidvania is brilliant! In saying that, there was some great character progression that accompanies some very tight gameplay. Every time things did get difficult it was tough but very fair. Needless to say, the gameplay blended in beautifully with the 8/16 bit graphics and top notch soundtrack. It's hard to write too much as this is a title that shouldn't be spoiled. It might look familiar at first glance, but under the surface you'll find a very original title indeed. Worth every cent.. Good lord, this has got to be one of the clunkiest games that has ever graced my PS5. **** demands absolute precision from me by filling the screen with dozens of enemies, projectiles, and environmental hazards, then I also demand absolute precision from that game's controls and that is just not the case here. The controls are just dumb. The gliding should've been put on literally ANY OTHER BUTTON other than the jump button, then going into a glide instead of a cloudwalk could've been avoided entirely. Similar thing with the wall clawing: Put it on a button instead of the character automatically holding onto every wall! Also, old folks might enjoy all the NES-era BS like getting knocked back when you get hit, or medusa heads with an frustratingly annoying pattern, or EVERY ENEMY RESPAWNING INSTANTLY WHEN THEY GET BACK INTO FRAME (??!!), but I very much don't. There's a reason why that stuff had been thoroughly discarded and left in the past, and that's because it was total nonsense and just annoying AF to deal with. None of that s**t belongs in a video game released in 2018. Nuff said.. A brilliant tribute to classic games of the NES era, such as Ninja Gaiden. Fun gameplay, witty writing and amazing style, this game is fantastic in most ways, other than the story. The story is very much a non priority for most of the game. Yes, it's there but there's no long periods of dialogue vomit and story segments are kept brief. However, this seems to be because they dumped all the lore and story into the last hour of the game, completely changing the pace and slowing down the otherwise great ending sequence. The games difficulty is something to applaud. It is most definitely difficult, but never unfair. Every death felt like it was my fault and I never got stuck on an area for too long. Mechanics are easy to grasp but hard to master, and the feeling of mastering the game is great.. I am a huge pixelart 2d platformer fanboy. I did not felt satisfied to complete this game, especially since its asking you to go through it twice without any original reason. I liked the humor and some of the levels but to me it was a decent experience.. This game is a real hidden gem. First i was not interested in it's style and gameplay but as soon as i started playing i got **** in and couldn't put it down until the credits rolled. It's a masterpiece when it comes to visual style, soundtrack and addictive, hard but very rewarding gameplay. On top of that the writing is just great and full of awesome humor. For me its a must play even if you are not a fan ****.. A flawed great game. Emphasis on the flawed. The second half really isn't nearly as fun as the first, despite the gameplay twist being really clever in concept.. Really good game! Loved the shopkeeper, fun gameplay and nice Design. Can't wait for a second game. Also watch out for their new game sea of stars, demo was good.. This is one of the most entertaining games I've ever played. The narrative is so well written, the shopkeeper is my favorite characters without a doubt, his stories are so good & his humour is very much on point. The overall tone of the game is brilliant. The gameplay is quite simple but very effective. The music is some of the best you'll encounter in a game. The game is mostly linear but half way through you're sent on a bit of goose chase, had it not been for that, I'd give this game a 10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game is not good. you cant have really good fun with this one. it is really bad. this game is very bad with no good gameplay, the lack of content is huge. i hate it. this game has a easy going through history with not good content ahead. im so sad about this one. Really fun platformer in Ninja Gaiden style with metroidvania twist. Its have some stupidly hard segments but overall difficulty well balanced, and level design are good. Game is not cheap, but it takes like 16 hours to beat if you try to find all secrets. One of my favourite games on Switch. Great platformer with some great humour and story telling thrown in. I found the DLC to be a bit meh, but the main game is incredible. Bit of a challenge at times, but balanced well with upgrades.. An 8-bit side scroller that takes a few twists and turns before turning into a mixed 8 and 16 bits metroidvania adventure. Yes, it's a weird game. CONS: RAW AROUND THE EDGES: From the core mechanics to the levels, some parts of The Messenger are way better than others. That handmade feel is charming in its own way, but it grows old as you keep playing. IT GETS WORSE AS IT GOES: The game starts very strong. After the main plot twist, however, it sets on a descending path of disappointing challenges, excessive backtracking, and disappointing bosses. Collecting all the power seals was a particular disappointment for me. WILD DIFFICULTY SWINGS: The difficulty is where the ""amateur"" origin of the game is at its most jarring. The game is never too hard–just quite frustrating at times. Some bosses (including the last ones) are pushovers, and some platforming challenges will leave you wondering what the whole point was. On the other hand, the unrefined mechanics turn some sequences into tedious button mashing marathons that are heavily dependent on sheer luck. PROS: A HEARTFELT GAME: Even at its rawest, The Messenger still gives you good vibes. It's clearly a labour of love from a small, dedicated team. I had to add one point to my rating just because of The Messenger's sincerity. VERY ADDICTIVE: I had a lot of fun with this game for a few hours. Even the last third of the game, that I criticised, couldn't drive me off. I simply couldn't stop playing until the end. IT WILL MAKE YOU SMILE: The continuous fourth wall breaking might be cliche, but it does elicit plenty of smiles. The writing is witty and lively, but the game never takes itself seriously–and that attitude makes you feel part of it.. Just one of my favorite indie game ! It's like Shinobi but better with a precise gameplay, great humor, cool caracters and a good story. The game is foul of surprise to the beginning at the end and I particulary appreciated hiddings dialogs. I can't wait to play the next game of Sabotage studio !. A great little gem this Messenger. It offers tight platforming and challenging boss battles, seasoned with the silly or even philosophical stories of the shopkeeper, an NPC who accompanies the messenger on his expedition. Ingenious how the double jump is implemented, you need to hit an enemy or a lantern before executing it, which makes the game more demanding. Another strength of this title in the later half is the constant visual and aural change between an 8bit and a 16bit style, all served in marvellous pixel art and an engrossing soundtrack. It's only later I noticed this game also has an option to be played in Quebec French, a thing I never encountered before, even not in hockey games. Finally I wonder how will be the RPG the same developers are working on.. The game is really fun and has an awesome soundtrack but I lost interest when it turned into a Metroidvania (and I love Metroidvanias).. I heard nothing but praise for this game but held off for a really good sale. Finally bit the bullet and I couldn't be happier. One of the reasons I delayed was that I heard it was really hard. A lot of these 8bit throwback type games really try to hit that old-school difficulty. I just don't have the temperament or desire to play and replay punishingly difficult games anymore. Thankfully, while it is challenging, it's not overwhelming and the checkpoints are fair. (i just finished the free DLC and it's brutal, but that's another issue). What I had no idea about was just how funny the game is. There's a lot of clever and often hilarious meta-humor. Great action and platforming in an entertaining retro package. I can't really think of any major flaws. Amazing game. Beautiful pixel art. the first two hours of the game, I though it was just a fund platformer, but then the game opens into something huge and fantastic . one of the best indie platforms / metroidvanias I've seen.. + one of the best pixel art i' ve seen + one of the best retro soundtracks i've heard + tight controls, fluid movement + balanced difficulty + transition between 8-bit and 16-bit keeps the stages fresh Cons: - backtracking is not always clear - story only makes sense at the end. This game is extremely entertained in all ways. At the forefront, of course, is the hilarious writing which deserves all the praise in the world. I was going through the adventure if only to see what new wacky dialogue the Shopkeeper would have in store for me next. Though in reality there was more keeping me engaged than the writing. The graphics and the sound are phenomenal, and the fact they had to go through and make two different sets of the whole game is just breathtaking. If there's anywhere the game struggles even a tad it's the end, because it just feels like it ends without any of the problems really having time to be solved, and you don't get to know the final boss much in the first place.. Amazing game. Once you ""think"" it is done a whole new game opens up. The retro combinations are really fun. To have it 100% completed takes time but it is really rewarding. The free DLC is really fun as well.. I tried to like this game but everything from the start feels repetitive. The flow of the game is a bit to slow.. I picked up this game and was immediately hooked. Everything about this game is amazing: Gameplay, Soundtrack (best soundtrack i've heard in a long time), Graphics (both of them), Game Mechanics. Time Travel, Cloud Stepping, Rope Dart, Wingsuit. Everything about this game makes you feel like a badass. The soundtrack is the best one i've heard in a LONG time, and the fact there are two versions for each track (8-bit, 16-bit) makes it even better. The graphics are amazing. beatiful backgrounds, tilesets and character designs (also two versions for everything). And finally: the writing. The writing in this game is brilliant and funny, with each character having a full fleshed-out personality (the shopkeeper is my favorite character). This quickly became one of my all-time favorite games and is easily my best game of 2018. If you haven't played this game; play it. NOW.. The first part of this game is excellent, a relatively difficult platformer with great mechanics and cool bosses, sprinkled with a bit humour - the second half though ... it's like popping a balloon. The game loses direction, and you need to backtrack by simply doing large parts of the map yet again - which just feels unneccessary. It would be a much better game if it just stayed a pure platformer throughout instead of trying to be a metroidvania towards the end, in my opinion. Still worth playing for the first part alone.. Recently completed the messenger based on recommendation and it was incredible. For me the difficulty was perfect. The change halfway through the game completely made the game. If it wasn’t for that I think it wouldn’t have been anywhere near as good as it was. Collecting shards was great and the system where they told you how many left in each level was perfect. One of the best platformer I ever played. On my Nintendo Switch this is one of the best game in my collection.. Great homage to old school 2D platformers without falling into the ""me too"" category. Very reminiscent of Shovel Knight in terms of how high quality it is done and polished but with a very different art style, gameplay, and personality. I actually found myself reading optional dialogue cuz it's so amusing. Art and Music are great though the main theme gets repetitive fast. There is some backtracking though thanks to a twist mechanic it's not entirely rehashing old areas. Reexploring old areas with the Metroid style map isn't perfect as it's hard to tell where certain connecting points between areas meet and there aren't quick travel portals everywhere that would be convenient. Other small complaint is that there isn't much enemy variety and enemies take backseat to spikes and falling hazards.. The Messenger is an independently developed 2d action-platform title. The game opens with a village of ninjas being attacked by a Demon King, starring defeat in the face a legend known as the ""Western Hero"" appears. He hands a scroll to one of the surviving ninjas, appointing him as ""The Messenger"" and telling him to deliver it to the top of a mountain in order to save the last of mankind. These 2d indie platformers are ten and penny these days but The Messenger is a cut above the rest. There are a couple of difficulty spikes, but for the most part the learning curve is brilliantly managed (something that can’t always be said about this genre) with new actions and controls being steadily introduced throughout. The level design is excellent throughout, and thanks to the precise controls, offers a good challenge without ever becoming too frustrating. A neat little twist, which I won’t spoil, also helps to mix things up just as the game may have started to become repetitive meaning that at less than £10.00 this is an absolute bargain.. Probably one of the best indie games every made. It takes a bit of time to build up its core mechanics, which might be boring for some initially, but when you think you know what the game is all about - BOOM another dimension. The story telling is also very funny and memorable. I wasn't a fan of the music initially as I was used to the complexity of the Shovel Knight OST but it's perfect match for the gameplay with some outstanding tracks.. Probably one of the best games I've ever played. If you complete the game you will get it. Trust me.. Amazing game that brings back the fun that games gave you when it was excellent game design that made you keep playing and beating it again and again, like Super Mario Bros. and other indie games like Haunted Halloween 86. Just pure fun from start to finish.. Fantastic game, i absolutely love all of the references to tribute Ninja Gaiden. It's so well done. But the only thing I would change is adding more warp zone spots and if you change controls it Won't change the menu controls also like it does. Other than that i couldn't put it down once I started playing it.. Amazing game! If you loved Ninja GAIDEN you will love The Messenger. A tribute to retro gaming.. One of the best platformers any fan of the genre will play, with hilarious dialogues and unforgettable characters it becomes my 2018 goty.. Wish some SMS/NES/Genesis/SNES games played this well. This is an awesome ninja game, some of the challenges are WTF, but this is a must own for a classic gamer. If you like Ninja Gaiden, Strider, Shinobi and retro platformers this is money well spent.. The Messenger is one of the best games I've played recently. It starts off as a great 8-bit styled platformer, with clear inspiration from the NES Ninja Gaiden series. Thankfully, it's not nearly as difficult (i.e. frustrating) as those games were (oh Ship of Doom...). So then... well, SPOILER ALERT the game turns into a great Metroidvania game. And it's a really good one. I mean, on some level, it doesn't really do anything new, but it just does it all so well. I still have a few gripes (I always do), so I'll just mention them in passing during the review. The controls are tight, but I wish the floating mechanics were not as easily confused with the double jump mechanic. Although that may have been a deliberate decision for level-design reasons. The graphics are great. The boss designs are also awesome, animations are fluid, and the scenery is unbelievable in the ""16-bit"" version. Level design is really good, secrets are just hard enough to find, but not painfully obscure as to be frustrating. One thing that deserves mention is the humour. After playing Donut County not long ago, I was doubtful video games could be funny anymore. Well, here comes The Messenger to the rescue. Decent non-toilet humour with good timing, I mean, when's the last time I saw this in a game? Also, DLC is free! Picnic Panic is actually pretty good, and I hate DLC. All in all, I can't recommend The Messenger enough. It also plays perfectly on Switch, so if you're debating which version to purchase, this is probably as good as any.. If you own a Switch, and don't own The Messenger, you seriously need to reconsider what you're doing with your life.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best platformers in the modern era. A game that starts off like Ninja Gaiden and becomes Castlevania through the use of new and clever game mechanics. A real treat for those who want a retro-style game with excellent level design and an innovative ability scale.. You're a ninja, you've been given a scroll and have a banging soundtrack to kick ass too........lets go save the world. I knew limited information about The Messenger before diving in and damn am I glad I took a gamble. This game rocks. From its epic chip tune soundtrack to the simple but effective gameplay 'The Messenger' will keep you hooked until you reach its conclusion and reveal what the message you are carrying is all about. Without giving too much away, which arguably may have already been revealed to you if you have seen any trailers for the game, the game is split into two halves. The first half, a traditional platformer and the latter half a metroidvania. Utilising some clever gameplay mechanics and a dynamically changing soundtrack I couldn't wait to jump back in each time and start kicking ass all over again. The writing is very clever and never afraid to poke fun at itself which made the story that much more enjoyable. Please keep an eye out for the sarcastic shop keeper. The one criticism which has been raised in other reviews and I accept it too is that the pace slows a tad at the mid point. Its very easy to fall off the band wagon at this point but I'm very glad I stuck it through. An indie gem and a standout title for 2018. Now go and deliver that message.. This game was great, but like its ridiculous story, it just went overboard when there was no need. + the in game mechanics are **** fantastic, the ability to jump after landing a hit on anything was pure genius + the music, oh lord is the music solid + the boss fights are a blast - the story was unnecessarily complicated (sky giants? what?) - the little fables got tiresome - my biggest flaw with the game is that it turned into a Metroid-Mania 1/3 of the way through. The game was literally perfect going left to right, fighting bosses at the end of each level. Then, out of nowhere, all that ends and you have to go searching for small holes. Hated that they did that.. I was surprised how much the game grew on me. At first, it feels almost too familiar. But the flawless controls, the well-balanced difficulty, the structural change in the middle of the game, and the unexpectedly exceptional storytelling, won me over completely.. Watched the trailer for The Messenger and purchased the game soon after. Knew I was in for a good ride and was not disappointed. From the mesmerizing pixel art, to the succulent soundtrack masterpiece and into the seriously challenging but manageable platforming, even some good humor. This game is packed with soul, a must buy and one the best games of 2018.. the best indie game in 2018. Presentation. 8/10 Graphics TV. 7.5/10 Graphics Handheld. 8/10 Music. 9.5/10 Controls. 10/10 Fun-factor. 9.5/10 Score. 9.5/10. Fantastic old school game!!! 20/10!!! I hope we'll see Messenger 2 next year!. metroidvania style. very well done, interesting story and gameplay. only flaw is the use of b button to fly, very frustrating. everything else is ok. I beat the Messenger and thought I was done only half way through! It is divided into a linear part and then a more exploring part (though I used a guide mostly here). Pros: - The 8 to 16 bit was pretty cool - even if graphically I couldn't always tell - Bosses were well done - Perfect amount of challenge Cons: - If I didn't have a guide I would of repeated sections many, many times versus just many times - A couple frustrating spots of platforming Cons: - Really not many, I suppose it was missing something (I don't know what) that would of made it a 10 for me. Oh I love this game. I never had a console as a kid, so I was always hoping to find a game that I can really dig into. I had a lot of missteps along the way, but Messenger finally delivers for me. It has that retro feel, but yet it's a really well made, contemporary experience. Can't say I've beaten it yet, but I'm on my way!. Unfortunately this game could have been great if they had just worked on the controls a little bit more. The big main mechanic of the game is ""cloud stepping"" where you can jump again in mid-air after attacking an enemy or object. The problem is that they tried to bog the jump mechanic down with so many other functions that the game often has trouble figuring out what exactly you want to do. Not only do you have the double-jump after an attack, you can also jump and press jump again to glide, jump and press a button to do a downward attack, jump and press a button to launch a grappling hook and you have wall claws to cling to walls. Because so much is tied to jumping, I often found myself gliding when I didn't want to, clinging to walls at the worst moments and missing critical grapples. Worst of all, there's often a big of lag between your aerial attacks and your ability to jump again, meaning that you've often fallen a fair distance from your target before you get that second jump off. Other than that, the enemy designs are meh, mostly just copy pasted from other games, the platforming portions are meh, neither too hard nor really interesting, and as others have said, the ""skill tree"" is utterly pointless. TLDR: This would be a fine game to pick up for $5 or less. It's not worth the full $20.. All the fun I had with a game was overshadowed by really frustrating final boss fight. I do not get why would developers want to torture gamers, at what point did they think that meshing b button would be fun as a final challenge. I spent over 20 hours on the game and I am stuck at a stupid, pointless point, trying to mesh B button.. I knew I was going to like The Messenger from the moment I watched the trailer. I like ninjas. I like video games. I like video games about ninjas. What I didn’t expect from The Messenger was to be completely enraptured by it, teleporting me back to my childhood where I couldn’t get the game out of my head. For a week straight, it seemed like all I could think about was The Messenger. When I wasn’t playing, I was wishing I was. If I wasn’t playing, I was listening to the soundtrack. If I wasn’t playing, I was searching for developer interviews, watching twitch streams, or simply just thinking about the world and its characters. With The Messenger, Sabotage Studios has created a modern classic that doesn’t just play immaculately, but engages the player in new and surprising ways that speaks to both the child and adult within you. On the surface, The Messenger begins as a fairly standard Ninja Gaiden-inspired platformer. You do sweet front flips and you cut up demons with some of the tightest, most responsive controls anyone can ask for. The story? Deliver a scroll to the top of a mountain on the other side of the land to stop those demons from destroying the last of humankind. However, it doesn’t take long before the game starts standing out on its own by introducing new mechanics and some great writing. If you’re at all interested in what I’ve said so far, I’d just go play the game and stop reading. The Messenger is meant to surprise and catch you off guard and while I’m not going to specifically spoil anything, I do want to dive a little deeper into the game. The Messenger really starts to shine by showing its personality and the motto of developer Sabotage Studios, “retro aesthetics with modern game design.” The game looks absolutely gorgeous with some of the best pixel art out there and the music is equally awesome. Playing the game is a dream, but The Messenger also had me looking forward to every new level to see the artwork and hear the next track. Amazing NES aesthetics? Check. Beyond the aesthetics, your ninja will evolve as you play with some handy upgrades that push his abilities from rookie ninja to grand master. Exploring the environment will net you time shards that you can use in the shop to purchase a wide range of upgrades from shurikens to new attacks to health upgrades. Each upgrade feels impactful and worth the purchase. Other upgrades come as you progress through the game like the Wingsuit, which lets you slowly glide over chasms or ride gusts of air vertically. Even for someone like me, who explored every nook and cranny and unlocked every upgrade well before the end of the game, I never was bored with the gameplay because mastering both the character and the levels were so much fun. And speaking of the shop, The Messenger’s shopkeeper is just as important (and frankly, more memorable) as the main character. The shopkeeper is the game’s main way to give flavor text to the environments, present some backstory, tell stories, and dole out a heaping helping of comedy. He’s my favorite character of the year. Maybe he’s a woman actually? I don’t know. But I love him. Without going into any spoilers, I just will say that the game’s writing is commendable. The game seamlessly walks the line of being philosophical and satirical while never ceasing to be flat-out entertaining. It’s the main reason why I feel like the game pulls off what so few games, or any other media, accomplish: speaking to both the child and the adult within you. Playing the game felt like going back in time, but hearing the story and listening to some things the shopkeeper says really spoke to the man I am today. The Messenger is a game that sets out to play with your expectations. Just when it feels like your NES adventure is about to come to a close, the game turns into something new and fresh, giving you a whole new experience to play on top of what was already a solid game. I would love to sit and chat about every aspect about The Messenger but that’s not what this review is meant for. I’ll leave you with this; The Messenger is one of the best games I’ve ever played. Period. And all I want to do is go back to playing it a hundred more times. See ya!. It seems like a lot of gamer's are saying their burnt out on the nostalgic 8/16 bit pixel art, that developers are taking the easy way out and copying older classics, but this is far from the truth with The Messenger . Now maybe you didn't grown up on the NES and don't appreciate some of the hardest, well designed, fun to return to time and time again adventures ever! or maybe because there's been a plethora of these games recently, ,that some of these outstanding titles have been over looked and neglected. The Messenger stands on its own, sure some of us will look at it and say Ninja gaiden but once you pick it up the music HITS! and you get into the game play it simple to see this isn't some copycat or wanna be.t his is its own game with fresh solid mechanics, they may take a bit to get down but once you **** are you a real ninja, Gliding, slashing and cloud stepping through the stages feels so good that i don't think you have to be reminded or know older games to enjoy this side scrolling plat former. the Messenger is so appealing to the eyes, This is art and great art, not simple pixel nostalgia. If you haven't played this gem i wont say much about the second half where a lot of reviews seem to think it loses its steam, but i would have to disagree. At this point your have to back track and explore to find hidden areas on the map and decipher prophecy to do this but in no way does it get boring, just a bit more challenging. I couldn't wait to open a new part of this world, to see it expand and i always felt rewarded when i did. The music in the Messenger was a treat! i don't get music from games stuck in my head all that often but it happens and oh did it with this on. i have actually turn on some of my favorite sections just to hear it the song while i did other things around the house! There is a lot that can be said about this game and has, so clearly my point outside of this The messenger being so good would be don't judge it by its style. this is a game im sure ill enjoy going back to time and time again over the years. Will you carry the scroll?.......... i did and cant wait to do it again.. This game has to be on everyone's must play list! Hands down this game is the absolute best game you will play in the retro 8 & 16 bit genre. Not since Shovel Knight has a game taken all the aspects we LOVE about old school games and improved them so vastly you didn't even know it was possible, while removing all the aspects that drove us nuts! Must play for sure do NOT skip this one!. Fantastic game — great controls and platforming, clever story and dialogue, and fun/challenging boss fights that don’t get frustrating. It’s also really funny and clever! The soundtrack is one of the best I’ve ever heard in a retro inspired game. Good length for the price too, around 12-16 hours. Don’t sleep on this The Messenger — not just one of the best indie games of 2018, but one of the best of 2018, period!. Overall, easily the best game i've played for years! Everything's top notch. Can't wait for The Messenger 2 !. The Messenger is the best indi game I have played so far and easily the best game of 2018.. The back tracking can be a little tedious, but I personally didn't mind it as it was a time well used to master all the abilities and upgrades. My biggest problem with the start of the game is there was just too much to the platforming. To cloud step you needed to strike an item and then jump, there was the grappling hook, and then the glide and","the Messager is a nice albeit average addition to anybody's platformer collection . gameplay wise I liked a handful of the levels and challenges but the controls and knockback made the experience cluncky . pixel art, music and sound are too oldschool for my taste ."
88.Company of Heroes,"Great RTS that every fan of the genre should have played. Still looks good today and is excellent to play.. I liked it but nothing more, real time quickly makes us lose the present action.I was disappointed.. Probally the best WW2 RTS game ever made The attention to detail and immersion is second to none ! 10/10. Game is too complicated. Games that are too complicated aren't so fun as they are unintuitive.. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 7.. Still playing in 2022! Because this is a Classic RTS that every gamer should experience!. One of the best RTS games ever and the best World War II game ever made. What an absolute unit.. ShawnD wrote ""This is up there with Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge as one of the best RTS games of all time"", then gave it a zero score.. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 84 IIIIIIIIII====================. Great game. Good graphics, sounds, atmosphere and pace. Still play it online from time to time.. artificial intelligence is completely broken. especially on maps with bridges. It is also broken on maps without a bridge. He can't get out of his territory. In artificial intelligence, all maps and all units are clear and visible. it knows the location of all your units. difficult artificial intelligence earns extra points. so it's a stupid game. also how not to russia? wtf. This is up there with Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge as one of the best RTS games of all time.. The best game in its genre. Very nice storytelling, pretty comfortable controls.. Without any shadow of a doubt, surely anyone reviewing this game positively in 2020 is doing so with rose-tinted nostalgia goggles? Back in 2006 it was a great game, compared to much of the other dross that was out there in the same genre. These days, it's clear as day just how bad this game is. Pathfinding is abysmal, troop and vehicles are often inclined to go every direction but the direction you actually want them to go. Snipers and other troops come out of cover by themselves, running into instant death instead of staying behind cover. Even when there's miles of space around an enemy tank, hey troops, why not run directly in its path and get squished instead... As for the AI, well, in this game that stands for Artificual Insanity. There's a complete lack of any intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Yup, it's fair to say that in reality (and this game is anything but realistic), CoH is actually crap.. A perfect game for any age, has few missions but each mission is very fun and not to mention the multiplayer epic battles!, I do not know why a person vote very negatively claiming this ""not realistic game"" ""Tanks with energy bars"" 1 there are no ""realistic games"" (in this case it would be ""war simulator"") 2 I prefer the ""energy bars""... than a simple medium tank can damage the caterpillars of the majestic tiger king. This game is not that good. Tanks shoot infantry and there is huge crater beneath them, yet they take 0 dmg. While they usually hit tank with anti tank launchers, even they don't much dmg. Tanks alone are useless later on against infantry... Even you can put units behind cover, who comes on top is usually decided by luck and than game snowballs from early game. It is not bad game, but not that great as well.. awesome ww2 RTS with DLCs its best RTS game i have ever played intresting campain,awesome multiplayer and great variety of units.. Company of Heroes is a real time strategy set in the Second World War. First of all, I have to say, even today, this game looks pretty damn good. Considering when it was released, the graphics is great. The level of destruction of the game's environment is just amazing. if you play a tough battle and spend an hour or two in one section of the map and then take a close look at it, you will see that what was a beautiful village or town before is now one big smoking ruin, with every single artillery shot leaving its mark on the face of the countryside. What makes it even greater is the realism of it. Take a look at a picture of WW1 / WW2 battlefield and you will see it looks very much like the game. I have never seen this level of destruction in a RTS game before or since. The story of the game is set in the days following the D-Day and it is pretty realistic. The realism of the combat itself had to be understandably sacrificed for the sake of gameplay, but it is pretty believable. I played the campaign on expert difficulty and even though I finished it, it was frankly too difficult for me. The AI as such is pretty bad and there are some pretty cheap and obvious exploits you can take in the campaign. Unsurprisingly this game does not contain any microtransactions or SJW crap. This game is a true gem and I am still playing it fifteen years later. Final Verdict: 93 %. it was good up until i discovered the fact that this game IS COMPLETE THRASH! what seemed like a rts with allot of potential gets ruined by the fact it's completely unbalanced, AI bugs ruin ALL my games vs expert as they seem to add increased accuracy TO ALL OF THEIR INFANTRY and my men look like **** with guns.. Fun game, but also somewhat limited and very simple game. Ok, to keep you engaged, but not memorable.. Company of Heroes released at a time when gaming pundits declared WWII games had overstayed their welcome. The formula had become tired they said. Enter CoH in the form of an RTS. Men in squads in CoH live and die by your command. It's your decisions that lead them to victory or defeat. More than any other RTS? You have to consider more than just army composition and unit type. You have hard counters to certain units like AT guns against tanks, etc. However the real beauty is the greater degree of tactical control you don't have in other RTS games. Flanking, combined arms tactics, supressing fire? They are all in place here. Is a MG gun pinning your troops down? Toss a grenade. Tank giving you problems? Try getting behind it to shoot at it's more vulnerable rear with another tank or infantry equipped with bazookas. You also have resource points to consider. Other RTS games have resources near your base. You then have to worry about building ancillary structures like farms (warcraft) or supply depots (starcraft) to increase your pop cap. That isn't quite how it works in CoH. You have to go into the field and capture munitions and fuel points which are vital to produce things like tanks. More importantly these points create a ""territory"" that has to be linked to keep your forces in supply. This opens up avenues for you to cut the enemy's supply lines or conversely them cutting yours. On top of that? COH has an incredibly robust physics and damage system. Almost any object on the map can be destroyed. The map itself can radically change by the end of the battle. It's incredibly immersive and why CoH stands as one of the crown jewels of the RTS genre even over it's sequel.. First WWII RTS game I ever played and it's still the best one :) From developers of Dawn of War series, which is also outstanding :) Visuals and sound design are still very good to this date.. Combat focused RTS exploring the tactical side of WWII. Mediocre campaign, great multiplayer.. Company of Heroes is a fantastic real time strategy World War II gaming experience, and one of the best RTS games I have ever played. The game is intense and engaging. In a detailed and realistic environment. Even if we consider a 2006 game, it is graphically excellent. The AI ​​is a bit annoying and with several inconsistent aspects. Sometimes very lame and too little ""intelligent"" and some others to smart, like for example how they always manage to hit targets with mortars but you can't do it in similar conditions. Overall, it is the fantastic game and I really appreciate all that time I spent playing it.. Not sure why this has such a high score. Chaotic campaigns, limited types of units. Producer kept milking this with new DLC's which adds more factions and more units but now I'm playing with the Germans and basically the trick they use is have multiple infantry types which do mostly the same, but build different things. Kinda weird and confusing. There's nothing tactical about it. Just the usual frantic-clicking, producing and shooting all over the place. The game is designed for the insta-gratification crowd. There's no high level strategy involved nor does it provide that much tactics either as you simply move in and shoot. Of course there's some tactics involved, as in finding cover, getting in buildings, getting behind cannons and stuff like that. But often the campaign doesn't give you even the chance to setup nice tactics. I've compared my style with those on YouTube and it's all the same; rush rush rush and shoot. Combine anti-infanty with anti-armor (there's some overlap too) and shoot. Mortars are almost useless (too inaccurate to depend on it), in multiplayer artillery isn't even built as it is equally useless. Only in one or the other scripted campaign scenario it has an occasional meaning. Game is overhyped and clearly targets the youngest tactical RTS crowd. Every mission in the campaigns is a repetition, albeit with slightly different units or faction. Some campaigns are broken: for example some might not allow you to finish a secondary objective which is chance based. Campaigns give you instructions by spoken words as if they were orders, but in the last campaign other screaming is generated as well, so I missed the tips and orders given to me because I couldn't understand it. But most of all, it's simply boring, repeating stuff.. One of the greatest RTS games ever made. Eschewing classic base-building, COH delivers tense tactical gameplay set in a mostly destructible map. Asymmetric maps and a strong online community make this one for the ages.. Still a healthy amount people playing in 2018, the mechanics and gameplay are just very well put together, there's nothing like it. I still from time to time come back to this game to play some classic 1v1 ranked games.. This and Great Battles of WWII Stalingrad are the best RTS games , compared to Coh2 , here you need to be smart and have excellent strategy to win, just buy it. Greatest RTS of all time, still standing almost 11 years after launch. Superb graphics, increidlbe sound design, destructible environment that actually impacts tactics, asymmetrical factions with very rich and complex tactics.... 1 – GENERAL Company of Heroes it's a RTS that plays on WWII scenario. I love to study and play games from this dark period of our history, so my impressions are always a bit biased in games like this one. This game was released in 2006 and it's impressive how a game almost 11 years old still holds on quite well. Graphics are still on par with today games, and just the cutscenes are already dated. Sounds were very well chosen and all the effects seem quite real, and the game it's quite immersive right from the start. The storyline is one of the best aspects of the game. Fortunately the usual plot of conquering a base and that's it does not happen here. Most of the time you have to secure a road, capture strategic points, prevent the enemy retreat. All missions seems alike with reality, and I love that. 2 – GAMEPLAY If you want to play the game properly then start by mapping your keyboard and do not play like me, only with mouse. Despite not being the most micromanagement related RTS, you still have a lot of actions to do at the same time. The fact that they never overwhelm you, giving you a lot of time to spend thinking only in the real action is perfect. In this game the resources are the strategic points scattered along the map. Each one of those with different values. Even if you capture a point you have to connect it to your base, or you will not receive that resource. Each mission is long and you are free to choose your approach. The mission briefing plays a major role here, saying the primary and secondary objectives that you should accomplish in each map. I've played the entire first campaign and it's respective missions and I have a blast doing it. My major issue in campaign mode is the behavior of the enemy AI. They seem to always choose defensive stance, and most of the times they will not endanger your base. Fortunately in skirmish mode that is different. Multiplayer is still active, and most of the players know what they are doing, so if you are new to the game you will probably have a hard time competing with them. 3 – CONCLUSION I am not a good RTS player, but I cannot stop loving this games. CoH is simply a joy to play. No bugs or glitches, full destroyable scenarios, a lot of units to choose from, a very well written storyline with lots of replay value. This game it's still great from today's standards. If you want to buy it, it's easy to find it on a sale, so just be patient and wait a bit.. At first the game seems amazing, but then you realise that the game stops in advancement and all you do is the same thing again and again. The game doesnt have enough units in both variety and numbers. Because of this the game feels like a demo instead of a full scale war game. Im a very careful player so i advance slowly. Therefore i lose very fiew soldiers so when im maxed out in units, the resorces becomes useless to me. And that kills at least one purpose of the game. I want to be able to defend more than two areas at once but i cant because how restricted the game is. It looks great, it sounds great but it is very shallow. Weapons and canons i pick up cant be dropped so there is no way i can get a fresh new assault squad unless i kill some of my other men. Its half fininshed with important game mechanics left out.. I picked this game a long time ago as a bundle with the DLC for cheap but that was probably the best money I've spent on a video game ever. The multiplayer balance was off at times but you were still able to find games without people abusing bs. Single player was great, yeah its not the most realistic WW2 game out there but imo it had a great balance between realism and gameplay. In all honesty I dont recall any RTS coming close to this title in terms of fun I had playing it, ever.... Company of Heroes, without a doubt is THE definition of an **** combines the excellent sound,visceral,nerve wracking gameplay of Call of Duty 2 with the overhead view of an RTS. The only problem ive had with it is that the system settings a bit too high for those with a low computer. I have a 1.7 Ghz,512 Dual RAM and 64 ATi Radeon Mobile 9200 and COH bogs down **** the gameplay is soooo good that the graphical problems are ALL forgotten. Company of Heroes,you dont own **** owns YOU!. Another RTS from Relic and another RTS that is different from Command & Conquer / Starcraft / Warcraft gameplay. It is similar to Dawn of War and Ground Control. Action is everywhere and graphics is very good even today, especially when you put in some texture mods and activate some effects by sweetFX and NVidia Detonator. The physics is great, one of the best I ve ever saw. The beginning is really 10/10, but... The setting is WW2 and again Normandy, Carentan, evil ****, hero USA... We had this settings 23d8rt3459d times and it is boring. And if you know Band of **** gets even more boring and just propaganda. In my view the gameplay is simple, there are not many different strategies, so the game is more **** reminds me a bit to World in Conflict, that is better in my view. In CoH are only few units, so after some missions the game starts to be boring. The KI is unrealistic, because they dont recapture the strategy points effectively, but it is good, otherwise every mission would take too much time. The KI cheats a bit, because it can view the whole map and go directly to the weak points. The UI is much too big too and I cant find any UI Mod. Surely not a great game. I have played a lot of RTS (Close Combat, Star Craft, Warcraft I-III, World in Conflict, to name a few), Company of Heroes is the most polished and innovative that I have played. As many have noted the graphics in this game are top notch. The frantic and non-stop action of the game requires a great deal of thought rewarding both the quick and the intelligent. If you enjoy RTS's, you will love this game. Company of Heroes is probably, (if not already considered), the greatest real-time strategy game of all-time. A must-play for any fan of the genre. Truly a masterpiece.. A jewel of an RTS. Easily one of the BEST ever made. both defense and offense and immensely fun, challenging, and intense. The community is so active, and helpful, especially for a game that's nearly 8 years old. The graphics are very good, the FPS is so smooth, the gameplay seamless, easy to learn and control. Each faction ( 4 in total with DLC, 2 in base game) grants unique units and abilities, and tactics you MUST follow to succeed in a battle. none of the factions play alike one another. Which brings me to my final in this review. This game never gets old. It is not repetitive. every battle is different. from where you set up, to when you go for a flank or an assault. I can't get enough of this game. And you won't either.. company of heroes is from the best games in the world it was at it age . I really recommend it very much its really a nice game and it become old but still people playing it and there is a 2nd game of it which its coh2.. I have been playing a lot of strategy games over the last 20 years- This is the best. Its a true strategy masterpiece that combines cerebral / work ethic output so well. The only game better was the short lived COH online which included insertion of special hand picked units If you don't have COH and COH Opposing fronts get it before it fades into non existence because this is as good as it gets.. A RTS style game that changes up the play field by using squads instead of units while playing. A Unique creative feature that fits in with the WW2 game. As a WW2 game the story is just what you would expect from the base of the game ( No DLC). Basically Band of Brothers in a video game format. Movement felt off as the units would fill in where they could and even though there was cover, they would be standing around getting picked off. Attacking other units was a confusing formula of are you going to hit? or how long will this take to end? Could have a squad of 4 targeted on 1 enemy solider in a open field and they would exchange gun fire for 30-45 seconds without hitting something. As a real time strategy game it was fun and challenging. When it comes to war themed RTS games I prefer Command and Conquer. Still playing this game, after almost 7 years. Wow, that really says something. This is by far my favourite game on my PC, and oldest. Stellar Campaign, fun multi player, various game modes, and decent DLC's. Great game.. Company of Heroes is one of the best RTS game in the world. its realistic graphics and system is very good until now. i'm still playing it in 2015!!!!!. As I stated in my Company of Heroes 2 this eschews good RTS for gratifying the Idiocracy wave of gamers. Getting rid of real resource management makes the game more similar to Men of War; except CoH (both of them) **** compared to MoW at the tactical level. The complete lack of realism in the game also is a buzzkiller for any WW2 fan. Had they done something similar to their Dawn of War RTS games (not that DoW RPG wannabe RTS crap=DoW2) then this might have been a decent series. This game is best left to the insta-gratification console generation. More and more games have been getting dumbed down and require little brains, this series is an example of that. There are far better games out there that require much more intelligence and provide real gameplay. I'm afraid with this game all hope is lost for real RTS games made for adults instead of teenagers.. Great game, determinately worth playing! The single player campaign is hard, but non unfair. High re-playability! I wish all single-player games were this good.. This game is amazing! Still playin' Autry and Hebecrevon Missions over and over and over again! Still playin' in 10/12/2014! 8 Years! Relic, amazing job!. Campaign somewhat a bore nothing new not challenging but the gameplay is just amazing, multiplayer is where its at. This game shines in multiplayer it's so challenging and strategical with quite a bit of options on how you want to build you're army and Graphics are ok nothing spectacular the physics are also nice. Very high replay value and super fun with friends or just competitive play. Best RTS plain and simple. Worth $50. Another average RTS game. It is a lot of fun until about level 3, where you will die again and again while wondering why your 4 riflemen can't defeat 10 tanks.. It's been 8 years since its release but everytime I want to find myself engulfed in WW2 asmosphere I still find this game one of the best choices. The campaign is well-written, the 2 armies are all-around balanced and the skirmish battles are nicely-done. Except for sometimes units engage each other in very very close quarter but they still keep shooting at each other, which is quite hilarious you would wonder why they won't stop shooting and go on melee mode all the way, but still... One of the best decisions I've ever made getting this game in 2006.. ITS MASTERPIECE. never seen better WW **** a complete game in every sense, filled with gripping combat , effect and lovely world... Still holds it position as best strategy..love this game.. Company of Heroes is the best video game that I have ever played, and in my opinion it is the chess of video gaming. I am still playing it regularly in 2014. It is an absolute shame that COHO- Company of Heroes Online, was cancelled in late beta, because it is the only thing going that could derail this juggernaut. A diamond. Stairway to Heaven. A golden retriever. A sexy lady. An object of man made perfection. COH also has the most graphic and realistic violence in the most ageless graphics of all war games. The voice acting, sound effects, and graphics are sublime. There is infinite depth in its complex array of play modes. Rest in Peace Brian Wood, you made the game to stand the test of time and honor its subject matter.. Best RTS i have ever played, and one of the best WW2 game also. Technically great from sounds to graphics. Something unseen before that. Game play now that's where it shines. I won't try to explay how it works, but simply said the tactics are what really matters, sure with huge amount of man power anyone can win a game, but what usually happens is someone who uses all those little things like cover, flanking, using strengts of every unit and so on. Just great RTS. PRO's: Gorgeous visuals with a competent game engine. A gorgeous soundtrack and brilliant sound design. A massive modding community that is still making original content for a game close to 8 years since its release. Varied factions that all play in remarkably different ways. Hundreds of strategies, different methods of play, a still active multiplayer community. The sequel drew back in old players after everyone realized how mediocre it was. Its Warhammer 40K on steroids and who doesn't like Warhammer? CON's: Their have been some pretty mind numbingly stupid patches made for the expansion. The expansions were not very good compared to the original. Some things are mostly fixed, but a lot is still broken since the attempt years ago was made to balance all the factions pretty much at once. Its starting to look a little long in the tooth visually. The multiplayer community is full of some pretty huge ego maniacal fellas that don't play nice with newer players. The automatches can be a dangerous breeding ground for contempt amongst those who are new to the game. The modding communities are always heading for different camps, with the intent of making the game more ""realistic"" or more ""balanced,"" but they never really settle on more ""fun."" Some of the concepts are so far removed from reality that some people might prefer entirely different games such as the ""Men of War"" games. Multiple scathing and somewhat stupid historical inaccuracies that should've never been in the game. Tank battles are more arcade-like than any tank battles from actual reality. If you were content enough with Warhammer 40K and those expansions- you may have already played this game for the most part- only without the World War II aesthetic or theme.. Amazing game that raised the bar for RTS. Great balance for multilayer with fun maps and multiple game modes one of which is a MOBA with WWII tanks! Sega will not update the matchmaking system which is sad because this game has better balance than CoH2.. I have played many an RTS in my life, and I must say, this is the best one by some distance! Recommend it and the expansions (Opposing Fronts, Tales of Valor) to any RTS lovers out there!. This is a fantastic real-time strategy game no one should miss. Impressive graphics that successfully portrays the brutality of battles is what i love most about the game, which simply makes me want to keep playing and playing it although it has been 4 years since i started enjoying the game. Great game, although I never got into the competitive multiplayer because I was busy with Age of Empires 3 at the time. The graphics, sounds and visual effects were just stunning and the combat feels very realistic. The online is still up and running and quite alive (through Steam) for anyone looking for a new RTS to play competitively.. Nothing...I mean absolutely Nothing comes close to this Brilliant and wonderfully creative RTS in our lifetime!! It's 2013 and there are more games coming out with unbelievable graphics and physics, but this is one truly GREAT war-time game trilogy that will NEVER be over-matched or overlooked FOREVER!!!. Don't get me wrong... this is a really well made game. Especially considering I write this review after 7 years of its release. It has however few annoying issues. First, the AI of your own troops is basically non-existing. Especially in fast-paced maps controlling every minor detail of your troops becomes simply frustrating. Also, the base building doesn't really fit well to this game. Fixed amount of troops plus triggered reinforcements would have worked better than some artificial troop limit that gets maxed out in worse possible times.. I think I might be one of the few people on the planet who doesn't think much of this. The strategy is workable. The campaign has an acceptable storyline, the graphics are ok. Everything about it screams, ""yeah, not bad"" to me. Ah well.. never mind.. The game is fascinating. I don't know if the Stormtrooper in reality, could camouflage like in the game. One can device many tactics for the various units. For instance, camouflage a sniper, and disable free fire. Then camouflage the Stormtrooper unit, or two Stormtrooper units with panzershrecks, and put them in a position, where they are behind the sniper, and have the sniper scout for the Stormtrooper units. The Stormtrooper units will fire the panzershrecks, beyond visual range, and in camouflage.. Best Strategy of ALL TIME!!! Bar-none. This is my favorite game of all time. It pains me that they have stopped updating it for it's lower, less-successful, less-enjoyable brother COH 2... This game is awesome and I still play online today Fall 2013. So what are you waiting for! Go buy this game on steam for super cheap and have a ton more fun than COH 2. They got it right the first time. Probably the Greatest RTS game of all time. Very addictive and very well made. I have enjoyed many hours of playing this awesome game. The online experience is excellent and the campaign is very good too. 10/10. I'm not a great strategy, but loving me is like CoH, beautiful graphics, great video transfer, a long campaign, smart opponents, can only praise is a great word. I recommend to everyone.. Graphics are great, maps are outstanding, many excellent features, and the multiplayer is AWESOME. This game COULD have been great all around. But you don't get an A+ for ""could have"". Why isn't it great? Because the computer AI is incredibly stupid, regardless of the difficulty, and cheats shamelessly and endlessly to make up for it's stupidity. It also has among THE WORST vehicle pathfinding of any RTS I've played. The AI tactical intelligence and vehicle pathfinding is literally no better than Starcraft 1. Yes, it's seriously that bad. This tells me that Relic was unwilling to spend the time to develop a genuinely intelligent AI to match the incredibly detailed and complex maps they built, because they didn't see the need to waste the man hours making the Single Player or Co-Op experience as good as the Multiplayer. Don't you DARE try to enjoy the single player campaign in this game. It's an utter exercise in frustration and misery until you finally realize WHY the enemy can dance through heavy machine gun fire, built multiple tanks at a time, and always has 2x (or 3x, or even 4x) the manpower points as you. It's because Relic made it that way, because they were too lazy to care.. Overrated. This game wants to be a RTS that emphasizes tactics and strategy, but ends up being more of a cleverly disguised spinoff of the Command & Conquer series than anything else. Don't get me wrong there are lots of cool ideas here, but none that really excel in the framework of the game. You have the ability to station troops behind walls or inside houses for cover; engineers can build sandbags, barbed wired fences or anti-tank blockades, and even plant landmines; you are given a variety of troop types from machine guns, snipers, basic infantry, down toward mortars for long range bombardments; and even an RPG like level up skill system based on experience gained. Heck, the game even adds an overhead tactical view as if to say, ""see this is more than your mindless send wave after wave of whatever type of unit you want and auto win."" All sounds really cool! However, it won't be long till you realize all these ""strategies"" are a waste of time and you'd be better off ignoring them and going back to the standard ""build tons of whatever units, group them all together into a giant blob, and just move around the map steamrolling the enemy."" The AI is dumb. Your troops are dumb. They require 24/7 babysitting with micromanagement intervention for every fight or they will just keel over and die at the mere sight of the enemy (even if you put your troops in superior cover positions). So attempting to tactically spread troops around the battlefield is not a worthwhile tactic. Attempting to move to a different area of the map away from your main army and build up some defenses with an engineer is not worthwhile. These things will just cause your troops to needlessly be lost and you finding yourself falling behind. The terrible zoomed in camera that makes the game feel like its 640x480 resolution from the 90's is just the extra kick in the balls for strategic gameplay. Company of Heroes manages to somehow actively punish you for attempting to play it tactically and rewards those who who don't. As for the battles they are cartoonish. Makes Call of Duty look like a hardcore combat sim. Infantry standing 2 feet from eachother unloading hundreds of rounds unable to kill eachother. Flank some enemy infantry and get them surrounded and pinned down. Easy kill right? Nope, the game has an infantile Retreat functionality that magically turns your troops into zombie-like super soldiers with tank like defensive buffs and cheetah like speed. Up they pop and safely run back to base to heal while surviving thousands of bullets being fired at them along the way. Is this a PC RTS or a RTS made for XBOX kiddies? Hard to tell sometimes. Its not a bad RTS, but its not a great one either. Certainly not the absurd ""Greatest RTS of all time"" taglines being thrown around. Have you people","i liked it but nothing more, real time quickly makes us lose the present action . this is a classic RTS game that every gamer should experience . this is up there with Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge as one of the best RTS games of all time ."
880.Resistance: Fall of Man,"A very unique and weird game where a soldier dies and gets revived by alien parasites that infest his body and keep him alive. He now has the ability to survive longer and heal part of his health bar when taking some damage. Yes, there is a health bar here. There are points this game is stingy with health but most of the time you don't have to fret. Also you get to carry every weapon in the game unlike its sequel which holds the traditional two weapon only system and no health bars. Overall, a solid origin story that has a simple yet effective execution gameplay and storywise.. One of the most beautiful, best and most enjoyable games I have ever played in my life. I hope it comes back again.. Resistance isn't a bad game but I would say it overstays it's welcome. The story, weapons, and atmosphere is all pretty interesting but even for 2006 mowing down an endless mob of enemies in each level with almost zero mission variety just becomes boring. If it wasn't for the interesting story it would be a 510, if you aren't interested in alternative history games then this one might be a skip for you.. This game is better than resistance 3 in every way such as destruction, physics, history, gameplay, violence but it only loses to 3 in one aspect which is the graphic. Whoever made this game forgot to put colors... The environments are all black and white. Resistance feels like some sort of trick that Isonamic tried to pull for seemingly no reason, the premise is interesting and the weapon mechanics really make the game, but it just takes itself way too serious to really be worth of much interest. Resistance certainly isn't a bad game, but if it were to take itself maybe a little lighter or make itself a little more over the top the game wouldn't feel as daunting as it does with it's long campaign and generic atmosphere.. I didn't buy this game initially, because the marketing didn't make it look appealing, or create a draw to it. In fact, it wasn't until I played & completed Resistance 2, when I finally bought this, as the ""greatest hits"" edition. This game, & the entire trilogy as a whole, was fantastic. Understanding, as a launch title, it was feeling its way around. A new story premise, although with a lot of the same FPS mechanics of the day, makes this game very solid. If you're late or absent from this series, it's definitely priced for a (re)visit, today.. A classic PS3 game this is one of the first come out on PS3 era its a unique style and ""old"" shooting system with a great mechanics,the story is told in the third person with an external narrator the A.I is very Phenomenal for his years.. Solid FPS that's a little linear, but a nice selection of inventive weaponry and an interesting scenario makes it a cut above the herd.. I guess I was too hyped for this game by reading all positive reviews from 2007... I was absolutely let down by almost everything in Resistance. But first things I liked: Setting - general idea of chimera war is brilliant. Guns - not all of them but most are fun. Design of early stages and design of enemies. Now beside those few good aspects, game is actually horrific... Gameplay loop is insanely boring you are doing the same thing for straight 11 hours without almost any twist of story or gameplay! Maybe if this game were 6 or 5 hours long it wouldn't be such bad experience... When the game is showing lack of creativity after first 3 missions and you've seen almost everything in terms of story telling, enemys, locations, guns and gameplay experiences it's hard to keep someone engaged for such a long time. Graphics is obscure and disgustingly blurry. Washed out colors, blurry textures and generic locations. It's really sad how this game is unplayable in 2023. And I will not even mention the controls. I can't really recommend this game to anyone. I would love to see a good remake of first Resistance, because in this state it's really hard to enjoy this game... As much as I wanted to love this game at first, I really hated it at the end.. This game is a mess. Every enemy is an annoying bullet sponge. The controls are horrible with minimal customization. This was painful to get through.. Easily considered to be the best launch title for PS3 with a awesome and intriguing story, a (at the time) fantastic online experience, and overall, a amazing launch game and for great reason.. I'm always salty about fall of man, but playing it and comparing it to the other games in the series is almost intolerable, however, it was still an amazing start to a franchise I love a lot. I enjoyed it, including the different modes it offered.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pros: +Story +Combat +Environments Cons: -Poor graphics -Poor sound design -Bad checkpoint system. love this game, the atmosphere gameplay everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Resistance: Fall of Man is a 2006 science-fiction first-person shooter video game for the PlayStation 3. It was developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony.. Well to start let me tell for the time according the release of the game it had stunning graphics for the time and that's to say it was a release title for the PS3,the story is ecxiting!! the playability is sweet and i like how it gets difficult by time and by being able to adjust it when starting the game and i love playing the Cooperative for it a lot.. Graphically outdated, the gameplay is slow. Some parts of the game are unnecessarily hard. The story is a BIT predictable. However as usual with Insomniac, weapons are fantastic and the design of the Chimera is awesome, they make for a memorable enemy, there was a LOT of wasted potential on how they could've presented them, where the story could've gone. Perhaps a remake would fix this? Whatever the flaws of this game may be, it, along with its two sequels still have the best cover arts EVER. This is a fun first person shooter game featuring various kinds of weapons, which provides flexible fighting strategy.. While it shows some of its age. Resistance is a fantastic classic PS3 title. The world is very interesting and becomes increasingly developed across the franchise. I would absolutely recommend.. Finally dusted off the PS3 and getting around to some games I missed during its prime. I enjoyed resistance fall of man. For its time the combat is enjoyable, weapons are very fun to use. The campaign story I have mixed thoughts I liked it, but it left me wanting more. One thing that slightly bothers me is they never patched a trophy list, as someone who enjoys trophy hunting I find that frustrating. Definitely a difficult game, if you don’t plan it’s going to mean a death, most likely even if you do plan you will die a decent amount of times. The checkpoints are very far along intervals, so it can be frustrating having to play the harder portions multiple times. I wouldn’t play it again, but it entertained me enough to play the rest of the series.. I'd give it a 7.5 five but i can't so i'm rounding down. The game has a fast gunplay kinda like doom but it has problems with the weapon variety. Out of the 7 or so weapons you'll use just 2 90% of the time because of the unviability of the other, either being too slow or just the lack of firepower. The setting is cool, 50's england in a war with the aliens. The plot is forgettable too, in a couple of years i'll forget everything about this game. But overall is fun. In general, this is an average FPS shooter. Graphics are little bit better than on the PS2, the physical engine is fine. The shooting mechanics very simple, each weapon has a primary and secondary shooting mode, a choice of 8 weapons, only 3-4 of them are really effective, the gameplay is very repetitive, in basically it's shoot and run, 2 times I was allowed to drive: car, tank and stalker (spider-like robot), with possibility to jump and squat, that's all, all the other time it's just shooting. Plot itself is interesting, its presentation is boring, cut scenes are minimal. Sometimes game is too hard due to lack of cover system with full recovery of HP, and all this against the high complexity of enemies, so you often need to play very save, which is not fun. After all, nothing special, I do not know how in 2006, but now it is not worth attention.. The game itself has the potential to be really good even with a lot of its flaws. The main problem comes in when you get to actually playing. The framerate is really bad, never going above 30 which is nowhere close to enough for a shooter especially and there is no mouse and keyboard support forcing you to play with a controller which is a horrendous method of playing an FPS. The worst part is that the game rarely accounts for these issues and many of the combat encounters are structured as if you have proper control which you can only dream of. Some of the combat encounters have the problem of putting enemies in a way where they can very often get cheap shots on you. It is just a huge shame, really. What the game does get right is the weapons. They are not perfect but you have a good mix of different weapons that fill different roles. Especially the Auger is interesting and engaging to use. The ammo balance isn't the best though so you will find yourself often being empty on some weapons for extended periods of time while walking over ammo pick ups that you have no space for with other weapons even if you use them during that time. I genuinely wonder why they put excessive amounts of shotgun ammo in wide open spaces as well. The vehicle sections don't feel very good either. It is surprising considering Insomniac have made some good side gameplay in their previous titles. I really want to love this game but whenever I go in for a hug, it knees me in the balls and that is just something I can not ignore. Lots of potential, shame they never brought the franchise to PC where this game could have turned out a lot better. Maybe the sequel will do better in the aspects that were not determined by the terribly unfitting choice of platform.. Resistance: Fall of Man evokes a twofold feeling, especially playing the game in 2020. This is the first decent PS3 exclusive. Here, even after so many years, gameplay is not bad and dynamic, but only in places. In general, the game itself on AAA-project does not pull in any way, here very simply the plot in the form of a slide show is submitted. Only couple of characters. The saddest thing about the game is balance. He 's hardly here. Points of preservation and appearance of opponents are scattered as if randomly. In general for the game of 2006 it is not bad, it is possible to pass. But Insomniac Games could do much better if the level of difficulty was easier (at the average level of difficulty it becomes almost impossible to play) and there was at least an autoregenation of the main character 's health.. A very cool FPS with a good lore, and a very effeicient gameplay. One of the best early games of the PS3.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Basically Halo for Playstation (3). Slightly reminiscent of Gears of War, because of it´s military/alien shooter theme. Britain is a weird setting, but it fits into the big picture. I understand why Resistence became a trilogy (+ handheld games) in the long run. There is something about the alien design and all that. The problem is that Fall of Man blends in with every other FPS you have played in your life, too well.. The game is not bad but loses a lot because of its control. You can not run, you can barely cover yourself, and the target accuracy is a disaster. Otherwise a normal story where the hero saves the world from an alien invasion. If you have 2 controllers and this game, you can feel sure you will enjoy the campaign in cooperative! Nobody expects that graphics in 2006, a total revolution in those days, oh my memories. A fresh concept in their days, the feeling of next gen game in 2006 oh, N O S T A L G I A. Resistance: Fall of Man is a science-fiction horror first-person shooter video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. + Split Screen Campaign + Multiplayer. Resistance: Fall of Man is a fun and entertaining FPS for the PS3. I really enjoyed the creepy atmosphere and environment that surrounds the games story. There is plenty of action, a wide variety of different settings, and impressive gameplay that still stands up years after its release. There is also a large collection of different weapons that have their own special abilities, making each one unique and useful throughout the levels. Overall, this is a very engaging game that draws you in with its amusing gameplay and story.. This is hands down one of the best ps3 games I have played so far, the story is excellent, the characters well developed and full of emotion, the graphics are crisp and have vairied amounts of colour, the character models look brilliant too, the ai is also good too, chimera jump in and out of cover and friendlies will do the same, the level design is good, the physics are brilliant, and the ps3 runs this game with barely any slowdown! considering this game came out in 2006 and was a launch title for the ps3, it looks and plays damn good even 9 years on, resistance is definitely the best thing that has been done with a ps3 cell processor, xbox 360 owners are missing out hard, definitely a must own for ps3 owners :). Awesome PS3 shooter that still stands up today. First played it in 2015 and the game still looks and functions incredibly compared to more modern games. A lengthy, high enjoyable single player campaign mixed with a super fun CO-OP mode makes this in my top 5 all-time favorite PS3 games and the best Resistance game to date.. this game is good shooter. while game playing, i always feel tense sense. but, for me, normal difficulty is too difficulty. so i have to many time retry.. Weird campaign,disappointing graphics,bad controls and a glitchy multiplayer are the reasons Resistance : Fall of Man is not that good **** have to give the game credit for the original and interesting story.. Meh. Repetitive, just another mindless shootemup. The story was interesting at first, but became stale as the story progresses. The weapons were meh, the enemies were meh. The gameplay was ok, but nothing special. The lack of online for resistance has stopped me from buying future iterations of this franchise. Shame, the online looks great from what I've seen on youtube, it would've saved this game from being below average and scored a 7 or even an 8 from me, but nope, no online.. I think I played this one too late, the voice acting and story felt very cheesy and the visuals were pretty bad too. I liked the premise of an alien attack during World War 2 and shooting around was a lot of fun (especially with a friend) for a while but things got boring pretty quickly for me.. If you want to play an original and traditional first person shooter though have a less outdated feel whilst playing, then Resistance: Fall of Man is for you. This game is hard...really hard, and enjoys to keep the action short and sweet, but with a huge bang. Resistance is a long game for its genre, and is full of collectibles and achievements which obtain skill points to unlock goodies such as concept art. While the M.P. may be gone forever, the offline M.P. and offline cooperative mode for campaign are both worth a purchase. Resistance: Fall of Man is one of the best first-person shooters of all time.. Story: 7 out of 10, Graphics: 8 out of 10, Fun: 8 out of 10, Controls: 7 out of 10, Ease to Learn: 7 out of 10, Length: 7 out of 10, Re-play: 7 out of 10, Value: 8 out of 10. I recently completed this game as of the end of 2013. Despite this being an old game, I had a lot of fun playing it. This series has the most unique weapons that are just fun to play with. The guns in other shooters are all the same, so this is a pleasant change of pace. I really got into the whole universe created here.. I always enjoy a good alternate universe story. The story was a little hard to follow though, and the game dragged on longer than it probably should have. Those are my only gripes with the game though.. All other aspects are well done including graphics and sound. Overall I highly recommend.. Good fps, has some character to it, looks more then decent and it's fun to use all the different weapons on the variety of enemies. I don't play a lof of fps's but this played well and the controls were good. I liked the healing system as well.. As no surprise developer Insomniac games crafted a flawless shooter incorporating an immersive world, tight and satisfying gunplay, exceptional writing, top notch voice acting, and enough creative weaponry to make Charlton Heston jealous. However, what does come as a surprise is that this game does not include Ratchet or a lovable robot sidekick named Clank nor does it support a lavishly comedic and cartoony overworld. This game is Resistance Fall of Man and it kicks serious human/alien hybrid butt! Hats off to Insomniac for having the versatility and skill to step outside their comfort zone of colorful characters and sarcastic one liners set in an E rated third person world to go with something a little more dark, a little more adult. In terms of setting and characters Resistance is the antithesis of Ratchet and Clank, it is a gloomy albeit spectacular setting splashed with a fittingly washed out color pallet of grey and greyer. The world is beautifully ugly with its war torn colorless version of alternate history WWII England. The art direction while mired by some wonderfully depicts the bleak desperateness of war with crumbling buildings, dilapidated 1940's cars lining the streets, and vicious alien hybrids snarling about. Yes, a wonderfully rendered and possibly the best alternate history WWII setting ever created. With a frighteningly scary and ferocious antagonist dubbed (the Chimera) an alien/human hybrid originating from a virus within the walls of a fictional Russia finally breaking out after a ten year incubation period and deadset on devouring europe. These fierce enemies are daunting and numerous while physically imposing they stand seven feet tall with claws and razor sharp teeth, all this with the adeptness to accurately shoot superior weaponry, organize, and sometimes even out think their opponents. The Chimera shine as an all time foe with advanced AI and a varied attack from flanking to simply rushing the opponent with the ferocity of an angry, drunken ex husband. These killing machines come in many different sub species each designed to excel in different areas offering a multitude of ways to kill you. You are the protagonist American soldier and soon to be legend Nathan Hale and you are a badass. Hale is a great character though a little stiff and lacking emotion those are likely traits one would need to survive in that hell. Early into the game a great plot twist arises as you become the sole survivor. Hale is supported in battle by a bastion of nondescript british soldiers who ultimately become human target practice. In contrast his allies shine in a feisty british army captain who teams with Hale in many of the games missions but the real star is Rachel Parker. As british intelligence Rachel Parker narrates the entirety of the game as if she is telling a vaunted story. With a beautifully accented voice and convincing dialogue she also appears in many cutscenes and steals the **** single player is paced well and comes in at a respectable ten plus hours with few huge boss fights but many mini boss fights. The combat is fast and aggressive and starkly different from Gears of War style fps's with much of the games cover at least semi destructable, and dont take cover behind cars for too long as they will eventually blow up. Surely Insomniac has influenced a generation of developers with the amazing weapon creativity and pure funness they are to weild with new deadlier and weirder guns which can only be found in multiple play throughs As well the game boasts a Ratchet e Clank type skill point system where you are rewarded for completing a variety of objectives from killing enemies with a certain gun to finding all 37 intel items to turning foes into meat **** also includes a 12 gun weapon wheel letting you carry a small armory with you which is needless to say awsome considering just how cool these weapons are, and you will need them all as they are all unique.This game is not a typical WWII fps or a sterile Halo game, it has realism and truly interesting subject matter unlike the steriod infused fun but rather ungripping tale that is Gears of War. It is more interesting than Call of Duty and has a MUCH better gun arsenal than any of them. Besides one gun in Gears of War all other AAA FPS guns pale in comparison to most of the Resistance guns. If you claim to be a ps3 fan it should have been a day1 buy. The multiplayer is solid and lag free and supports great perks as well as on or offline coop. 9.75/10 for originality and interesting subject matter, great innovative guns, satisfying art direction, great voice acting, tight gun play, fun skill point system, replayability, and well conceived multiplayer. This game is timeless and will hold up in any generation congrats to Insomniac for flipping the script on us and crafting a great new IP and creating a new fascinating world of fiction.. This game is funny and I mean that in its hard to think of the reason why its getting a 6/10. It has all the ideas for a great shooter and in many places it is and its alot of fun. The Chimera are a good enemy idea and can occasionally give you a jump plus the weapons are creative aswell. The story is ok but not brilliant but the biggest let down is probably just some sections of the game which are sort of boring I suppose. Nathan Hale isn't very interesting here and some levels aren't designed well. A good game but not brilliant. This was the first FPS i ever played. At that time i found it amazing. I will now give a honest review. So it is pretty much a basic shooter. You have a gun and have to move forward and shoot every alien there is in your way. And then there is some special levels where you have to control a tank. Or other things. You get new guns with new special abilities and you can carry all the guns. The story is the standard the aliens are taking over the world story and the person you play as have a strange connection to them that we all know so well. So what makes me give it a 7 out of 10? Well, the atmosphere is very good. In the game there is some levels where you are alone. And the dark corridors and creepy music fits the game very well at those points of the game... Actually the music and the atmospher just fits the game in general. And the enemy variation is great. I loved and still love how there suddenly comes a new enemy out you've never seen before and have to kill. There was some awesome scary moments where some slow enemys could come up behind you and jump in your face. But i did also feel that there was to few if them. One of the things i loved most of the game was that there was a coop mode. So you could play the cool campaing with one of your friends. There is also a multiplayer mode but it is not really that good. It was just to out dated. But i did love playing vs mode with my friends. Pretty much multiplayer just only with you and your friends.. 10-Presentation; The plot, setting, and characters are a success. 10-Graphics; The art style may lack variety, but everything is so well done. 8.5-Sound; Music is hit or miss, but the voice acting and sound effects are excellent. 10-Game play; The levels, controls, mechanics, and AI are excellent. 10-Lasting value; There's co-op, 16 hour campaign, 40 player multiplayer, tons of weapons and modes, and tons to unlock. Overall-10/10. Short version: one of the greatest games of all time! Long version: The alternate-history storyline was really good and imaginative, and the color palette really made me feel like I was in WW2-era Europe. The weapons were a great mix of realistic and over-the-top sci-fi, and great fun to shoot. The enemy designs were awesome, and the level design was greatly varied to keep things interesting: some were very battle-action-oriented, and others were more creepy and tense. Then the developers made a great game into a super-awesome game by including unlimited weapons, vehicle segments, health packs, split-screen co-op (rare these days), and 4-way split-screen multiplayer (ultra-rare). And the soundtrack is excellent and fits the game perfectly with its militaristic sci-fi vibe! This is the game that got me back into FPS gaming.. Pretty generic and can be a little frustrating at times but overall it's a pretty decent experience. Graphics shine when in and around chimera structures, otherwise, they can look pretty bland and ugly. Guns are the highlight of this game and enemy AI are surprisingly smart. At a 8$ price tag, i recommend it.. This game was decent, it has no unique story, no special weapons, no cool cut scenes, no great graphics, no nothing special. Seriously, it is not a good game nor a bad one. If you can, just rent the game, finish it and return it. It is short.. 8.5 - Resistance is a fine FPS with a wonderful sense of scope. Playing for the first time almost 6 years after it's release, I finally understand the excitement revolving around the game. Great voice acting, fair character animations, and an intriguing (if unexplored) world and fiction. A fairly strong sense of pacing keeps this game from getting too dull, as some parts remind of the great Half Life 2. The incredible, versatile, and creative arsenal that you have at your disposal is a blast to play around with. Resistance truly gives the player tools of destruction to blast quickly through hoards of enemies, making each encounter blisteringly fast paced instead of a dull and boring. The most commendable feature of Resistance is the art direction. Aside from the surprisingly sharp graphics (that trump some games of today), the looming Chimeran structures in the distance and the incredible amounts of detail gone into the creatures and world itself is truly astounding. Browns, greys, and blacks fill the color pallet, but I only feel that this is frowned upon due to playing so many other ""brown FPS"" games in recent years. Insomniac has some brilliantly creative minds. There are times when Resistance begins to tear at the seams, and difficulty spikes near the end prove frustrating and cheap, but Resistance: Fall of Man is a highly polished and exciting FPS that delivers all the intensity, intrigue, and chaos of a top tier FPS. And it's so cheap now, it's almost a crime not to give it a try!. This game was okay ,nothing special.. This game was decent. Fun, but not very appealing. When it first came out it seemed pretty cool, then slowly grew boring and dull. Story just seemed disappointing. Wouldn't recommend it.. Even though this game is six years old it still manages to hold it's own against other newer shooters, and that's saying a lot, the graphics do show age but the sound design is still fantastic, and the controls are tight and feel great, you can still find matches online but honestly I didn't find the multiplayer all that enjoyable but hey at least it's still got it, and the fact that people still play it says something about how popular **** this is, the best part of the game and the reason you should buy this is for the phenomenal campaign, while the story or characters aren't all that interesting or great, the set pieces are, and it reminds me of older shooters like Doom 3 in the way it manages to be a challenge without ever really feeling overly difficult, maybe a little frustrating in one or two parts but it never felt like the game was trying to work against me, and it helps that they give you one of the best FPS arsenals of all time, and checkpoints are generally very forgiving, especially seeing as how you get full health after you respawn at a checkpoint, and it includes two player local co-op, and new weapons are unlocked after you beat the campaign so that adds reason to play through it twice just to try out the new toys, honestly if your a fan of good challenging shooters then this is a must buy, I highly recommend.. This game is definitely one of the best fps games I've ever played. Right up there with Halo,Bioshock,Doom, and Medal of honor witch are my favorite fps franchises. Resistance has a huge place in history. Despite graphics not at its best. It was a great game.. Great game, however it borrows some ideas from half-life. Not a bad thing, because half-life is great, as is half-life 2. This game is fun to play with lots of interesting enemies and weapons. The mulitplayer is fun but it is fairly generic. Co-op is good, but not top notch and is only good for 1 playthrough. Lack of motion controls hinders you from experiencing the intensity of the firefights, and lack of trophy support gives it slightly less replay value.. Game is pretty darn good. One of the exclusives that PS3 fanboys got to get. What else can I say about this game? A lot. Like what? Well, to make an essay short. This game offers the creeps and the humor. It doesn't care whether the jokes or scare factors are uncalled for, it'll give you the run of your life. Look back on it, say you enjoyed it and move on to the next level. Amazing. You cannot give this game a shrug because you will regret it. The multiplayer is a blast! I repeat, a blast! Since its on the PS3's online network, which consists of a much more mature and grown-up audience, not to mention most Resistance players derive from Europe, there are no trollers. And we all hate trolls, whether you are a troll yourself or not. The campaign and multiplayer is a dual combo that will leave you playing this game for weeks. Maybe months. Maybe years, well that is until its sequel comes out. Until then, this game is the game to play!. Granted, this is a launch title and it's now 2011, and we've been spoiled with call of duty and the like, but I found this to be worthy of a 5/10. I won't hate on the story, its the reason I bought it, I love the alternate history stuff. Its the GAMEPLAY. Horrible. Felt cartoonish, slow moving enemy bullets, poor AI animation, useless friendly AI. At no point did I get **** in, the gunplay was too bad. In COD or nearly any other fps, you get **** in and forget you're holding a controller. Not here. Ruined a good idea with a VERY mediocre game. :-[ I will play through the rest to play the sequels because I love the idea of this universe so much. Hope the sequels are better. MUCH better.. Auger is the worst weapon idea ever created. Everything about this game (story, gameplay, graphics, sounds/music) felt dated and poorly done even for 2006.. Can't stand this game. It has co-op, sure. But waiting THIRTY seconds to respawn?? Come-on... And why doesn't health regenerate EVER? Even on easy this game is extremely hard. Probably harder than any other game on PS3 and I have a lot of games.. Graphics are ok but overall game seems repetitive. AI is a joke, not a great game I guess. Played just the demo though. However, I'll definitely sequel seems much better. Maybe I'll buy the special edition that comes with both games just in case, apparently multiplayer is awesome.... ya right!. In my fun factor, Resistance is like a rival for Gears of War, i had fun but not blown away. The story is nice, the arsenal weapons are in a large scale. Strong title for the PS3 and also the Halo for the PS3, i;m happy that Sony created a good rival.. Good concept and storyline but it's a case of been there done that. Nothing new in this game to separate it from the rest. Worth a play through but wouldn't be going back for more.. I played this game for the first time in 2011 and i find it still to be one of the best games on the ps3. Users who play this after the likes ","a soldier dies and gets revived by alien parasites that infest his body and keep him alive . you get to carry every weapon in the game unlike its sequel which holds the traditional two weapon only system . overall, a solid origin story that has a simple yet effective execution gameplay and storywise ."
881.Boom Blox Bash Party,"So much levels create a lot replay ability to the game. Lots of mini-games add to the grind of 100%-ing the game. One of my favorite party games to play with friends.. To me, it had the same magic that the original Boom Blox brought to the table. It's a shame these games were never truly noticed. An innovative game design that brought not only hours of fun, but a surprisingly well made level creator.. One of the funnest games of all time. Though having no point but to smash random blocks and score the most points out of everyone, The game just gets better and better. I love it. A+. This should be held up as a model sequel. It builds on all the strengths of the previous installment, and adds more to do and see. I love the creator engine they've got in here; if you're creative, you can make some pretty wild stuff. Tons of fun.. Tedious and extremely repetitive take on ""Crush the Castle,"" which itself is pretty tedious. Gameplay attempts variety, and while it gets different flavors, it's all still ice cream. Really bad ice cream with drawn-out physics. More than ""Crush the Castle,"" I think this game could be compared to a mini-game in WW:Smooth Moves, except instead of hundreds of entirely new novel concepts and fun, it's just a slightly different take on the same mini-game over and over and over.","this should be held up as a model sequel . it builds on all the strengths of the previous installment, and adds more to do and see . Tedious and extremely repetitive take on ""Crush the Castle"""
882.Kentucky Route Zero,"Personally I don't get why this so critically acclaimed. It's not really a game at all. It's a visual novel with some point and click aspects. The plot isn't that great, doesn't go anywhere or have much of a coherent story. Yes you could spend about an hour thinking about the meaning of it afterwards, but that's not really what gaming is about. The devs behind the game are art students, who were clearly more interested in making something that should be an arthouse film than a game. It's not unplayable or the worst thing out there but I just don't get the critics who believe this is the best thing ever.. If the art relies too much on the viewer to interpret its meaning, it is too subjective, therefore becomes empty and shallow.. First off, this is not a game. It's an interactive novel. There is no skill, or luck, or strategy. There's certainly no goals to achieve — which is very much the point. This is a story about people whose lives have been deprived of purpose by the corporate takeover and deindustrialization of the rural American south. It's a southern Gothic magic realist ghost story in which the characters do find a semblance of meaning and community in their broken lives, but not in the ways they expect. I think the experience is enhanced if you go in knowing that Conway will never make that delivery which is the game's inciting incident, that none of the characters will find what they are nominally looking for, and that relationships and authenticity matter far, far more than extrinsic goals. Video games are often fantasies of control but this is very much a story about finding meaning in a world that we cannot control, a world that has left us behind. It didn't totally work for me; I found it a bit too surreal and elliptical to be really emotionally resonant. The sudden shifts of setting and the introductions of whole new casts of characters from one chapter to the next threw me off. But the world that it conjures still lingers in my memory three years later and I might even replay it one day.. Inconsequential, drab, and unsubstantial story that hopes people will misread its disorganized ramblings as something deeper that it is.. I can't say that I understand all the hype about this game. For being an interactive narrative (""walking simulator""), there's no coherent plot to speak of, and the vast majority of it is stream-of-consciousness rambling that makes no sense at all. Along the journey of these poorly-established characters, expect to deal with scenes revolving around the life cycles of bats, extinct Pueblo peoples, whiskey factories, feral horses, incomplete text-based video games, arcane phone help lines, a modern art exhibit, an incredibly long and boring scene from a play, a small restaurant's unusual menu, and more. None of it connects to anything. None of it makes sense. The ""story"" has no real ending, the characters have no real resolution. Your choices are, of course, meaningless. Even the art is crude and low-poly. There's some good voice acting, though. If you're into trippy art experiments that you have to work to find meaning in, you may enjoy this. I did not.. Who ever says the game is boring, then this is not for you. I guess this isn't your tastes in game. The game is a journey. A journey which we create ourselves. People with the taste for a minimalist story telling will enjoy it. If you want something else, buy that rather than berating all the negativity which you couldn't enjoy. The game has its beauty. If you don't like it, don't buy it then.. Choices don't matter, there are no mechanics that make it a 'game', and the characters are mostly boring and uninteresting. Most of the early reviews really loved the first two Acts, but the only thing that they had going for them was that they were short. The first thing that I would call a plot point doesn't happen until chapter 3, and even then is pretty weak. Ugh. I finished this game, and regret wasting my time. Watch the Zero Punctuation review, I did after I played it, and my feelings were aptly summed up there. Avoid.. An absolute slog to get through and way too artsy for me. I would rather read a good book. While I understood most of the themes the characters did not do it for me. You really have to be in synch with the writers to get something out of this and I clearly wasn't.. metacritic wont update my score unless i type something out apparently. Very annoying. The game is also overrated, go read books.. Ultimately, a waste of time. Incoherent. boring. wall-of-text red herring ramblings with minimal playability or plot. Suffered through it only to find out nothing got solved in the end. Avoid if you like games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is more of a semi-interactive cartoon than an adventure game. There's nothing to solve, the texts go on forever, dialogs are more often than not just boring and/or plain absurd and the story is apparently envisioned as a Twin Peaks meets Inside but falls far short of both aforementioned franchises respectively. What is it about? Everything and nothing. There's no real plot. It's just as if the creators had no real script and were making it all up as they went along. Or better: as if they put their weird dreams on the paper and turned that confusion and nonsense into a motion picture which they then improperly christened as ""the game"". The execution of such surreal ideas really puts developers' immaturity into perspective. The product is nice-looking, the atmosphere is captivating but is wasted on the very basic interaction with it and , for most of the time, lines and lines of pointless and off-putting text. I suppose the game works better if you're high. In other case, however, I cannot recommend it.. nice and good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Starts of great with the atmosphere and suggestion of possibilities and sense of mystery. However it only gets more whimsical and ""mysterious"" until I definitely stopped caring. I would say it is worth playing until the performance in the bar. Of course if you get that far you won't be satisfied that nothing is resolved... but nothing won't be later either. It is a commendable game for doing something different. Kentucky Route Zero is a boring animated comic book. Although the graphic design is appealing, the most interesting thing in the story is to discuss with the dog Homer... Nothing to solve and the interaction is basic.. I can't recommend this as a game because it's more of an animated comic book. And I'm also not too impressed by the comic that is slowly unfolding. While I love the visuals and the atmosphere, both seemed increasingly wasted. Wasted on yet another narrative that is very keen to dazzle me by playing hide and seek, being oh so intricate and filled with heavy metaphors that it will find it's usual audience among the easily impressed. And while there might be an actual Jesus on this toast that some can see while most people only pretend to spot him, I stopped being intrigued to find whatever Cardboard Computer was burying with their equally sophisticated, but mundane dialogue and plot. There are no actual conversations, only people monologuing in turns, and most of the time I get the feeling that I'm listening to the writer trying to figure out what the hell is going on and where all of this is going, just like the reader. There are however a lot of beautiful moments to be found, and even when I'd given up on the story itself, entering a new scene was always exciting because of the visuals. I'd recommend it for the art, if nothing else, so if you are looking at some screenshots of the game and don't feel at least a little enchanted, you should give this one a pass.. Playing Kentucky Route Zero makes me feel like I'm back in high school reading a book no human actually wants to read and I'm expected to write an essay afterwards on the actual meaning. In this case I'm not so sure there is a deeper meaning. Kentucky Route Zero stays intriguing after the first chapter, falls off a bit during the second and third chapters then quickly loses any semblance of a coherent story. If I hadn't known it was such a short game I would have abandoned it after the first couple of hours. As it was, I struggled to have the desire to finish it. Date Completed: 2020-02-27 Playtime: 7h (feel asleep while playing a few times) Enjoyment: 1/10 Recommendation: Please, no, don't.. the whole act together is quite strange and if you dont like too much abstract concepts then this game is not really for you. the second to third acts are all very surreal and strange specially when you reach the end of an abandoned mine with people and a funky computer living in it. till the end of act iv till act v which is a lot more than other acts combined together the story unveils and you are still left wondering what went on about. a good game with a rather weird story but worth it.. I had first heard about this quirky game called Kentucky Route Zero a couple years after the first episode came out. I don’t like playing my games spread out like that so I decided to wait until the whole game was finished and to binge it then. Luckily I got the game for a good price in the mean time and years later I was able to complete it from start to finish without waiting. One thing I am not too worried about is spoiling the plot to Kentucky Route Zero because truth be told I’m not sure I really know what it is. Do you like games that make sense ? Well this one doesn’t. That may sound like a slur or insult but I look at this game as the closest thing to a video game made by David Lynch or David Chronenberg as I have ever played. I may have not always understood why what was happening was happening but I couldn’t look away and was immersed all the same. The characters are interesting, the locations full of lore and detail; the soundtrack awesome; and the story so odd that I am almost glad the strangest bits went without explanation because it may have ruined it. You begin the game as a delivery man who is trying to find an address he has never heard of. He gets pointed to a route called the “Route Zero” and directions to someone who can guide him to it. From there begins the strange journey where you will slowly add more and more people to your group all with their own stories to be told. In travelling this mystical route you will fly on the back of an eagle; find an underground computer to play a video game within a video game that is kept by people who have a giant fire they keep going; discover some of the most realistic government buracracy I have seen and much much more. At different points of the story you will have dialogue options in terms of not just what you say but who says it. You can kind of tailor the story based on who you want to follow and interact with although I am not sure just how much control over things this gives you or how it branches the main story. The game is like a combo of a 2D adventure game and a visual novel. You take control of different characters at different times depending on the parts of the story. There are no puzzles to solve; no enemies to defeat; I am sure some will say no real “gameplay”. I’m sure that there are those out there that will appreciate the game for what it is: a wild ride that has a very entertaining plot. The graphics are a weird mix of a low detail with a good art style. The audio to the game is great, the soundtrack setting the mood very well. There is no voice acting aside from a couple parts where you’re watching video or listening to answering machine messages but I didn’t mind this. I played Kentucky Route Zero on Linux. It never crashed on me once. There was one bug where when you are playing as a cat going around listening to peoples stories and meowing at them to get more details I had to check out a hole and the cat wouldn’t exit the hole making me reload the scene after which the cat would exit. Yes you play as a cat in one part, told you this game was odd. There were no graphics options at all to tinker with aside from choosing “modern or classic”. That simply ages the game back to the pixel era or keeps a more modern style. Alt-Tab didn’t work. The game doesn’t have a manual save option. It seemed to auto save at the end of each scene. There are three save slots but only one per playthrough so three people can be playing their own seperate saves but you can’t have more than one save slot for your game. During play the game used 14-85% of my GPU; 391-413MB of VRAM; 18-22% of my CPU; and 1.8-2.2GB of RAM. The game used up 2GB of disk space. Kentucky Route Zero was an experience I won’t soon forget. If you enjoy TV shows like Twin Peaks; movies like Videodrome; or games like Oxenfree or Night in the Woods then you will probably enjoy this. There were points that were a little slow paced but overall the game started strong and ended strong. It kept me wanting to know more and to know what the game would introduce next which is something many games these days fail to achieve. My Score: 8/10 My Sytem: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 580 8GB Gaming X | Mesa 19.3.3 | Samsung 850 Evo 250GB | Manjaro 18.1.5 | Mate 1.22.3 | Kernel 5.5.2-1-MANJARO. Very special, dreamlike and artful game centered around dialogue. You choose what your character says, but pretty quickly it becomes apparent that your choices does not affect the game outcome in any shape or form. The only thing you really choose is your own poetry, your own inner narrative. You have no control over where the game takes you. I found this absolutely fascinating and thought it elevated the game to greater heights. It's beautifully done. This game is for dreamers enjoying a mystery that maybe never will make sense.. If reading is really nessecary then I'll read some books rather than getting blinded by this boring nonesence. I don't see any future for this bla bla.. Incredible waltz into an eerie world of magical realism. A game of tremendous atmosphere and almost theatrical set design. The scene when Junebug begins his set in the dive bar is one of my most treasured moments in gaming. KRZ is not a game for button mashers, but for for players who want a thoughtful, compelling experience.. Even though I have only played the first two acts, I have to say that Kentucky Route Zero is one of the most wonderful gaming experiences I've ever had. Apparently a point-and-click graphic adventure, this is actually much closer to an interactive graphic novel. It's really good literature, or art, or however you may categorize it. Obviously, though, the ""game"" dimension is only the method used to put the player in the middle of the story. The difficulty is trivial, and it consists merely in finding the way through the different locations on the map and sorting out the meaning of the quest, which is but an excuse for a compelling story about lonliness, frailty and oblivion. Now, about the script: it's more than excellent, it's really over the scale. Whoever has written the texts in this game has obviously read a lot and written a lot, and knows who Don Delillo or Faulkner are. Very often the choice of dialogues does not have any consequence on the development of the story --- it's just meant to let the player co-author the story, add and choose the details that frame the main characters. You won't like this game if you're looking for shiny entertainment and action, for real-time emotions where you can prove your gaming stamina. You will love this game if you enjoy art, design, reading a good story, and obviously if adventure games were your favorite genre. It's very hard to explain how fabulously original, simple, light and complex is the graphic aspect of this game. The map interface is a great idea and the medium by which minigames find their right place into the game, creating a spiraling sensation that destroys the common notion of space as the story approaches the zero. Slowly, also the environments lose features of reality and represent in a fascinating way the tricks of immagination, irrationality, oblivion and selflessness. Just play the game, you won't ever forget it. Especially if you like good literature and contemporary art & design!","the plot isn't that great, doesn't go anywhere or has much of a coherent story . if the art relies too much on the viewer to interpret its meaning, it becomes empty and shallow . it's a southern Gothic magic realist ghost story about people whose lives have been deprived of purpose ."
883.Diablo IV,"Devs can't even do base mat. The new class brain farts on everything to the point it was bugged and abusable. Story is lacky, there is no content and depth. Blizzard should just give up and retire.. Turned out to be a great game! The atmosphere, details and graphics are stunning. Visual effects as well. Neat sound design. The narrative is pretty good. Although the story itself feels weak and doesn't end well. Feels the desire of Blizzard to **** on some money through future DLCs. But overall it's a huge game with a well-thought endgame phase. It's just hard to stay in the grind for a long time. This game better be played occasionally once you've finished all the quests.. An extremely boring and repetitive game. Basically, the entire game boils down to mindlessly pressing all the buttons and watching the enemies die. The story is vague and poorly developed, as is the endgame, which consists of killing giant bosses without any challenge, collaboration with other players, or any incentive. The online mode is completely useless. On top of that, practically everything can be obtained through microtransactions in the store (Isn’t paying €70 for the game enough?). Don’t waste your time. There are hundreds of better games to invest your precious time in.. Even though you say it's not good enough, it's my game. I love it. Diablo will never die. It's everything to me in my youth memories, no matter which generation it is, I will always only play the latest Diablo.. I’m not sure what I might be missing, but I find this game terribly boring.. You can just dsband. With so much money you are smashed by GGG and POE 2. Blizzard is worthless company. How did they have managed to ruin this so terribly? it was a simple task. Diablo 3 has a lot more depth than this and also is very fast paced. This game has many flaws but the most terrible is the map. The dungeons. The missions. While the graphics is good, the big open world map where you will spend the most time is the same anywhere you are. There are some variations of texture/assets/tiles but it's the same map anywhere you are. The same labyrinth where you get stuck while you run on the totally unnecessary mount. Blizzard created a problem to sell a solution. Has created a big useless map and starting to sell mounts to move faster in the empty map. Remember when the map was generated randomly? remember the mystery of the exploration? remember when you could dive deep into cool places and explore to find treasures? they are all gone.. The early game is fun, albeit rather easy and casual. A decent enough experience. But after beating the game and one progresses on to higher lvl's (60+) the game just becomes so bland and boring. Itemization ****, compared to previous titles. There are only a few possible character builds with each class, so the desire to experiment is simply not there. Clearly made for mass appeal and casuals.. gmae is amazing but blizz is trash per usual................................... The game is extremely easy and you cant pick harder difficulties before you have completed the story. This is insanely stupid and bad. Enemies dont really differ from eachother and all locations have exactly the same enemies roaming around. Diablo 3 atleast had different places and unique enemies in them.. Just disappointing gameplay. Ontop of that, it's just an absolutely evil company. 2 points for nostalgic reasons. Its another POE-LIKE GAME but really boring. I played for free in XBOX Pass - and thanks Blizzard - i know i wont buy it. It is waste of time / money. Builds, items, gameplay - just boring (dont agree? - just try poe). Dont even near playable as Path of **** even mentioning poe2 which destroy this diablo version. You wasted your potential/time/money blizzard. Im watching into past - what have you done in theese years? Diablo 3...immortal (?!) and now 4...ehhh...i have such high hopes and expectations but reality just destroy them... In past games only one GOOD sequel is SC2 (not mentioning some WoW).. Game is a copy and paste horrible game the classes are terrible the bosses are way to easy the skill tree is a complete joke the skills are boring the magic is always the same no endgame content at all what a waste of my money will never buy a blizzard game again. First of all, softcore players opinion does not count. This is an outstandignly good game! All bad reviews are from poor-quality PoE enjoyers, and also by bots. 0/10 reviews are irrelevant. This game has everything now, of course, maybe it had a bad start, but now it's a solid 10/10. Not a single one (diabloid) will ever come to Diablo awesomness. Vibes, set, setting, combat, mechanics. If you like Diablo - play this.. Just like POE, but deeper and more exciting! Thank you Blizzard for keeping standards high after so many years!. This game is the image of a company in total decline due to corporate greed. Story mode is garbage, with an uninteristing story diluted to the extreme with escort quests and unskippable dialogs. Thankfully it's skippable on alts. Then the endgame has basically 3 activities (plus variations): open world, bosses, and plain old dungeon. Open world is pointless. MMORPG mechanichs fit ARPGs like pineapple on pizza. Any activity ends in milliseconds as people with torment 20 gear are put together with people leveling. Those leveling will get one shotted seemely at random, and the dev still refuse to add a combat log to at least try to make sense of it. Bosses are a joke: they one shot regardless of gear; in theory you have to watch the visual cue before attack, except that in the middle of the mess they are absolutely invisible! I really wonder who the hell enjoy these encounters. Then there are plain old dungeons. Same usual stuff - except for some reason can't help feeling bored running them. The game brings you to play at a difficulty level where you can clear fast (or else it's not efficient), and that means there is no sense of danger. With that, boredoom kicks really fast, especially running always the same build. And once you hit high torment levels you cannot change build anymore. Re-rolling is a pain, especially the first 20-30 levels. I played casually two weeks and I'm already feed up. If you are looking for a good ARPG made with passion, look elsewhere.. Diablo's latest installment has clearly taken inspiration from Path of Exile, with its complex skill systems, darker tone, and focus on loot-driven progression. While the game retains the core of what fans love about the exile likes genre—action-packed combat and an immersive, gothic world—it feels like it's following in the footsteps of its competition more than ever before. Making it a notable installment in the exile like genre.. Bland and oversimplified. D2 remains last real diablo. The skill tree is thin boring. The combat feels deflated there is almost no moment to moment satisfaction. The Bosses have almost no mechanics and the only ""difficult"" bosses are just one shot mechanics not an mechs with depth. The bosses don't have any unique rewards. The world bosses are meaningless cause they die in 3 seconds. The open world format doesn,t feel good in an arpg imo it makes the world feel empty and lacks the character of the more handcrafted and diverse areas of a traditonal arpg. Go play POE and when POE 2 comes out go play that Diablo is dead. This game is, ti be polite, soooo uninteresting, unengaging, unfunny, all those adjectivesof joy with the un word before. I played the entire campaign to see if it got any better, it didn't, plain story, go from A to B, kill mobs, bla bla, go from A to B, bla bla, and so on. The story is not interesting, the voice acting is plain and boring, Lilith story could have been so good, but its not. First time i wont even buy the expansions.. Why dlc class is not available for base game users. Very bad marketing strategy. Also, tired of getting killed from barbs and druids in pvp zones. I only play as Sorcerer. And I want to feel little bit more powerful, and kill at least 1 of 10 players.. I tried it via game Pass 1. **** Client is absolute garbage and logs me out every time it starts 2. The game started and I thought it's a mobile free-to-play title with all the ""buy here"" windows popping up. 3. For some reason I had to wait for a server login. 4. After a quick character creation, I was put onto a town square and I had absolutely no idea why and what to do. 5. I tried to walk around and find the main quest but the game lagged for a second every few steps. 6. Uninstall 1 Point because it didn't crash during my 5 minute playtime and because it was more or less ""free"" for me.. I played Diablo 4 when it launched on Steam. So many of the problems of the game have been corrected. The story is interesting and certainly brought more depth to Diablo. From time to time, some side quest were really good, but there was a lot of rinse and repeat too. That said, the combat was excellent, and in opposition to some, I like the auto adjust difficulty level of the enemies. The sounds were great, the music to. I played with a controller and the UI was easy enough. The loot was fine, but everything that was on sales by NPC was kind of useless. You can buy cosmetic stuff, not my thing. And PvP mutlplayer doesn't interest me at all, so I can't review that. I give the game 88%. I played for 75 hours to do 100% main quests, and around 85% of side quests, the main game alone.. it is an easy and light version of diablo. Same that happened to D3. skill tree is super lame and the game is ridiculously easy. I love this game. Play the majority on my Lenovo Legion Go and loved every second of it. I am surprised how well it plays with the controller is. I'm used to mousing keyboard, but this was fantastic in implementation. Story was good, but not great. It moved things along for some great hack and slash fun. So far, this is my favorite Diablo game of them all.. Okay-ish campaign, but the open-world implementation paired with the auto-scaling of the enemies' difficulty makes you completely lose the sense of progression. Instead, you feel like you spend the whole game in the same big-ass open map just running randomly to all directions doing chores. The endgame and balance are almost non-existent. The character customization and build diversity are also extremely lacking, as almost every build scales with the same stats and all builds using a skill usually are locked to the same aspects, so not really a good game for people who like deep build customization. The only thing that ""saves"" the game from being a complete bust is the combat, which actually feels pretty good, but that on its own can't carry the game enough to be worth playing, in my opinion.. If it looks like a duck, sounds like a ****'s probably a duck. Outside of the MSQ - this is a $19.99 game.. I don't play multiplayer, I rate the co-op campaign alone as a 10, a worthy successor to Diablo 2, a great story. I don't care about the rest. Finish campain uninstall like single player game.. Random network errors, all your dungeon progress is suddenly lost even if you play solo for the story. Then you have to do everything again until the next network error. Nothing but a cash grab with intrusive real money purchases. This us not a Diablo game you have long been waiting for. Abysmal.. The game is awesome, loads of top down, demon destroying action, plenty of room for customization, both in gameplay and appearance. I would quite happily give it a 9/10 except for this issue... The latest incarnation is horribly unstable, it freezes, crashes, and occasionally BSOD's, none of my other games do this, and D4 didn't do it until the latest version (With the Spiritborn class). Blizz NEED to sort this out or I (and I suspect many others) won't be paying good money for seasonal play.. Vessel of Hatred is actually fairly good fun but unfortunately its highly unstable. Lots and lots of complete PC crashes and crashes to desktop, Blizzard just don't care. All other games run perfectly. I even tried reinstalling Windows, still broken. I have refunded the game.. good campaign story, besides that nothing really special, yet again another cash grab from greedzard. Not bad games but the release of the dlc destroyed everything, games filled with bugs and a completely absurd new class, I give it a 0. T. Blizzard consistently destroys every game they make. Diablo 4 will be great, but its not.. I wrote a severely bad review when this game launched giving it a 1/10 because it was painful to play. This game is unbelievably fun now. What an incredible change of direction. Well done <3. I will start with a preface: I have been a Diablo player and fan all my life, generally speaking. I started with Diablo 1, it had amazing gameplay with second to none atmosphere of horror, danger, fear, and excitement. I even find myself going back to it every couple of years. D2 - was actually not a big fan, because of how the characters moved and how it looked, plus the atmosphere of dark dungeons was a bit lost with walking around in the open world. Diablo 3 was a mess, we all know that, but I still played it early, and I played it through seasons and spend thousands of hours in it. Now, Diablo 4... It had an amazing potential - the atmosphere was INSANELY good, the story - fantastic, the combat - just right, with monster slashing being very rewarding, you had to know what you were doing to get it right - just like the good'old days. It had some issues at the start, of course - mainly the itemization, and kinda lacking in the endgame - with the latter being easily accepted as we knew we would get seasons and they would work on this. So the only thing they needed to change was itemization IMHO. Unfortunately, Blizzard people didn't get that memo. They thought, that if people say ""Diablo 4 bad"", they need to change everything. So they destroyed all the balance (that still wasn't great, but it was more ""flat"" lets say), then they destroyed the gameplay, because they thought all the people wanted was same-same and more of D3. Thing is - D3 was not that fast in combat in the early stages, it went there throughout the years with the obvious power creep. With D4, they though let's just jump 5 years in the future and make it pew-pew-run'n'gun-dont mind ANY MECHANICS kinda game. Just brainless bloodbath that would only cater to the nowadays TikTok generation. And with that - all the atmosphere of horror, danger, fear and excitement went away. Oh, did I mention, that you get a legendary item every minute of play? How amazing is that? Sure... Unfortunately that's not me. I wished I got the game I've paid for at the start - the more engaging, more atmospheric, the one that makes me think of the combat mechanics, engage with it and feel the sense of accomplishment when I actually beat even a simple regular mob, not to mention side-boss, or the epic World Boss. Now everything is just loot piniata. I don't care about the itemization changes anymore, you might've fixed it, but you've ruined everything else Blizzard. That is why I will no longer support this game and I'm not planning on buying any expansions.. It just plays like a game where noone thought of having a good movement. It plays bad and story is just very, very bland. The only good thing about this game is cutscenes. But nothing else.. Do disappointed in this game. No value for money especially VS other ARPG's on the market. Bluring the lines between good and evil doesn't work in this world arc and is LAZY writing. No end game...UGLY CHARACTERS. Base game, and expansion, is an absolute travesty. Every aspect of the game reflects the core ethos of milking the player base for as much money as possible - classic Blizzard. Uninspired, unoriginal, uninventive. Plenty of other ARPGs to play that are better value and entertainment. Blizzard keeps getting away with churning out lackluster content because it has a legion of shameless sycophants who enable them.. Game was good before , after NEW DLC it worthless... if you wanna get full potential game ,push with your build forward in season , you have to unlock paywall by unlocking RUNES .. Requested for refund. Never come back here .. VoH has officially ruined the game in my opinion. They spent 5 seasons getting the game where the playerbase was mostly happy with it and then reverted it all back to season 1. Mobs are now bullet sponges. The progression is all out of wack and while lvling you can easily out lvl your gear. They reduced gear drop rates heavily, so if you lvl too fast without drops the mobs start to overpower you. And once you get through the leveling slog, you then have to grind the power creep, which has also been artificially extended. Aka you put in more work, but get much much less. And then a bunch of overly complex/grindy gear upgrades mechanics... And finally, the bugs. Sooooooo many bugs, disconnects, and crashes. And finally, the story is horribly mediocre. I wont give away spoilers, but it's tremendously underwhelming and disappointing. The game is just boring, tedious, and not fun right now. It's the worst state the game has been in both technically and gameplay wise. Do yourself a favor and hold off if you're on the fence. I'm also not a Diablo 4 hater. Ive played a lot of seasons and genuinely enjoyed the last season a ton. But they have totally reversed all the good they were doing. This seems a lot like catering to an elitist sect of the playerbase and making it to where casual players will see a good upgrade maybe once every other week. If you can't play 24/7 - good luck. You'll need all the rng favor you can get. To conclude - the game just isn't fun anymore.. Wow was falling asleep multiple times, i was not able to even play trough the second zone because its so god damn boring holy ****. Making 1 Billion off a disfunctional game, having the audacity to want another 40$ for a expac a year, hell nah.. Game is getting better each season. VoH will be a blast because the new progression + the new content.. It's terrible that the game is forced to be online. The servers are terrible, I have a very high lag (and only in this game) and I get disconnected frequently.. The game have so much lag that i can't even fight enemies. I can run baldur'sgate 3 without any issue but i cant' play your game ? make your servers playable or let us playwithout connecting to an online server. i don't want to play a wow lookalike. it's sad because it's the kind of game i love but it is currently unplayable. Blizzard, ****. Just how money-hungry are you trying to be? Season 6 is made for DLC owners, because without it, you lose 20% defense stats and even more offense (mercs boost your def and a big chunk of your offense, not to mention the broken runes, it's like having one more aspect and a skill bound together on one gear). Spiritborn is its own thing and that's okay, but you made it nearly impossible for non-DLC-owners to reach Torment IV. Season 6 is gonna be the final season for me. Can't wait to play PoE 2.. Diablo 4. Horrible. I gave it 1 instead of 0 because I wasn't allowed to post a review with 0. On another note: Seeing the disparity between the user score and the critic score is a great display of how useless critics have become. What is the purpose of a critic's review if it can't predict or align with the user score? How does their review help the consumers in any way? A game is deemed bad by users, but critics think it's amazing. Maybe they've based their opinions on aspects that aren't usually noticed by players? Well, in that case, they are basing their opinions on aspects that obviously have no value to the consumer. So if critic reviews has no value to the consumer, then who are they for?. Only thing this game has over the Diablo games before its is it looks nice complete sorry excuse for a game still a buggy mess all this time later Blizzard should be ashamed.. ...FFS is **** guys maybe are drunk are whatsever...I still play this game after 20 more years. And i like **** bombed...because you didnt like the graphics? The story? The music? Are you guys seroius?. Blizzard has annoyed their fanbase, assuring themselves less success in the future. Like any other Blizzard game, Diablo 4 is filled with too many glitches and bugs to enjoy. There is a consensus amongst the gaming community that nobody plays ""Blizz_ _ _ _"" games in 2024. Blizzard Entertainment has simply fallen off the map when it comes to producing any games of quality, or even that are worth your while to play at all. Blizzard games are not able to hold some of the top positions on Twitch streamer or Twitch watch metrics. They have annoyed their former fans and the gaming community so much that they have even resulted in playful name calling when describing just how bad Diablo 4 and other Blizzard Entertainment games really are. There are games that are of much better quality and there are games that are free.. Within 5 days of buying the game, I have already played 42 hours in it. I am very positively surprised by this production and I am really having a great time in it. It is worth noting that I am a beginner in ""Hack & Slash"" type games and I think that is why I rate this game so well. Seeing opinions and reviews, I can say that fans of the genre are not satisfied. I do not know the exact reason why this is because I have not been in the subject for too short a time. However, I know that Path of Exile is considered one of the best games of this type. From my point of view - an amateur - the game is enjoyable, the combat is satisfying and the whole gameplay is pleasing to the eye. After spending so many hours in it, it seems to me that Blizzard wanted to create a product that would be more accessible to players who had not dealt with such games before. The game does not scare with lines of text and many numbers and the system is quite understandable. Personally, for me it is good, however, I could only assess the sense of these things when I get to know POE closely. I definitely recommend the game to people who have never encountered H&S before.. In the first hour i was enjoying the game. The dark ambience, somber soundtrack and good gameplay had a glimpse of good old Diablo. Then the Diablo 3 way of gaming started to show up, repetitive enemies in a landslide, lots of useless side quests, zounds of bad items to pick up. I was only running to pass through enemies and finish the main quest to get over it.. For the most part it is enjoyable, altough maybe not as fun as I remember D1 or D2. I play it as a single player game and simply ignore the purchase and other not so important blablabla mechanics. What really kills the game are the random disconnects that kick you out of an almost finished dungeon. I have no words to describe this frustration... I wouldn't recommend to play this game unless it get's a proper offline option.... I think they have greatly improved the game since launch but still many issue. Very good visuals. Casual simple gameplay. adding more depth with more end game systems. Boring story. skills have limited customization unlike last epoch or PoE. Why does it require battlenet on gamepass?? Just continue to improve and the score will increase from me!. The campaign is very well done. While the game suffered from a lot of issues at launch, many of these issues have been addressed over the various patches/seasons. I look forward to Vessel of Hatred and the improvements coming in 2.0.. First of all I'm not a big Diablo fan, but I finished the game with my friend and with him the game was not bad. The graphics is nice, the design is great, the skill tree is cool. Yes I know in adventure mode it is too easy but we selected this one and it was super easy, the final boss was the easiest boss in the game. :) Maybe we will finish the game on harder difficult too.. Really impressed overall. The launch was not a complete mess like 3. Its fun enough that I actually go back every season and play awhile.. Really disappointed. I tried to like it but it just doesn't make it for me. I loved Diablo 1 and 2, but 3 was a step down and this is a total disaster.. I must say that the developers of this game hate players or are complete morons either way, good graphic & music though, what a shame..... Game is a complete disappointment for me. Campaign is too easy. No variety of boss fights and no challenge in existed boss fights except lilith. And imo evenlilith is bad designed.. Reading all these comments, I don't know if the majority of the audience is blind or just stupid AF. Diablo IV is a major failure; be it a story, be it the mechanics, be it anything you can possibly name! And this latest BS of Season 5 that rendered the game and progressing completely impossible, I can only say that Diablo is at a respirator and won't last much longer. Unless, by a miracle, idiots at Blizzard finally wake up and start improving the game. If that doesn't happen, then Diablo IV is truly dead this time, and it's all a waste of money, effort, and investment, on top of sacrificing the trust and hype of players just to earn some money short-term. A **** disgrace, when I have to say it that way.. Nonstop fun and the game is completely different than when it launched, just like Diablo 3 was. People give it such a low score because they hated the end game and online only component. Screw em. People who pee and moan constantly saying there's nothing to do or don't find anyone online to group with, you aren't even trying. My friends list is filled with people to group with, not to mention I have FIVE real life friends who play with me. Season 4 and 5 have been AMAZING. My friends list is constantly filled with everyone playing D4. That's how addicting and fun it is now. Vessel of Hatred will only improve on things. Literally no reason to hate the game. Stop being bad at it. Awesome graphics on PC, awesome music, awesome combat, fun as hell builds to play, awesome loot revamp, awesome everything revamp. Me and my friends will be playing this until D5.. The campaign is bizarrely easy to beat. It was no fun at all to play this. At least graphics and atmosphere were great, but that's no excuse for botching the campaign gameplay so bad.. I usually never write many reviews, however Diablo 4 is boring lackluster after you finish the campaign. I barely see anyone play online. I use to like playing it but after I defeated Lilith it is not so fun anymore. There is barely any grouping and Season 5 Hordes is terrible. Play this game only if you want constant grinds, boring endgame content, and lackluster of grouping.. Compared to similar games on the market Diablo leaves a lot to be desired. Additionally, it suffers from the stale, corporate, pandering story telling that most of these big AAA games made by large studios suffer from these days.. Diablo has been a long-standing franchise. so it's a little disappointing that this is where things stand. To be fair, the story is solid, as far as I can tell. And the graphic is what you'd expect from a developer of its calibre. But like everything else corporate greed comes into the picture and now it's a live service instead ****. Back in Diablo 2 you can go through the entire game single player. multiplayer was always optional. now that multiplayer is mandatory shakey connection suddenly have a grave impact on the quality of the game. When I was playing during the free trial I've noticed a few things, one being the quality of the graphics and soundtrack, the other being the shakey connection. I lose connection just about every single time I need to do map transition, i.e: enter and exit dungeon, waypoint teleport. And that drastically detracts from my overall experience which leads to this score. I'll sum it up real quick here. If you cant decide, then ask yourself two thing. Do I mind constant dc, is 30 or 70 dollars worth it? If money is loose, if constant dc isn't too big of an issue then go ahead. But for me I can think of better way or better games for 34 dollars (as of this writting) than to spend it on a game that drops connection this often so it's a hard pass for me.. Great graphics and gameplay, visually really captivating. I hate the idea of creating new characters every seaon. Cinematics was amazing. Good story.. Predatory game, shallow story, shallow character development, “live” model uses bait and switch to keep you playing while putting ZERO effort in game… toxic environment, toxic forums…. One of my favorite ARPGs. Great Isometric Hack-N-Slash Dungeon Crawler. Great for beginners to the genre.. Garbage story written by trust fund toddlers. Blizzard has given up on delivering solid games and insists on dropping the hottest turd they can in the hopes these greaseball critics love it. And they do, or else they don't get early review copies. Cookie cutter art school dropout story writing is enough to make the average player vomit on their screen the first time one of their hideous characters opens their mouth. Truly a disappointment so monumental it makes scam games look like they're worth the money. The only positive thing about the game is the graphics, which doesn't do much to help the score because any cro-magnon with access to modern software and enough time on their hands can squeeze out this kind of diarrhea. Pathetic. The fact they feel this game is even worthy of dlc is evidence enough that modern AAA developers don't even care about user reviews. And if they do respond to them, they call them bigots or whatever the new word of the month is.. Playing the campaign (as Barbarian) once was kinda nice. The other classes feel kinda clunky or maybe it's just me. The Postgame is a bad joke, even the heavily critized postgame of D3 was a lot more fun. I wish a had refunded the game when I still could. For 80€ I expected much more. I'm going to play D2 Resurrected when i feel like Diablo now.. I played at the highest level available from the beginning of the game in the campaign. I can't die in a fight, I would have to stand there and not move, then I would probably die, but the campaign is so broken that the game is embarrassingly simple, I stopped paying attention to the items I collect, I don't buy anything in stores, the rally is not necessary for anything, just go press x and all the enemies around explode, waste of time. One of the worst GAMES I've ever played.Very boring, same repetitive things over and over and over and over again and again,the story is boring and pointless and don't get me started with cash grabbing Battle passes and costumes, pre order and etc. When you look at User Ratings and Critic Ratings you'll see that Blizzard is paying these bootlicking groups to rate them 9 and 10.. The most recent season fixed a lot of Diablo IV's problems, but it still has a fair few. I'd have given it a 2/10in prior seasons. It may yet be a decent game if Blizzard stays the course and continues listening to player feedback.. It's average. Playing through the main campaign is fine - once. But - and this is a problem with this genre in particular - it gets repetitive really fast. The monster variety is poor and I am seriously burnt out on desert biomes to the point where I can't abide them anymore. The balancing is off, too. Difficulties 1-3 are too easy, in difficulty 4 many things oneshot you for no reason. Overall the game offers very little for its price tag ($70): the seasonal content is restricted unless you get your wallet out (after paying $70 for the base game!), and if you want the expansion (and one new class) be prepared to fork out another $40 for the standard edition (or $90 if you're insane and need the ultimate edition). I found the game world rather small for being an open world - Grim Dawn's world is larger and feels more ""alive"". The skill trees are disappointing after seeing the first drafts they have been significantly ""dumbed down"", not as bad as in Diab","the story is lacky, there is no content and depth. Blizzard should just give up and retire . it's a huge game with a well-thought endgame phase . it's just hard to stay in the grind for a long time ."
884.Vampire Survivors,"An awesome, simple roguelike with a killer power fantasy. While it can be slow to start, once you get some permanent upgrades and unlock some weapons, your character goes absolutely mad with power as you cut through hundreds of enemies at a time. Its pretty simple mechanically, but it has a surprising amount of depth to the maps and weapon combinations. Good fun that's easily worth its low price point.. The FDA should regulate this game, as it is so addictive, it **** you in and consumes you, not letting you go, for all the good reasons. This is fun in such a sheer state, it's toxic, but I'm still into ""one more session"" at every opportunity. I crammed this thing into every platform I owned for the last 2 years, bought every piece of DLC, and have absolutely no regrets at all, it's money way beyond well spent.. A thoroughly good game with lots of content and frequent updates. It's easy to get hooked and lose yourself in the copious amounts of X.P. gems.. A Form of Crack Cocaine that won't kill your brain-cells, will kill your time though! Genuinely addictive, call someone if you need help XD. This game is the best rougelite I have ever played, I played more than 170 hours and I have all the DLC which by the way I have more than 200 achievements and every second of the game was entertaining those 30 minutes of play went by very quickly , it is an addictive game I thank you those of poncle for this masterpiece. The easiest addiction of the modern gaming period. I'm here for that glorious Castlevania bundle.. This game is like cocaine. It is hard to explain, but it is the game I´ve played the most in the last 2 years, I believe. Simple, but fan and addictive.. A rare game which I truly would say executes perfectly on its goals. Arcadey fun that is downright addicting, while roguelite elements and killer couch co-op keep it interesting in the longhaul. The overall unserious tone contributes greatly to an experience anyone can jump straight into and have a ball. Great on any console, but especially great as a pack & play Switch game to share with friends.. This game is freaking cool! I think you guys should try it atleast one. This is a retro Touhou.. The closest thing to Digital crack available at a low low price. After sinking in around four days (according to my xbox) I picked it up again when it recently released on the Playstation store. Still an absolute joy and I'll aways recommend it to friends, even though not a single one of them has ever taken me up on it.. The worts indie in my life I ever player. This it's like those Altari's games that nobody cares. I think this is worts than E.T. never play this. this one is mostly hype, and there are many, many better games with essentially the same formula. yes, many of them were inspired by this game, but they actually took the time to make a cohesive product instead of just throwing a bunch of features at the wall and seeing what sticks. there are lots of balance issues here, some weapons or characters are just poorly thought out or the same as a handful of others. there are a lot of half baked features like the map guides being so difficult to read + disappearing when you are close to them instead of getting brighter, inability to read information about our abilities after we have selected them, the complete lack of a minimap, and just the fact that the creator seems to only add more maps and units/weapons via branding deals instead of addressing long standing and overlooked UI issues. to me it feels like they just stopped trying once it sold enough copies, and it just leaves every part of the game besides the first few hours a boring mess. i'm still playing it out of boredom, but it just seems like sunk cost fallacy more than anything. get the abilities that deal damage in aoe around you, and just stand still? we are literally punished for moving via damage and many abilities simply do not function if we are running around. i could deal with all of this if the ui made more sense, especially in terms of showing us which areas have an objective left or some kind of guidance on how to find out what the objective is. it seems like im unlocking levels at completely random rates and ive found late game levels before unlocking level 4, but i have level 5???? its just messy, i know it's made by a very limited crew, but the game truly does not motivate us to keep playing and is decidedly more of a timewaster than anything else. ( Overall )The game for 2 euros seems offered, the game developer is very committed and has released updates regularly, the game currently turns out to be quite repeated and too small to maintain ""interest"". Survival by waves gameplay is quite interesting, there could be more challagens during these waves and a lot of fun but being an indie game, we have to **** I recommend the game?I bought the game because I found it interesting and I was looking for a game to kill time, the result I'm not disappointed but I'm not surprised either, I believe that the style of the game can satisfy some and not **** you are interested in this type of game, give it a try.. It's kind of fun, but it's extremely repetitive and grindy. Other newer Survivors games have a larger variety of characters where the character selection actually matters. In Vampire Survivors, character selection barely matters. You can use the same strategies on most maps with very little change.. It really, really flies by. Combination It's fun to work hard. But can get bored easily.. Mindless fun. Not very much to comment on except for the fact that I cannot recommend any other game (as much as I can this one) for a quick sit-down.. A really simple idea that turns addictive real quick. This game introduced sub-genres like roguelikes and bullet hell to a new generation and did a damn good job while doing it. creator of genre . no need to tell more another explain to sucess this game. I read a lot about this game online. How amazing and addictive it is. So I got it, played it on Steam Deck. I really tried to like this game, but after about one and a half hours of trying, I can't see why others love this game so much. As I see it, I spawn in, pick up a few items, hope to the digital gods that the automated attacks hit even one of the monsters (that's right, you can't actually attack anything, the game does that for you - and often times fails, unfortunately) and then die. That on repeat. If that's the type of game you enjoy, go for it. Maybe I just haven't sunken enough time into it. But I definitely wouldn't buy it a second time.. Vampire Survivors offers some of the best bang for your buck ever. For its low purchase price, the game offers plenty - it is a sublime combination of relaxing and frenetic, letting you feel all kinds of dopamine-fuelled excitement while you simply control the game with a single stick and the occasional button confirmation. While its gameplay loop wears thin after several hours, Vampire Survivors, with its ease of access and rewarding gameplay, will provide just about anyone a ton of fun. In terms of what it strives to be and what it offers players for its price point, this game achieves its goals with aplomb, and is absolutely worth what you pay for it.. This game is one of the best i ever-played one of the craziest addictive game ever. playing this game for like 7 hour a day during my exams ( i am going to fail) the amount upgrade,weapons and character you can found or unlock is crazy. I can't believe how much this game provide at such a low price going to 100% this game for sure. One of the best indie games. Absolutely can recommend. Considering it started from a single developer and costed only 1$ when I bought it, it has grown so much as of posting this review.. Vampire Survivors is a roguelike shoot 'em up game released in 2022. Game mechanics are simple, we are directing the character on the map. The character we control is a killing machine and spreads death to field, using the weapons and power-ups that we have. Weapons fire **** are collecting the loot from the enemies we kill, we are trying to level up and we are also searching artifacts on the map in the meantime. As we level up, we get new weapons and new power-ups. As we get stronger and gameplay extends, we encounter stronger enemies. When our adventure on a map ends, we move on to new maps. You can enjoy this adventure again and again with many different characters, special powers and evovled weapons and game modes. In short, this game is addictive.Developer team still supports the game with new updates and this is an another factor that increases the value of the game.. A game that builds upon itself in such a smart way like a true rogue-like. Feeling like a god after you have the perfect build for the first time is a great moment. After the 30th time doing it and realized 10-15 minutes into a run that you won't be able to die, does make it lose some of that luster, but it wasn't until 30-40 hours in did it feel like that.. Vampire Survivors offers an exciting gaming experience with its immersive dynamics, addictive gameplay, and profound strategic elements, making it a perfect choice for fans of vampire-themed rogue-like **** game's entertaining and fast-paced action makes each gaming experience unique. The ability to customize your character with different vampire powers, items, and enhancements encourages strategic thinking and allows you to develop a character that suits your playstyle.With its graphic style and atmospheric design, Vampire Survivors draws players into a captivating world. Furthermore, the game's continuously updated content and active developer support provide players with the opportunity to constantly discover and experience new **** those interested in vampire-themed rogue-like games, Vampire Survivors is undoubtedly an experience not to be missed. Its addictive gameplay and the promise of a different adventure each time set it apart.. Didn't like the scaling at first, or the way some weapons are better than others. But after playing it more and beating some levels I get it. I see it when I close my eyes. Amazing brain hack, but with a fair economic model, really cool.. Fun game similar to a mobile ****'sa good time waster, and good for achievement hunting. It's simple and fun.. the perfect stim game. Surprisingly, this game can be very fun and addictive even with terrible graphics! :) I spent almost the whole holiday playing this on the ASUS Rog Ally, which is not built for this kind of performance! :). My favorite roguelike so far. So much to unlock, so many interesting builds and stages. Really good!. It is very very VERYVERY VERY VERY addictive, and time gets erased. I didn’t even notice that I was playing this for 10+ hours straight.. good, simple fun. nice to listen to a podcast (Trash Taste) when playing. and its SUPER cheap.. I was a bit unfair on my first review. It's a good game. Fun and addictive but the fun wears thin quickly and I need to take a break. It's good for what it is though and if you just want a quick half hour session, it fits the bill.. After achieving everything the game has to offer (by the time 196/196), i finally think i can give a review. Its great! Its exactly what you want for a action-roguelike! If other games annoy you, just play a few hours of vampire survivors, have some success and leave again. Its great!. Pretty looking 2D game which is so suprisingly amusing and satisfying. I love this game. The graphics are simple but effective. The concept of building up abilities over time not just per round but unlocked via a currency is a smart idea. The unlocks in level amount to new items and characters. As a result the replay-ability is very high. How items are unlocked during rounds and how the player chooses to level up and claim treasure can be integral to how successful the player may be that round. The amount of content for the price is extremely good value. Buy this game and play it lots. It's great and at times it's mayhem in the best way.. Dont buy drugs, buy this.. Very fun casual game its amazing playing a game in 2023 and no microtransactions.. Extremely fun and addictive roguelike that can scratch an itch few other games can. It can get very repetitive, but for the price even an hour of gameplay is enough to justify a purchase.. this is a cookie clicker that cheats you to think its a real game. It's so stupid and has no right to be as fun as it is but dammit it IS fun. It is an auto-firing reverse-bullet-hell with lots (LOTS) of hidden secrets and unlocks, easter eggs, pop culture and game references, and numbers. Yes...LOTS OF NUMBERS. Your screen will be FILLED with numbers as you grow more powerful and spend 5 minutes simply standing in place obliterating every monster, their friends, their families, their past and future children, possibly even their future reincarnated selves. Every character has the potential to achieve GOD LIKE power and it IS A SPECTACLE OF PIXELS. It's also incredibly addicting. However, I've struggled to find motivation in completing the final secret bits of the game, as it does get repetitive eventually. There were also a few bugs that led to some significant confusion as to why certain unlock conditions weren't triggering their rewards, and I did run into a few instances where the ""secret"" is hidden in a way the old NES game secrets were hidden - so obscurely you will most certainly need a guide for at least a few of them. Overall, a mindless, fun game that doesn't break the bank.. played.. Quintessential rogue-like! Forgoes complex graphics in order to focus on gameplay systems that work flawlessly, are super fun, and have tons of replayability.. This game is crazy simple but fun. The Castlevania knockoff graphics might look dated, but adds to its charm.. Very simple game, but can be very addicting because of the variety of builds and characters. Highly recommend it if you are a fan of the genre.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Do not play if you enjoy sleeping. The only thing holding this game back however is the late game Steam Deck performance. VS is advertised as Verified, but I'd argue it's borderline unplayable once you get to the 20 minute mark in your run. There are so many assets on screen that before you know it you'll be holding a handheld microwave and slapping skeletons at 2fps. Due to the already extremely simple graphics and chaotic nature of the game, I doubt that the performance is ever going to see a change. On PC though it's of course a different story, and probably the best gaming value for money in recent memory.. Absolute quality little game! If you need to sink 20-40 minutes before you gotta do something, this is a nice, easy and fun way of doing so. Very satisfying to the lizard brain. They guy making it keeps updating it with new bits and it's not cancered with in-game transactions and battle passes and whatever other capitalist man-made horrors beyond our comprehension that we must normally endure these days.. A simple game definitely worth its price, you can spend hundreds of hours in it and still have fun. Took nothing but existing mechanics, combined them in an exact way not seen before, and created an entire genre out of it, all while being ridiculously simple, but incredibly engrossing. It's the addiction of mobile games, without the harmful monetization and lack of depth. The pricing of the game and the DLCs is also severely below what they're worth. This is one of the most humble showings in gaming.. This game is like gambling but without the part where you sell your house and end up homeless. The core gameplay is simple but very addicting, and is filled with much more content then you would think 5 dollars could get you.. It's an addictive game with a simple formula, lots of things to try and tons of different items.. Vampire Survivors is a highly addictive and entertaining bullet hell game that is perfect for gamers who are seeking a fresh challenge. The game's mechanics are straightforward and easily comprehensible, dropping players straight into the action. The maps and monsters are well-balanced, and the various power-ups ensure players remain engaged, providing a genuinely challenging gaming experience. This game is the embodiment of excess with its monstrous creatures and maps that are sure to delight gamers who enjoy this type of aesthetic. Every upgrade and weapon unlock feels like a significant accomplishment, adding to the sense of satisfaction as you progress through the game. The game's simplicity and addictiveness are what make it stand out, making it an ideal option for those who want a game that is easy to start playing but difficult to stop. In summary, Vampire Survivors is an outstanding game for players seeking a unique and captivating bullet hell experience.. They were calling this game one of the best of '22 and I never got a chance to try it. The title was a bit, it seemed simple. But when I went to my friend's house and he told me that it was a very fun game and that I should try it, I did. And I experienced that it really is as fun and as addictive as they say it is. So what makes this game so fun? What is the genre of this game? Believe me, I don't know anything, all I know is that I should play it. Vampire Survivors is actually a very simple game. It's a game where you just walk and make choices. There are basically two mechanics. The game asks you to solve these mechanics for a long time. As you discover new weapons, passive items, you try new things. Either you're always making progress or you're discovering things. The reward cycle is awesome. Just when you think you've completed the game, it suddenly gets deeper. Even though the game seems very simple, it actually includes a story mode where you can make progress. And they spent a lot more time on this story mode than I thought they would. I expected a lot less from a game that is played with two buttons for distraction. Moreover, the game has done a great job of setting up the infinite loop (the ability to play and get something out of the game even after it's over) that games like this tend to try to do. There are so many systems in the game that I can't mention in order to avoid spoilers. The game also doesn't ask too much from you. Yes, it can take a long time, it can be addictive, but it requires enough brain activity that you can play even while watching a TV series, I think you can have a lot of fun playing this game on public transportation instead of those hyper-casual games that are copies of each other. Even if you don't make progress in the game, you can buy another weapon, you can try something new, you can play in a place you've never played before. And it's not that cryptic because it shows what you can do from the game menu. This game wanted to be a very simple game. It managed to get a little bit deeper in the gameplay without breaking its simplicity, without tiring you out, and it probably surprised people other than me. I definitely think it's a game that can keep you entertained for even longer than it promises. You can put it between heavy games and rest your head for a while. But if there's one thing this game does very well, it's to keep you playing. Of course there will be those who don't like it, but it's definitely a great game that I think everyone should give a chance, that exceeded my expectations a lot and that I think is one of the best games on mobile as of the time I'm writing this.. Hours of Endless Fun Initially when watching videos of Vampire Survivors, I didn't really understand what the appeal was. For me it wasn't a game I enjoyed watching other people play and I think because of this, I wasn't wholly interested. Although I did buy it when it was still in Early Access for a later date, but also simply due to the fact 50% of my friends list was playing it. After being convinced by a friend, I finally gave it a try and I fell in love with it. The game is rather simple in terms of game play, pick a character, pick up items, evolve the items with other items and survive as long as you can. There are many stages, bonus stages and a large abundance of weapons and characters, so much so that there thousands of combinations you can go for. Plus with the Randomazzo cards, it just adds more elements to the game. For me the fun part was just trying to survive the 30 minutes and unlocking new characters. As quite the completionist, getting all the characters and weapons was just so entertaining to accomplish. I felt as if I couldn't stop playing the game until I'd 140/140'd the achievements. I do however have one gripe with the game and it might not be totally valid but I'd like to share anyway. Eventually, in most Vampire Survivors runs, especially when you know what you're doing, you just hit what I would call ""Critical Mass"" where you are effectively an untouchable god. To unlock certain characters and items you need to survive for 30 minutes for certain things. However once you know how to play the game and how to build, it's possible to reach ""Critical Mass"" in as short as twelve to fifteen minutes. Which at that point, you're literally just standing there, waiting for the clock to tick down. When you need to do this multiple times, it can feel a bit boring. Apart from that, the game is great. I like to go by the rule of £1 or $1 an hour, depending on your region, I paid about £4 for this and have nearly 40 hours in it. Truly unbelievable amounts of fun and an incredible game that everyone should at least try once, especially at this insane price point. 9/10 I look forward to new updates and losing my life to it again soon.. Best cup of coffee priced game I've ever played. It's so addictive and rewarding so you have to see & play it yourself, it's one of these ""just one more round"" games. Learning curve is also good, more you learn about the heroes, weapons, passives etc. more interesting it gets. And you can play it on handheld or even on phone (for free!). Highly recommend it.. Incredibly cheap game for the content within. I've unlocked everything in the base game as well as the DLC's, and it's been a ride. A ride in which I played it every single day until it was completed. I even got all the achievements I loved it so much. I'm not really into 2D games, let alone ones with this type of graphic style, but the design of the game is superb. Either this solo dev (when it was first developed) really understood what the general gaming populace would like, or they simply struck gold making a game they wanted to play and found fun. A seemingly simple, instant-satisfaction game. The game becomes more complex the more you play, as there's more upgrades to unlock, little secrets you'll want to find, more characters with different stats, etc. The fact this game has been kept at the $4.99 price tag shows that the developer actually cares about making it as accessible as possible, and this is absolutely further proved by their future action of placing it on mobile for FREE. Of course, this game does not have 1000 hours of content, and once everything's done, it becomes rather boring. However, there's MANY $60-$70 games right now, that were developed with some of the best talents in game design, and they pale in comparison to this game on replayability or content!. What a simple but addictive game! Good maps, good weapons and abilities, cool combinations. Little bit short as of now still.. I'm salivating from my mouth. New games always crash. They are very slow and boring. If you like vampires and retro vibes, it's hard not to have fun.. Great game, has a very addictive combat loop. Lots of items and wide variety of enemies to fight. Garlic is so satisfying to use every run as well. The base game could do with more levels.. One of the most addictive games I've ever played and probably the best game I've played last year considering, it's not perfect, but I'll dare you to find a better price to entertainment experience. Avoid this crap even for the low price! Constant screen freeze that make lost all progress. Game wont let me reach 100k kills and freeze all the time before reaching it. Incompetent devs, **** game. The cheap is always too expansive.. Vampire Survivors is incredible, but don't trust me: try it. Really. From the outside, it is a raw and old-fashioned rogue-lite with some fun Italian pranks. From the inside, it is an addictive and entertaining experience which wonderfully adapts to your play style. The incredible and always expanding possibilities of weapon/upgrade combos, together with the exploration of the secrets of the levels and the roster of characters, make enough room for experimentation and desire for exploration. TRY IT, WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS. A surprisingly addictive bullet hell game where you are the source of bullets. It is really enjoyable to try out different strategies and to get more and more content as you progress in the game.. Vampire Survivors is an action roguelike that challenges players to survive against waves of enemies for thirty minutes. The only action the player can perform is to move around the screen with the player character firing any collected weapons automatically. Collecting orbs from defeated enemies allows the player to unlock new weapons or upgrade the ones you already have. With it’s basic graphics and relatively straightforward gameplay, this is a game that may seem a little light at first, but the variety of weapon combinations and desire to survive that little big longer each time makes for an extremely addictive title.. I grab garlic I run right, I get dopamine. The fact this game is so cheap is insane, the dev deserves more.. A game to play while watching a movie or doing something else. Graphically, don't expect anything. Weapon and character variety is good enough.. It's addictive. It also makes me feel really bad about myself, and cynical about the human race in general. It's tedious, boring, repetitive, and definitely more frustrating than rewarding. I just keep thinking ""Is this it? What is this all for? When does something -interesting- happen?"". And maybe, after walking through the empty map for half an hour, something interesting really might happen, and then the game spawns another 10.000 enemies and you realize that you are wasting your precious life. This is like a prototype **** that might be really really good. But this just ain't it. Props to the developer for creating this game with such limited resources and making a buttload of money, but looking at it for what it is... There's not much there that would justify these high scores at all. It's like huffing aerosols. Those who do it would give it a 10/10 too.. it's a very simple and additicting game, a mix of survival, roguelite and pixel art ARPG, also it has an incredible company, Poncle precisely, behind the scenes who seems to be concerned about quality and has so far created a DLC that is very reasonably priced and is available to offer many free updates in the future. Tip: Don't waste your time reading more reviews, just play it.. Ok, but nothing special. If u like Rogue LITE unlocking weapons/upgrades it could be fun. For me its too boring nonsense. I dont even see anything original. I recommend Gunfire Reborn if u dont like Rogue Like/Lite genre same as me.. This game sounds and looks very boring and dumb. But it is a heck of a lot of fun and very addicting. The simplest of games but... just so fun!. This game is absolutely fantastic. A few bucks for a game + its DLC and I know for a fact that I will, over time, put hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this game. The value-for-money exchange here is ridiculous. It's been a decade+ since I last played a game where it truly gave me that ""Just one more round!"" feeling where you say that at 10pm and realize you're still playing at 3am. This is that game for me right now. The gameplay loop is quick, exciting, fun, and most importantly; not predatory in the slightest. You pay for a game and you get that + more. It's not a game I will play consistently or daily. Maybe over time it won't even be played weekly. But it's a game that, when I do play it, I will play it for hours and have a blast. That's really all you can ask for as a gamer. Especially when you're looking for a game that doesn't REQUIRE you to play for hours daily to make progress. This is just a gamey-ass game. No strings attached, no **** It's really good, simple-yet-surprisingly-deep fun.. Very additive game! simple and fun. overall its good. But its a little over hyped according to other forums.. Spent half a hour trying to get this to ""start"". My conclusion was 20+years of experience of getting buggy pc games to start is not enough. Cant remember last time was not able to get a game to start its just a matter of effort this game took the cake in a bad way. Bad code should pull a games grade down significantly if it cant be played, its unlikely im the only person who was out of luck getting it to start.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. Its instantly fun, easy to jump and as deep as you want it to be if you devote the time.. It’s so addictive and so good. Worth playing. Don’t look at screenshots or videos, don’t check reviews. Just try it, if you have tens of hours of time to play it. Because it would be barely possible to stop. Vampire Survivors is a very addictive and fun game. Weapon combines are endless. You can play it with one hand. You don't even need to use brain or concentration:) After hardworking day you can simply play and relax while listening music, podcasts, tv, videos.... Very addictive, fun but with bad balance, no endgame content after 20 minutes. Absolutely amazing game. I’ve almost finished every unlock but I have seen the “end” of the game. This has to be the most bang for your buck game of this year and maybe the last decade. I’ve put over 30 hours into this game and I don’t regret a single second. For those of you writing off this game as low quality because of the graphics, you’re actually insane, touch grass, get off of CoD for five seconds and listen to the damn soundtrack. Beautiful pixel art, satisfying gameplay loop, and the soundtrack is all bangers. There’s even some surprises to find that are really rewarding experiences. 10/10 the vampire is in another coffin?. HOW CAN I STOP? A game that I've played without stopping for hours, and I can't find a way to stop.. Great game, fun for everyone that is not bothered by flashing lights. Has much more depth than it might seem at first. Main issue for me is that the maps get too repetitive rather quickly and the 30 min cap is rather long if you manage to have a god tier build. At that point there should be some option to speed up the clock to 30 by throwing the hordes of enemies immediately on you. Either way, recommend it for everyone! I hope more maps and weapons get added, as currently the game encourages specific builds. After you finish a run you see your stats which highlights which weapons do the most damage. This in turn makes you automatically disregard the ones that have obviously the lowest numbers.. Absolutely shocking how such a simple game can drive my horrible little rat brain crazy with dopamine.. Fantastic game. So simple yet addictive. Progression feels to always be occurring, plenty of secrets and little unlocks a long the way. Before you know you'll have been playing it all week. Nice and cheap too.. Odd, ugly, simple... But highly addictive and pretty well done. Does nothing new, but does nothing bad, everything it is well implemented, and the amount of satisfaction when you see the screen full of things you don't even know what's going on... That's amazing. I want off the ride. Every time I try to stop playing I decide to throw on an","this is an awesome, simple roguelike with a killer power fantasy . the game is so addictive, it ****s you in and consumes you, not letting you go . it's easy to get hooked and lose yourself in the copious amounts of X.P. gems ."
885.Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes,"Probably the best DS game along with Final Fantasy Tactics A2. This is turn-base Strategy at his finest, there is no other game like Clash of Heroes. After all these years I'm still hoping for a sequel.. Awesome puzzle game !! great RPG elements. Great tactics and puzzle and in the nice fantasy universe of Might & Magic. I wish they would make a follow up. This game has aged well and will keep you coming back for more. Resolution does not suffer on the 3DS. I cannot wait for the next installment. Awesome work, Ubisoft.. Don't let the match-3 appearance fool you. It's actually a unique and imaginative strategy/puzzle game, and it's executed very well. It might not have much to do with Heroes of Might and Magic, but it's worth a chance to appreciate it for what it is.","this is turn-base strategy at his finest, there is no other game like Clash of Heroes . it's actually a unique and imaginative strategy/puzzle game, and it's executed very well ."
886.Total War: WARHAMMER,"It's getting better. The devs are doing all the right things. I like this game alot, I hope you do too!. Spend a lot of hours with it. It was a fantastic choice to bring the chaotic world of Warhammer to the total war series. A success for sure!. Simplified tactical considerations regards others TW games and an expensive DLC politic... The game is far to be perfect. But is an absolutely huge game, with a lot of factions of warhammer series (some of them paid ones) and full of different units with all the essence of warhammer, the graphics are beautiful in tactical and strategical views and the settlements management is complex and deep... All factions has also different game mechanics and the replayaibility is infinite.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 7.. Really good strategy ;) I have played 2 fractions and dwarfs are boring but vampires pretty good.. Who tf came up with the idea of not being able to occupy 70% of the settlements in the game. 6+/10. Bad map, bad unit design, laggy, bad transpassing from old version of total wars.. Very meh game. Many total war features were simplified for casuals that are new to the genre and overall the game is much easier. The only good thing it has is the fantasy setting but there isn't much replayability once you have tried each one of the races.. Brilliant game, it rekindled my intrest in strategy games. Great graphics, sound and music, every race plays completely diffrent, I`m now well over 100 hours played and I`ve done empire, chaos ,beastmen campaigns and now I`m doing dwarves, each one is fresh and diffrent and there is still a lot of campaigns to do.. My one negative is the lack of a story. They could have turned the whole chaos thing into a grand epic but instead of get a ""Baby's First Book"". That aside, the gameplay is rather quite enjoyable. Date Completed: 2021-03-01 Playtime: 77h (Failed around turn 90, 2nd time completed the long campaign) Enjoyment: 9/10 Recommendation: I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.. Enjoy your fantasy battles with the different factions. do not miss this addictive game. Warhammer makes total war definitely more interesting. But heroes abilities and agents, as well as buildings could have been better developed. Overall it seems as total war has barely evolved over the years.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. one of the better total war games, like empire rome 1 good fx you need all free addons to install first for best experience!. Not a bad game. Good game. + * versatility; * decent story; * upgrades and so on; * good performance; * diplomacy. - * as usual you need a huge army; * your heroes (not lords, aka agents) ****. Even if you push them to tasks all the time and promote they will ****. Save-load as it was in Rome TW; * as agents ****, enemy agents succeed; * as usual enemy army SUDDENLY comes to the only unprotected corner of the map. Lame; * need at least to save automatically every 3 turns. I almost finished the game and all researches. But I was too bored to fight with the sudden green skins and just deleted the game.. Another poor effort from CA they really are living off the back of Rome total war now. This game offers no challenge it's just easy. I won the long campaine without ever being the strongest faction or ever having to fight the strongest faction which just seems dumb. Some of the factions will have no involvement in your game what so ever. The graphics are stunning but that shouldn't be what a total war game is about. the battles are awesome with magic but the campaign is simplistic and it feels more a casual total war game but again battles are great and variety of units also great. Takes hdd about 4min to load campaign & manual fights. AI is challenging even on easy mode, Greenskins can rake in a lot by sacking & raiding kinda like in Attila. You take the best strategy series in the world and put it in the Warhammer fantasy setting. Its not so tactical as usual but hell more fun when you see your Grimgor Inronhide smashing those nasty dwarfs. Orc Boiz FTW!. It is not as good as other TW games. It isn't quite a WH game. It is fun for a while, but if I want to play TW, I play Shogun or Medieval TW. If I want WH, I play Dawn of War. So I have struggled to find this satisfies me on either count. Still, it is fun.. TW:W is a very fun game that allows you to live out your dreams of massive fantasy battles. I personally play custom battles, but from what I have played, the campaign is also quite a lot of fun!. Gameplay is fun, different, and engaging. Visuals are nice to look at. All that Warhammer charm is there. While there is a ton of replayability to start with there is a lot of dlc that doesn't make sense.. Very boring game. I can't wait until they get back to the historical titles, this fantasy crap ****. Think I will just stick to Rome 2 for the time being, much more enjoyable.. I was not a very big fan of Total War and knew nothing about Warhammer, but when a fantasy TW game is out, I simply could not ignore. I have played some historical TW games before. I enjoyed them quite a bit, but manual battle managing was not my favourite part of those titles (I used to auto-resolve most battles). Surprisingly, TW Warhammer has changed the way I play TW. It makes me want to control troops by myself and now I rarely auto-resolve. I also spent more time with this game as each race has its own unique units and play-style. However, building, trades and politics do not lived up to the level of the historical ones. In addition, I wish that CA would give options for people to adjust complexity/difficulty of battle, diplomacy and economy. To sum up, I strongly recommended this game for those who enjoy fantasy and planing, but maybe get it on a discount as it has quite many dlcs.. For a big total war fan who has played every game since the beginning this game doesn't grab me. I have no knowledge of Warhammer and because of that I find it difficult to be immersed, The game is very well optimised and one of the best so far in terms of the mechanics. Although there are some positives I find the campaign map featureless and boring to play. But with considering all that I would probably give it a 6 or 7 out of 10, but with this ridiculous DLC policy where you have to pay around $80 dollars for all the current DLC it has to have a negative review.. One of the best Games i played the last 10 years. Together with Witcher 3 and X-com. All Factions are Unique and all got Unique Units. Not like the previous TW games with all those Copy&Paste Units and Factions. So far it was worth every cent i did spend on it. I played around 1000 Hours now and already preordered the next part of the Triology. CA/Sega will have a hard time with the next Historical title because if they go back to copy&Paste factions, people will hate it. They tasted the High standard now and most people cant go back. If you want to have hundreds of Hours good entertainment with a High replayability in a Fantasy strategy Game: This is your Game. Its will be the first complete Warhammer Game ever made. And im sure such a mammuth Project will not come again so soon. Thanks CA/Sega to be so brave and made such a High Risk niche Project of High quality.. I bought this game for 60€ at the release,with only 4 fractions in this game, serious bugs, a lack of variety in units and, well, missing important fractions. The world itself and the graphics looked really good, so did the new hero and general system, which added a nice rpg part. The game itself got best, when all of its DLC´s had been released and all updates had been made, since the game lacked content. But overall, after buying all DLC´s to get the real Warhammer feeling, i already spent more than 100€, which is actually too much. The fact that CA already implemented new factions in the campaign despite you havent bought the certain DLC, made me pretty angry (18€ for one single faction, seriously, this is too much). While being within the battle, the KI **** even more than in the previous total war games. The only thing that made the KI tougher on higher difficulty were cheats on the campaign map, but sadly not in the battle. Even legendary difficulty was a joke... .So i won battles were i was underpowered 1 to 5 easily thanks to crappy KI. This brought me to installing mods, but still i can´t judge this game with content created by other people than CA. But sadly even on the campaign map, when you wanted allies to attack something, sometimes it tooks at least 10 turns for them to actually show up, neither did i recieve help when i had a city under siege. And i shouldnt even start talking about establishing trading relationships... So after the last DLC was released and everything has been updated, the game was enjoyable, but still hasn´t used it´s full potential.. This game has exceeded my expectations on release. It runs very smoothly and I haven't encountered any bugs within 40 hours of gameplay. I didn't pre-order and I got the Chaos DLC for free on the first week. This is a great example of companies listening to their fan-base as I wanted to see how the game turned out before purchasing. Good AI, Unpredictable AI, New hero system, Air unit. I have been playing Total War games for years. Rome, Rome II, Medieval, Medieval II. I was looking forward to this one. What an unplayable game! Even on the easy setting, this game is extremely difficult. Prepare to be annihilated. The AI gives your enemies all the best units and a lot of them while you struggle to build basic units with your minimal economy. It's amazing how enemy settlements with two buildings can field hordes of elite units. Terrible game balance, destroyed by 20 turns or less, and that's the easy setting. I give it one point for nice graphics.. Don't believe 86 score here! It's 80 at the best! But if be honest it's 75 and not more. After SEGA bought CA they have been only spamming low quality games - Empire, Napoleon, Rome 2, Attila.... (Medieval 2 started making as Activision title). The best times of CA (as well as Relic's best times) had passed long ago before SAGA bought 'em. You can take a look the first and best DoW was made under THQ patronage, the first and best CoH under THQ patronage. The first and best TW were made under Activision patronage. SEGA are just **** and sponsors of **** making practice in video gaming.. I´ve played a lot GW Warhammer (and 40k) in the 80s and 90s - and well: Total war Warhammer is (after many tries of GW) the best digital transcription. It is just Total War in the Warhammer Univers - and you can´t stop play ... one more turn ... and another! Just Great! ... and can´t wait to get a hand on TWW2!. I really love the series total war. My acquaintance began with Rome 1. The series developed all these years and reached its peak at Atilla. But, in my opinion, the warhammer, a serious step backward.. Total War: Warhammer has been one expected marriage between two franchises which we all wanted to happen. But, the final product deserved a very better finishing. The game itself it's correct. A simple copy-paste based on previous Total War games (Rome 2 and Attila). The map maintains the system started back on Rome 2, and basements are build in that way. It is far the time of Medieval 2 or Shogun 2 where the building of a base was some kind more open, with a lot of chances to be done. The graphics should be better. Yes, the battles are quite awesome, but nothing that we haven't seen on RTW2 or Attila. The map looks nice, and it's close to what the world of Warhammer is. By the way, one very negative aspect is that Total War franchises had become pure DLC games. If you want to experience the game fully, you need to spend a very big quantity of $ on the DLC content. Yes, it adds new races, with their own units, but this is something old Total War games used to bring on the base game. DLC contents should be intended for expansions like Napoleon Total War or the Kingdoms expansion from Medieval 2.. This is an average game, its basically rock paper scissors with Warhammer units. Id rather they came out with a tabletop Warhammer game based on the tabletop rules. Seems rather repetitive. I did have more fun with Rome and Napoleon. Something about the game makes it easy to put away and forget when your done with it. Certainly, there is the one more battle syndrome which can occur. I just think at this point it isn't such a fresh format, and seems like a Rome TW mod than a unique game.. I played Total War games from Empire onwards and I will say to me personally their peak was Shogun Total War 2. This however is a nice feeling game and has provided more of a challenge to me compared to other TW games I have played. However I did not enjoy the random bugs that would appear such as when my 5 of units at full health suddenly rout to 1 unit that has less morale and is near destruction for no reason other than AI being dumb. It has caused me to go from winning a battle with 80% certainty to suddenly a heroic defeat. This has more or less killed a few campaigns I have played seeing as once I encounter that bug I immediately step away from my PC and not boot this back up again. Other than the occasional bug I appreciate what CA tried to do here and if they would release a TW WH40k version I would give it a shot since the promise was there and hopefully the execution is better.. This game crash 17/20 times I tried to play it. 3 times when it work, it work good. Have wasted 17 hours (track hours on Steam) trying to get game to work. But is not good work. When work is good but not playable.. F*cking amazing. Love TW and love WH universe. Did not think this game would come out so good. Lots of hate for them and their DLC policy which I agree is pretty wack but the game itself is so much fun. Grabbed it off Humble monthly for only 12$. There is so much variety in the races and styles of play this will definitely be on of the longest times I've spent playing a TW game. May even take the top spot of Shogun 2. Just get it on sale, same with DLC and you will have NO regrets.. very good strategy game it is my personal favorite of 2016 don't listen to the 0-5 scores they don't know **** of strategy games or maby even just games in general. It has a lot of units and factions with still a lot of dlc's incoming with even more units. Great strategy elements were you actually have to think off . if you love warhammer or strategy game you just need to have this game. Since Empire, Creative Assembly have been slowly developing the engine used in modern Total War titles to simulate combat in a way that it both satisfying to look at and strategically engaging. With Total War: Warhammer, the engine's teething issues feel as though they have finally been resolved. The combat works in a similar way to how it did in Rome, albeit with more satisfying cavalry charges and better animations. It feels a bit strange to be applauding a game for feeling like a game from 2004, but the teething problems have taken a long time to resolve. However, despite the actual simulation of melee combat taking a huge step in the right direction, I cannot in good faith recommend Total War: Warhammer to any veteran of the series, for a number of reasons. The campaign has taken a step back from all previous titles. The map feels small, and the joy of expanding out, conquering varied factions and culturally assimilating them into your new borders just doesn't exist here. For a start, you can only conquer regions that belong to your faction's designated nemesis: This will mean that you will either be ruining an extant civilisation or reclaiming what was yours anyway. This design philosophy also seriously restricts the replay value of the campaign. Previous Total War games allowed you to go into a campaign and adapt to whatever scenario you decide. Even in Attila as Western Rome (which on the surface feels very set in stone), you have a huge range of possibilities: You can attempt to hold onto your thinly spread territories with military might; you can cede territories to the raging hordes whilst redesigning your inefficient and corrupt empire into a wealthy, centralised Italian kingdom with the intent to reconquer once you're in good stead; you can disregard your poor holdings in the north, betray your Eastern Roman brothers and create a powerful Mediterranean empire, or you could just attempt to create a huge range of vassals and client states with your struggling empire at the helm. With Warhammer, none of these options are afforded to the player. As the Empire, you will always start in-fighting with your elector neighbours (and face hundreds of strategically uninteresting battles where you just fight the same units you field). As your empire begins to take shape, you will turn your attentions to the Vampire Counts (who need to be destroyed as a win condition), before ultimately consolidating your empire, allying with the Dwarves and defeating Chaos. The first time you do this, it feels amazing, but every successive playthrough is exactly the same. There will never be a need to fight the Greenskins or Dwarves as the Empire as their settlements cannot be captured. Another issue is that each faction has very specific mechanics to consider: whilst this sounds good on paper, it makes playing them far less interesting. The mechanics of offices, family trees, religious conversion, trade and diplomacy have been split up and assigned out to different factions. The battles also lack many of the more in-depth tactical elements that previous Total War games had. You can no longer pick from a range of arrow types (unless you're Wood Elves), you don't have access to special formations (such as wedge and spear wall), and your options for unit spacing and preset formations are severely limited. Every faction only has two formation types: archers first and melee first. This doesn't work very well given that two of the playable factions don't even have access to archers, so your only options are to deploy in a straight line. It also makes all units feel very basic, put there to fulfil a single role like the units in Command & Conquer games. Your spears are for monstrous units, your swords are anti-infantry, your guns are anti-armour etc. It seriously limits your strategic options and forces you to just hope you've taken the right army for the job instead of working with what resources you have. Graphically, the game has significantly less fine-detail than previous titles. Guns and artillery pieces no longer have reloading animations, model variance is much smaller than even Medieval II, and all cavalry have the same coloured mounts. This makes playing as chaotic forces such as the Greenskins very jarring, as they look far too ordered. This review feels like it is being negative, but I will close by saying that Creative Assembly have succeded in creating a game that captures the Warhammer universe: I just believe that the sacrifices made to pull off this vision have created a game that feels much less detailed, vibrant or interesting that any previous title.. It's **** garbage. I know CA is pumping up the Metascore with **** nonsense like most developers who aren't even worth their salt. Warscape is garbage.. The game with all of its DLC's and features is fun, even if many of the usual Total War systems are dumbed down to the simplest level. That being said, the cost for such dumb fun is around 150$ Canadian. Outrageously not worth it, not even close. Also it should be noted that against the wishes of an adamant fanbase CA was chopping the game up for DLC's long before it was out. The ""Chaos day one DLC"" was just shameful, but even basic options like blood and gore are a DLC in this. Next Total War we'll probably have to pay for sound effects. So the base game itself, covered in insulting little dlc moneybags and locked content is about 70$ Canadian. This is why Creative Assembly earned a 2.. Graphics are so poor that it totally ruins gameplay for me. Looks like the game is 15 years old. Even if this game was released in the year 2000, I wouldn't be impressed with it. Rome ii, Atilla & Shogun 2 are graphically much better. I have the game on my gaming laptop + saw it on a friend's desktop on ultra settings. Had to lower scores as more dlc came to divide players even more. Crappiest total war game, even shogun1 was more complex. This was clearly made to sell loads of dlc. There's nothing wrong with having dlc but it's priced almost the same as the figures and they sell you unit or couple at a time like the figures. Because of all the complaining and bad sales they give you free dlc character if you go to games workshop store, flight to nearest one (500miles) costs the same as the game with all dlc.. If anyone recalls the previous Warhammer 40K games, they had DLC as well. Winter Assault came out and you got one new playable faction. Then another DLC installment came out and you got to play as Dark Eldar and one more faction. I just don't see the problem with it. The DLC adds to the replay value of the games and makes them more fun. And they are all less than $15. BTW. Not a millennial. 40 years old. Wife, kids and mortgage. Quite yer **** cheap asses!! This game is super fun and highly addictive. To the dude who logged in 150 hours of gameplay to give this game a 2. Are you friggin' kidding me? How could anyone play a game that long if you hate it? That's putting in 5 hours a day for a month! Unless you're getting some serious coin reviewing games, you need a lady friend bro.. The game is good it works great and the game play is smooth everything is how it should be. However the worthless DLC is a point against the game. Locking off factions and troop types. Keeping out the major races like the Elves and Bretonia seems like another penny pinching scam in that regard but by no means a bad game.. One of the best, if not the best Total War so far, before anyone stop and say about shogun 2 and napoleon, please please play it first, and feel how nice and smoothly the units move, the cavalry got a great movement from previous games and in the strategic aspect the game got new mechanics introducing magic and flying units, also got the best from both, TW and Warhammer fantasy. a must have if you are an old timer in the series, love warhammer or TW or simply a strategy game fan. am not surprised most of the comments are **** the players were mostly married and with a mortgage they would scream **** the millennials are mostly buying this scam....they have no houses to **** wives....most live at home with their **** clueless about capitalism and politics.......someday...they will have to leave the nest......single or **** then maybe they will wonder ....is it right to buy a war-hammer strategy game at full price with only 5/24 factions????? and not even a total war **** cannons to breach (from afar ).....no built **** copy paste settlements without a difference........dumb and dumber AI with each installment..........paying for blood...........paying for **** a supposedly total war game........WHAT IS YOUR IQ????. So much wasted potential. I’m playing on hard. I’m not talking about the DLC policy. I’m not talking about few 5 playable races. I’m not talking about the choice of releasing Beastmen as first (or second) payable DLC, which is extremely stupid since they are simply a mix between Orcs and Chaos, which are both already playable… What will be next? Norska? Please provide us something DIFFERENT next time if you see what I mean… Skavens? Elves? THANK YOU. Anyway… The game, on paper, is great. Warhammer and Total war is (was?) the beloved dream of many geeks of my generation. The fact of having a scenarized game with the final Chaos Incursion is pretty cool. It provides consistency in a game where there is a rich lore. The regional occupancy Mod allows getting of regional occupation limitations (it would have been cleverer from CA to provide it official) It really is an immersive game. It’s a long time I haven’t been that much immerged in a game. Playing the Orcs and expanding from the Badlands to the snowy Northen Karaks of Dwarves was a cool experience on my first playthrough. Playing the Empire and expanding to the North and East to face as a protagonist the first Chaos Invasions was super cool. You can expect to have extremely Epic battles, 3vs3 to Death battles ringing the end of mankind! The graphics are great. The Lore is (except some “meh” things here and there) is superbly rendered. The epicness is really there. But… Then comes the late game (the first 100 turns are great, then it’s over…) In fact there is a core problem with this game. There is something wrong. There are actually 2 things that ruin the game. The first thing wrong is the way the Chaos Invasion is handled. Mixing Chaos and Northern Tribes invasion is pretty cool but Skaelings are the pain of my existence. Those Norsemen have literally free spawns. Irrelevantly from their holdings they can insta-spawn full army stacks and endlessly attack you over and over and over and over. I order to get rid of them, don’t expect to mobilize less than 2-3 full stack armies (representing probably 100% of your force…) in order to destroy them. In other words: IMPOSSIBLE to do when at the same time you need to deal with Chaos Invasions and spreading corruption causing your regions to revolt and full advanced troop Rebel stacks needing at least a full army stack of yours… This really is a problem: Skaelings are too powerful and it literally ruins the experience. Second problem: stupid A.I. When you mean Stupid A.I. you mean cheating A.I. When you mean cheating A.I. you mean: complete immersion destruction. I don’t care the A.I. being able to summon 2-3x more troops than I do. I care about having to constantly play “Chaos Whack-A-Mole” and “Skaeling Whack-A-Mole” because cheating A.I. goes faster than you do despite all your buffs and exactly exactly where you’ll land and knows how to avoid fight. I care about suffering all attritions and A.I. not suffering them. I care being overwhelmed by swarms of Agents corrupting my regions having like 90% chance of killing my agents while I have, on paper, 30% chance if killing them but in reality it more looks like being 1% chance of killing them. No… NO C.A. If you can’t make A.I. clever enough don’t make it cheat in any other way than spawning TROOPS FOR BATTLE! So now, mix problem 1 with problem 2: result is pretty simple: expect having s**tloads of small roaming armies running through your lands down to the least defended city (since A.I. doesn’t have fog of war he knows where to go), razing it and making your full stacks busy chasing them on a F***ING CONSTANT BASIS since Skaelings will stalk you all the F***ING TIME… Jesus… What a horrible choice from C.A…. You want to make Chaos Invasion difficult: Make Skaelings a SMALL faction and make Chaos bigger. In my playthrough it’s easier for me to defeat chaos than Skaelings… It makes no sense… That literally ruins the immersion. On the top of that. Add other regressions: - River battles are not present anymore - Sieges are AWFUL. Either one or two side walls. No Squared cities. Thank you. Strategy please? - Fixed Story: Since the “story” is here and Chaos steps in very quickly, what will happen will always be the same. Don’t expect to play more than 2 or 3 times and experience every time a different playthrough. Source of lack of replayability. - Lack of playable factions. Second source of lack of replayability - Beastmen DLC: mix of orcs and chaos: doesn’t add much replayability I would like to much this game to be good. But for the moment it’s a hate and love feeling I have toward it. And so few would be needed; - Nerf Skaeling and make chaos stronger - Stop making cheating A.I. (no attrition, different RNG results, A.I. being always quicker than you despite all your movement buffs). If A.I. is not clever enough, simply make it spawn more troops. It’s a much better decision. - Take out Marching Stance: it destroys everything in this game.. After putting in more than 150 hours in this game I feel like I am ready to give a valid review of this game. I have never had any experience with any Warhamme games before, so I was mesmorized when I entered my first battle, but that was soon to fade. It is not that battles are bad or poorly made, they are just all the same, and it becomes very tedious in the long run. The enemy very rarely engages you, they just stand there and wait for you to engage. And sieges are all exactly alike, which after 100 hours of gameplay makes you auto resolve more or less every battle there is. Diplomacy is a joke - an utter joke. Vey little effort were put into this by the devs. You can play the game without ever really engaging in diplomacy, but just pressing ""ok"" and move on. It is not really that important for succes of your progress, sure it will make things a bit easier, but not much. What really makes my blood boil, is ""Join War"" option. If you you allies, or ask them to participate in a war against a certain faction, they never show up or help you defeating the enemy faction. The ""Join war"" option is random at best, and more or less useless. The overall feel of this game becomes ""lather-rinse-repeat"". But, the one thing I loathe, the thing I absolutely hate and makes me scream at this effing game and ragequit is the ""Heroes"", and their lack of succes. Now, math has never been my strong side, as go the same for the devs. How so? Let me explain. If a hero has, for instance, 59% chance of succeding in a certain action, how come it takes up to 15 attempts for that action to succed?! If succesrate is 50% or more, it should according to my calculation take a maximum of 2 attempts, for an action to be succesful. Nothing is more frustrating than watching a single enemy hero massacre an entire army, while you can do nothing to prevent this. There is no point in having heroes, except bolstering your army with perks. Despite all of this, my real beef with this game is the DLC´s. This game has become a symbol of GIG (Gaming Industry Greed). The game itself is 60 euros, and at the current moment the total price of DLC´s are 34 euros, so total price of game pushing almost a total of 100 euros. This is insane. All the DLC should already be in the game at the price of 60 euros. Now, the DLC´s look good and fun, but if I buy this, I would support GIG hence signalling that in the future they can pick apart games and sell them off at ridiculous and unaffordable prices. I simply cannot and will not support this action So, my advice is do not buy this game in its current state. Put it on your wishlist, and buy it on sale in about a year or so. Thank you for your time. the game is oversimplified, and for 60 bucks was completely undone. many previous features of Total War franchise are missing, campaign strategies and battle tactics are childish at least, I repeat the game is undone. and the worst thing: more than being a stupid game and no more a strategy game, SEGA and Games Workshop are working together to sell any DLC possible, including the silliest one I've ever heard about: a payable DLC for blood and gore during battles...that's amazing a payable DLC for pure aesthetics...that's madness. I will never ever spend money again on SEGA, Total War nor Games Workshop products. Their policy is just to get as much money as they can from kids. Mature players bye bye. 87 EUR ? Seriously ? :-D 59 EUR for the game. Let's add an other 18 EUR for the Beastman race (should AND could have been included day one). 7.5 EUR for some extra Warriors. Icing on the cake : 2.5 EUR to add some gore. A good game (7/10), but certainly not worth 87 EUR, whether you are a Total War / Warhammer fanboy ","i like this game alot, I hope you do too!. Spend a lot of hours with it . it was a fantastic choice to bring the chaotic world of warhammer to the total war series ."
887.F1 2020,"It took a console generation, but with Playstation 4 and Xbox One on their last leg, Codemaster does pretty much everything right with F1 2020. Last year's excellent version has been expanded with a greatly improved career mode where, in addition to driving, we also get to control our own team in detail. Outside of the that addition however, much is the same as F1 2019. If you do not care about a career mode or updated drivers and teams, you will be fine with last year's version. For F1 fans, however, F1 2020 is in many ways a perfect racing experience.. The most satisfactory F1 videogame in the Codemasters series, both from a driving experience and management perspective.. The greatest of all time F1 game by far .The historic cars add a nice prestige about the game. Way better than modern day F1 games.. One of the best F1 games ever. Codemasters have really outdone themselves. AI is tough and realistic, handling is as smooth as it can get and it gives a real feel of racing.. Codemasters' F1 series continue to put in the mileage, upping the competitiveness, expanding the F2 series and adding the My Team mode for what is the most comprehensive package to date.. With a driving model more accessible than ever, F1 2020 will let you enjoy its brand new My Team mode even if you are a newcomer.. With the new team-mode and intelligent detail tweaks Codemasters can lift their Formula 1 experience to a new level once again. Overall an absolute powerhouse of a racing game that is only held back by its microtransactions.. Codemasters’ F1 series is continuing to improve and stake its claim as the best racing game for simulation veterans and newcomers.. F1 2020 is a good racing game. The racing action is intense and the game options are endless. It is also cool that you can start your own team in career mode. Still, the game suffers from two flaws: the gameplay is almost identical to F1 2019 and the loading times disrupt the fun.. The last great F1 game that Codemasters made. Very stable, lots of features added for the first time.. This game is great. I""m using it on PS4 pro. Only thing i can""t forgive here is the content. Codies just removed some Classic F1 cars, and they just replaced it with some others. There is a lack of DLC content, they should add more classic tracks in to the game like they did in F1 2013. They improved some things from 2019 season, but still very similar game. So if you don""t own 2019 season than this game is must have for all F1 fans. If there is more classic content my score will be 10/10. 678/5000 Ok game is good. It would be nice if this game was out today. But this game has a history and foundation. F1 2020 is just an update in my opinion. everything is a little thicker and wearing makeup. It's easier to race. Vehicle controls are easier. There are big problems online. They didn't think much about the design of the game. Everything is simple except for a few major design changes. I mean, I perceive this as an insult to players who have played for years. It's a great game for new players. but just update and insult for players who played previous episodes. I'm sorry but we're not stupid. We see what you want to do. If 1 year is not enough to release a new game, do not release it.. Same old, same **** innovation, no imagination, no **** ""my team"" is very limited and is filled with macrotransactions. Buy at a sale or discount if you really need to, avoid at all cost if you have F1 2019",Codemasters’ F1 series is continuing to improve and stake its claim as the best racing game for simulation veterans and newcomers . the gameplay is intense and the game options are endless . the loading times disrupt the fun .
888.Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak,"Monster Hunter games are my weakness and after putting in 800 hours into this game I can tell you it’s amazing and the wire bug feels great to use. I’m an LBG main and they did right by me on this. While the overall structure is similar to the base game, the story adjustments and optimizations in Sunbreak bring back some of the charm reminiscent of World.. I'm going to prefice this by saying that I've not played a Monster Hunter game before and that this was my first (and also last) experience with the series. I have heard a lot about the series and how amazing it is so I decided to check out this latest installment of it and see it for myself. Unfortunately I came out of the experience utterly dissapointed. To start off, the tutorial takes the approach of explaining everything to you with walls of text instead of being intuitive and showing you what to do during gameplay. This results in a piss poor tutorial experience where it essentially doesn't teach you almost anything substantial and the player doesn't retain almost any of the information. I do not know whether the tutorial mentioned it, but I do not remember it even including information on how to lock on to monsters, which I had to look up on google to figure out how it works. The other tutorials are even less clear and again use the wall of text method, so I almost fell asleep during the very start, which is already a bad sign. When I got my first quest I had no idea what I was doing, the tutorial did not even explain healing though I was able to figure that out on my own. I had no idea, however of any of the gameplay mechanics. I kept dying over and over again, and had no idea which buttons do what outside of heavy and light attacks. I knew there were some kinds of skills but had no idea how they really worked and was mostly using them blindly. The most jarring part of the game are the controls, they are extremely clunky. I do not understand whose idea it was to put the attack buttons as Y And B instead of X and Y. I'm sure there is a way to change this in the settings, however the fact that this is the default setting is just ridiculous. This resulted in me constantly seathing my weapon as I'm used to pressing X to attack. The other issue is locking. This has to be the most counter intuitive target lock I've ever seen. You use L1 to lock onto the target. However this doesn't actually lock on, it only points your camera at the target at that time. You have to keep pressing it in order to keep looking at and attacking the target. What's worse is that if you hold down that button instead of pressing it, it opens up this radial menu, which is extremely annoying and another stupid design choice. The mechanic of the Monster running away from you halfway accross the map is just extremely annoying and completely kills the pacing of the combat. Esspecially when your mount just decides to **** off somewhere to neverland to fight some random monster you're not even focusing on or fighting. The only positive thing I can say is that the game works and that it runs well, which unfortunately in today's day and age is something to be praised. However that doesn't really matter as much unless you want to go through the painful expeirence of this game. Overall my first experience with this game and series has been overwhelmingly negative, and I think that whoever designed this game needs to seriously reconsider their ideas of how game should be designed. I really cannot recommend anyone to play this, as it is just a frustrating and unintuitive experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I'm not sure how much content the DLC has compared to the base game, I bought them both together. But every Monster Hunter DLC has a high price than they should have. With a discount, I think it's a good idea to buy the DLC and keep playing this great game.. Monster Hunter Rise is a fantastic entry in the series, offering a perfect blend of classic Monster Hunter gameplay with exciting new features.. Had it not relied too much on randomness, Sunbreak would have been one of the best expansions in recent years.. I liked the base Rise on PC, but it felt too short and lacked any kind of end-game content. Sunbreak added a lot of stuff that you can put dozens of more hours into, including an investigation system, follower quests where you team up with NPCs, and a brand-new gear augmentation system that requires farming. There's also new monsters, and an all new rank - and the difficulty gets pretty close to perfect! Altogether, super enjoyable! If I game basic Rise a 7/10, then Sunbreak elevated it to a 9/10 just for coop fun! Story line, characters and such, i won't even include in the rating because I do not care.. Visual: 9/10 Its monster hunter, but back to its roots and bright and colorful. Audio: 9/10 monsters sound great, hits sound satisfying Gameplay:9/10 This may be divisive but I don't really care. Wirebug is an great, takes the place of hunter arts from MHGU but adds very fun mobility. Recommend?: Yes, if you are a fan of the series you are bound to like this entry. The game feels a bit on the easier side due to the ample amount of I-frames on wirebug arts, but the new monsters have excellent movesets and are engaging to fight.. this is a really cool expansion for Monster Hunter, they added so much to the game, the new monsters are all great,. My only critique is the pacing. I wish the new content was spread out more, but that's a nitpick really. Great stuff besides that. I've heard some people have save file bugs on PC buy I never got that and it runs great on my end (1440p 90fps). Rise was my least favorite Monster Hunter and Sunbreak addressed a lot of the issues I had with it. Rampages are gone now. There's a good endgame loop (if you like RNG, which I do). The story is better! The combat provides more of a challenge. You are able to experiment with more of your moveset due to switch skill swapping. The movesets got more varied with various new moves, which also buffed and debuffed weapons that needed it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I've played 150hrs for G rank and I love every single part of it except frequent force quit on PC, this is the best action game. Old hunters always complain older titles are better, it's like a ritual for monster hunter community which is pretty sad. Hope Capcom will make next title more beautiful and action-packed!. it's monster hunter DLC , its all about monster hunting, to me this DLC is the true Masterpiece!. There's literally nothing bad about this expansion. It's just perfect from start to finish.. the weapons are fun to use, the monsters are funny to fight, the 2 new maps are splendid, there is a lasting endgame, it is optimized well on pc it is fun with friends, what more could you want?. The story is much more interesting when compared to the rise base game. The NPCs are actually helpful this time as compared to the Iceborne which is literally just forcing and watching you kill monsters. New skills are interesting and allows players to hv more options and playstyle.. Insanely disappointing there’s no cross-progression/cross-save with MHR on Switch. Such a huge missed opportunity. Good- New monsters and subspecies along with foes from previous entries are challenging and fun to fight. Existing monsters get new moves that keep encounters fresh. Switch Skill Swap and new Skills are fun to use. Follower Quests make for a fun side-activity while Anomaly Quests finally provide a decent endgame. Quality of life changes and new features like Hopping Skewers and Buddy Recon are excellent additions to the current formula. Bad- Pacing is a bit slow at the beginning and it takes time for the new monsters to appear. New environments are pretty but don't mix up the gameplay loop or add anything game changing. No new rampage content or any integration of existing content into the current game. Endgame is still lackluster compared to Iceborne. Thoughts- If I had to sum up my 30 plus hours or so with Sunbreak, it’s that this is more Monster Hunter Rise content for those who like Monster Hunter Rise. If you’re a big fan of World who couldn’t get into Rise and wonder if Sunbreak will help, then it may not necessarily be for you. However, if you enjoyed Rise, grinding out everything from the Rampage to Crimson Glow Valstrax, then, well, you already own Sunbreak and everything is pretty much moot. It doesn’t go out of its way to reinvent the wheel and takes some time to truly open up. Nevertheless, the new skills and gear, tons of new quests, challenging endgame and new monsters are more than enough to keep you engaged for a good long while.. Not sure where the troll reviews are coming from but its not MH fans. The additions they made to an already fun game are just awesome! They really listened to the community and learned a lot from older additions they tried to make in the past that didn't quite pan out (like clutch claw from world/born). The new endemic life,hunting helpers, monsters, FRONTIER monster, maps,melding,MR armor and weapons, Palico & Palamute abilities, followers, and hub are all great additions. If you are into a monster hunter game where you are kind of a super human then this game is for you. I am so pleased with the devs for listening to feedback, giving us monsters we really wanted, and making a good effort to offer different varieties of difficulty. I LOVE Sunbreak even as a 2nd fleeter.. Not sure why some people are being sassy divas about this dlc. It’s amazing. Also, for those who are more casual players, it’s a fantastic way to get higher level gear quickly so you can take out some of the late game elder dragons. Adds a lot and plans to add more along the way. Great addition to an already great entry to the series. Well worth the asking price imo. The Citadel theme is a certified banger. Unbelievably epic, what a game. A joy from start to finish.. I don't give out 10s often but Sunbreak definitely deserves it. They have taken the base game and made it bigger and better in every way, whilst also adding a ton of much welcome QoL tweaks. A big complaint in base Rise was the lack of end-game but that has been remedied with hard, rewarding hunts post credits. They have also upped their game in the fashion department with some truly incredible sets to unlock for you and your buddies. My only gripe is you still can't layer/transmog your non Rampage weapons, so I hope this is added at some point. Simply put, if you enjoyed Rise you will love Sunbreak, it's better in every way you can imagine, and then some.. Horrible G-Rank release. Somebody in production thought Monster Hunter was a story-centric game when NO ONE plays it for the story. Do not buy, its not worth even 10 bucks. Its not worth your time. 4 colored variants that feel the exact same as their original ones. No new weak points to change up the players strategies. The main base feels like it was supposed to have lot of other areas in it that are now just 'roped off' (literally roped off). The new monsters look like they belong in a knock-off MH clone. This is easily the WORST MH release to date. Every other G-Rank release had content in it. They just said have the same monsters do more damage and have more HP in the same maps, rehash the armor models from 'World', slap in 3 new monsters, and release the game. So if you want to play the same game as Rise all over again with nothing new, by all means go spend another 40 bucks.. Perfectly worthy MH. It is complement to the MHR, and the degree of difficulty is suitable.","i'm an LBG main and they did right by me on this . i've not played a Monster Hunter game before and this was my first (and also last) experience with the series . the most jarring part of the game are the controls, they are extremely clunky ."
889.Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom,"I played this on Series X and it won't let me review for that, I'm sure it will be just as good on Switch though. So I only played a little bit and have very little bad to say. The controls could have just been refined a tad but the sound, the graphics, the overall vibe, it just nails what it's trying to do. It's fun to play and I'm not a huge fan of platformers, or Metroidvanias. As far as platformers go, I don't think it controls quite as nice as Gianna Sisters and it's not as good as Tinykin, and for a bright, quirky Metroidvania, I would probably go Rabi-Ribi before this and The Knight Witch, honestly blows this out of the water. but it's still great fun. For me a game is about the sum of its parts rather than the parts themselves, it just has to grab my attention and make me want to carry on playing and this does that. As I said though, the individual elements are great too in this case. It feels polished. Basically it's a whack enemies with a sword game, in platformer format. If you are playing to mash up baddies then there is no way I would recommend this before the likes of Ys Origin, or Legend of Nayuta but if you particularly like 2D platforming, then it's a great choice. 8/10 from me, maybe I'm being a bit generous at that but if you're keen on platforming games then this could easy be a 9/10 for you. As I mention, there are a good few games that outshine this in similar genres, so not a 10 but still a very solid game and worth a buy.. Pretty much a miserable experience from start to finish. Cheap enemy design and placement. Many enemies fly through walls and floors making them invulnerable. Others constantly rain projectiles on you. Found myself using nothing but cheese strategies because it’s a miserable time otherwise. Your main attack is one of the most pathetic hit boxes I’ve ever seen. Magic is next to useless. Monster forms are poorly balanced, you’ll spend most time in lion and dragon forms and only switch to the others when necessary. Music is pretty bad and sounds like grade school band class. Couple decent tracks, but locked to areas or boss fights. Most of the puzzles are nothing but try-hard time trials. Shame because there is potential. Balancing seems either rushed, or only tuned for a hardcore audience that demands digital misery. Seriously don’t get it. Why does every game need to be a try-hard ****? And banking on cheap tactics is not helping this title at all. Monster forms needed more polish and the amount of equipment is completely unnecessary. In fact a lot of the equipment bonuses should be power ups for the monster forms, so they’re all viable and balanced through the game. Metroidvania elements need work too because a lot of paths were blocked by story related keys, rather than power up. Boss fights are probably the best part of the game. They usually utilize the monster forms best.. This was a great 2D scrolling platform game. A lot of back and forth sometimes, but in general, a good game. Game play is super smooth and the different creatures/powers/armours are pretty cool. Reminds me of old style adventure games but with better graphics and music. Definitely worth playing.. This game starts easy like a really nice sword plataformer, a huge tribute to Wonder Boy series. Then in some parts the difficulty steps up and the game turns into a Mario-like quick-jumping game. You have to absolutely master the special skills of each character and change very quickly between them. That was not what Wonder boy III and IV where like. In the end I found it a bit frustrating.. This is a game that starts out deceptively easy, then quickly ramps up to ""Nintendo Hard"" levels of frustration. I bought it thinking it'd be a nice, casual romp. Instead, it became an absolutely frustrating slog. It's not the kind of game you play and win. It's the kind of game you just get through, so you can say you did it and put it away, never to touch it again, so your obsessive-compulsive disorder won't constantly be thinking about it as something left undone in your life. I finally beat the game, but I should have given up on it and walked away so many times. I wish I did. But, my obsessiveness kept me going, wasting my time and making me regret playing the game. The problem with the game is it's trying to do too much with not enough need. There's multiple sets of armor & weapons, but you only ""need"" a few parts of them (like double-jump boots) or the set ability of one to make an area easier (the ice armor helps in volcano zone). They spread your abilities across many different characters/monsters, equipment, spells, etc, then throw every puzzle imaginable at you and hope you can remember which ability or thing you have that you hardly use and have forgotten about might work in this one situation. If that's not enough, they then throw in the need for perfectly timed jumps, monster character transformations, etc, to get through area, all while fighting the awkward controls. YES, I said the controls are awkward. Other folks are saying the controls are responsive. I found myself fighting with them almost every step of the way. The controls are just awkward enough that they add frustration to the split-second platforming you have to do in some areas. Then they try to use the games wonky physics in some puzzles, and you're getting frustrated. Because it's not you who's bad, it's the game that's bad and the game devs using a poor game mechanic to add unnecessary difficulty to a puzzle. It all feels like the game devs went ""it's not a bug, it's a FEATURE if we can bake our shoddy controls and physics into obtuse puzzles to add extra unnecessary difficulty!"" I read one person's review where they play Dead Cells, and don't have a problem. Same here. I've played it and beat it through the various enemies and endings. The controls are spot-on, the physics ""just work"". But, in Monster Boy, the controls are off a bit and the physics are, too, but the game devs decided to make many puzzles require perfect control work and physics. So, with controls and physics not good, the puzzles become extra hard. You're punished for the developers being poor at their job, and trying to capitalize on it by thinking that ADDS to the experience. That doesn't even go into how obtuse some of the puzzles can be. I had to crack out a FAQ to figure out what to do or where to go every 30 minutes. There's the ""Nintendo Hard"" areas, then there's just the ""how was I supposed to know to do that or go there?"" areas. A good game provides enough hint to figure things out. This game does not. Meanwhile they throw in treasure hunts to find gems to upgrade your gear. But, a lot of gear does the same and you feel like an idiot upgrading it just to realize you really didn't need it. The ending area of the game is an absolute pain designed to be sadistically frustrating. But, it's the exclamation mark that just underlines how frustrating the game has been up to that point. Some folks love this ""Souls-like / Nintendo Hard"" stuff, and I don't mind it if I feel it's fair and I'm just bad and need to ""git gud"". EG: Dead Cells. I ""got gud"". But, this game prides itself on being punishing, and prides itself on handicapping you then acting like YOU'RE the problem. There are moments of fun in the game, but then they are rudely interrupted by bumping into yet another frustrating area, or getting lost and not knowing where to go. Overall, I just can't recommend this. I slogged through it, and regret that I didn't just give up and walk away. I could have done something better with my time.. I got this game because I wanted to play a long lasting metroidvania, but didn't had a lot of expectations for the game, besides its great old school inspired graphics. Monster Boy was a delight ****, with lots of places to explore and lots of different transformations that add a lot of depth to the game. I got stuck at several places, but enjoyed the challenge. Only complaint I have with the game is that changing from animal to animal is not as well developed in the Switch game as in PC, but overall, a great game to play.. One of the best platforming-metroidivania games in recent years. Gameplay is very fun and anime style art is beautiful. Soundtrack is excellent, especially the opening song (English version). Fun story, big map with many things to explore, well-designed bosses, and interesting puzzles keep you enjoying this game from the beginning to the end.. Inconsistent tone and theme problems. Graphics are good, but art syle is terrible. Music is grating. Gameplay is weirdly sluggish, changing gear requires a pause and delay as the game reloads your character. Difficulty is a mess, either being easy or strangely difficult. First boss is terribly designed, being awfully punishing at random. Could have been improved by introducing his mechanics throughout the level instead of all at once in the boss fight. Your drunk uncle isn't a good villain.. I absolutely loved this game right up until I got stuck in the Crystal Caves where I cannot complete the required actions before the timer moves the platform back. It's unrealistic to expect everyone to be able to do that in the time allowed and now I have to just write off the remainder of the game. A long time Wonder Boy series fan since mid 90s! But first the TL;DR parts. Pros: Lovely art direction, Great music especially from Yuzo Koshiro and Banjo Ollie, Great looking game for gamer furries, Choc full of details n gamer content, pretty good animation. Cons: Buggy hit-detection, Too many harsh difficulty spikes, no easy or adaptive difficulty for casuals/kids/pros, constant chalenge is welcomed but does go too far with em. 8/10 TLDR is over I'm pretty mixed with this game but I lean more into the positive. I do love this game but there are times where the creators should've dialed it down a bit to give gamers a rest n more easier time to explore rather than have them constantly switch it up too much when it comes to gameplay styles and sudden challenge rooms the player has to do. The artwork, animation, alternate art styles for some hidden areas are super well done, in 2D wise this is one of the best looking furry games I've seen. The game does need an easy mode for children or people with low tolerance with being cheap shot with brutal challenges where most of them are mandatory to beat the game, if these hard challenges were reserved mostly for optional side quests then that's fine. Having an easy option in the game menus would be a great mercy for low tolerant gamers also tho this game is marketed to retro gamers n furries, it's also marketed to kids where accessibility in that field of gaming is way more taken seriously. Reason I bring up the flaws of the constant too much bloated hard trial and error difficulty is because this is a big issue, especially when you've done one task you're now forced to do something you're not prepared for in gameplay wise and will fail alot and sadly you cannot skip these. I do commend the creators for putting so much time and effort into the entire game front to back... but there is a saying that ""less is more"" and there are times where I felt like the game wasn't letting me breathe n just do some exploring without having challenges constantly thrown in my face. And at times I have gotten frustrated and had to take a break. This game is also considered to be the hardest in the Wonder boy series, wonder boy is no stranger to having some easy entries having very hard sections or just being hard in general but this one takes the no.1 spot for being hard and sadly most of the time it's for the wrong reasons. I can only see really determined gamers like myself actually beat the game or in my case ""Complete"" it where I assume about 2% of people have done that... and... that's not a good thing for this type of game in the modern era. I do have very good tolerance for gamer **** but I have mentioned this game does have buggy hit detection where you've clearly dodged or blocked something but you still hit and end up dying/failing a challenge area. Sadly this is one of the few games i actually got angry at because of failures that aren't my fault because the game's constant gameplay tone shifts it doesn't condition the player to adapt to in time. The reason why so many great very hard games are so well favoured because through visual n gameplay (without text in some games) they explain and prepare the player for what they can come across tho they are no stranger to pull off some cheap hits but you have to but only in those games it feels natural and if you got hit by some cheap shots then... it's your fault. Sure if you're doing repeat runs of this game and have a very very good memory of what events are going to trigger (seriously there is so much. I do love the determination the crew had for adding so much stuff to this game but... dial it down a tad bit) then your experience will be slightly better. I've gone on and on about the biggest flaw of this game so I just wanna end off with praise for it. I really love this game, it's super charming, tons of well respectable call backs, the art direction is really damn good, story is simple to the point, the music!!! ***Does a sexy pose to my Yuzo Koshiro poster while I kiss my streets of rage games.*** lol haha, the attention to detail is fantastic, n tho i'e said too much content made this game too bloated and frustrating... I can't help but appreciate the work this indie team has put into. Alot of love and care has been put into this game but when I was thinking of how others struggle with this game I do wish there was an easy difficulty option or have an adaptive difficulty program feature added like in Resident Evil 4. Worthy entry to the series (just have patience to the end) 8/10 -SOHusky. I made the mistake of buying this game based on reviews. It's one of the most frustrating games I've ever played. You die almost instantly. The gear is totally useless even the golden one, 2 - 3 hits from an enemy and you are dead. Some of the challenges are not fun at all, you just keep dying until you finish them, there is absolutely no logic in them. Switching gear is just terrible also navigation on the map. The only nice part is the art work and the colors. Don't buy it unless you just want to enjoy tons of frustrating moments.. This game is literal garbage. I'm not sure which is worst, the story, the gameplay, or the progression. It is all simply pure garbage.. Absolutely amazing! Must play for any Metroidvania fans! The story is very charming. The level design is creative and fun! And the challenge is a perfect balance! The music is amazing and the graphics is outstanding!. The best Wonder Boy game ever made! Everything about this game just oozes charm and effort. I can't think of a single Metroidvania that has impressed me this much!. A game I really enjoyed playing. The difficulty can be a bit high sometimes but never hitting a frustrating point. The places/dungeons you go through are different and each will bring new tricks and items. I loved the creativity coming from the combined story, soundtracks and art work. I didn't play Wonderboy however I am a big fan of platform and adventure games and this one truly delivered. Another ""detail"" I would mention is the collectibles that are well included in the game. There is a variety of armors with improvements that can help in dungeons, the music sheets,... and the drops that can help complete the game at 100%. All in all, the hours I spent on this game were fun and I would highly recommend it. A top of the notch homage to the Wonder Boy games on Master System and Mega Drive. Right at the beginning you can hear the initial tune of Wonder Boy in Monster Land, the first game of the franchise with RPG elements. You definitely know you're playing a Wonder Boy game, even if it doesn't carry the name. An improvement to Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap is to be able to change back and forth between the animal appearances at almost any moment as soon the orbs enabling the different morphs are obtained. Furthermore many puzzles are added to the known formula of the franchise it refers to. The graphics and animations are colourful and anime-like, the sounds and musics are of excellent quality and the game is fun to play. The only downsides I see are the rather lifeless animations of the frog swimming and that some parts are pretty cryptic as in: How should I know I need the golden sword to destroy certain blocks at the end of the game? In the end it's an excellent platformer with some backtracking and many references to the Wonder Boy games, even the first which is quite different to its sequels.. I found this game very underwhelming, though it should be said that I'm not a follower of the whole game series (although I did play Wonderboy on the Amiga 500 back in the day). I found it slow paced, really imprecise and boring combat, dull and ""blocky"" platforming, the whole package is just very ... it's for kids and/or fans, basically.. Nice gameplay and visuals... That is all. Ohhh and race at the end (I'll know when you see) is just idiotic with switch controllers (frog part). Music - rubbish Controlling - bad Storyline - none existing Kids friendly - NO way! This game is as kids friendly as ET game on Amiga - I mean, it looks like it must be (because of cool title etc) but it absolutely is not. I do not like it and even though I played all game I regret buying it.. If you love platforming and '90s nostalgia then this game should be on your radar. If you are anyone else be cautioned this game is hard. ""This is my revised review as I have since finished it"" The game starts off pretty tough once you turn into your first monster, but if you can whether the storm for about half the game there is something addicting, at least addicting enough to want to finish. I truly hated this game for the first half of the game, but after collecting items and upgrading equipment it started to become kind of fun. There are still moments where it really ticked me off and I wanted to smash the controller, but I stuck through and glad I did. My advice if you're interested in this game, that would be don't take the video reviewers at there word, when they say this game is great, it's not great, well at least not great if you only have a passing interest in platforming, otherwise they're probably right. While I enjoyed it at the end I still don't agree with all the praise, It really becomes frustrating unless you're really a die hard platformer gamer. This should have been pointed out, I don't know how or why it wasn't. At the end The game made me much better at platformers so That's pretty cool. Because of that and The surprising amount of fun I was having after I unlocked most of my forms and upgrading my equipment, I'm bumping up my original score from a ""4"" to a ""6 out of 10"". Slightly above middle of the road depending on what kind of gamer you are. If you want a challenge this game will challenge you, if you want to relax this game will not be you're go too for such. At the end of the day I'm glad I purchased it, I beat my first platformer and now im much better at them.. This game's absolute gorgeous, stunning visuals and a lot stuff to do. This game nowadays (like was in my childhood) is one of my favorite games. Monster Boy fit better in switch console instead anothers plataforms. Well, I confess that didnt believed in this Monster **** fact the master system wonder boy was one of my first game have played in '90. Trought a bunch of years I played Wonder Boy Dragon's Trap and Wonder Boy Remaster Remix that be amazing games but NOTHING if compared with MB in the cursed kingdom.. Oh my days.. this game! Despite its colourful cute graphics and jolly soundtrack, this is anything but bright and cheerful when you knuckle down and actually play it! I’m pretty sure it’s one of the most frustrating, tedious and downright unfair platform games I’ve ever played! It’s not just a difficult game, it’s physically impossible to get through large sections of it without repeat dying to learn what to do next, it’s mind numbing.. Which wouldn’t actually be so bad if you didn’t have to go so far back in some sections just to get back to where you died last time. And then, by the time you reach where you previously died, and with the little life you have left again, if you don’t make a perfect move you have to start all over filled with pure anger! I’m actually getting into a rage now just thinking about it, so I’ll leave it there... So anyway, be warned. Not much ‘fun’ to be had here which is a shame. Get Dragons Trap instead that was awesome. Grrr.... It pretends to be a sequel of the Wonderboy's Saga but it fails the legacy. A basic metroidvania full of trial-and-error platform sessions, never very inspired, just copied from other titles. The Art Direction is childish and the animations are very bad. The only thing that saves the game is the nostalgia effect, in fact the game is full of easter eggs and old theme songs.. Criminally underrated game. A real gem, just a super fun and well thought out game. Perfect level of difficulty to keep you engaged and feel accomplished without being too punishing. If Zelda, mega Man and kid chameleon had a baby, it would be monster boy.. Impossible to recommend. The game had uneven difficulty until it becomes kick your teeth in brutally hard. Looks great. Plays well. Ok design with some stupidity (soft locks in poorly thought out puzzles). But that late game difficulty is so the opposite of the fun and cheery visuals I would save your money. The Sega remake of the old master system game is better.. If you did enjoy a 80's childhood properly, arcades, video games and stuff like that, you know the Monster Boy franchise and if you got it into it, you loved it and if you loved it then, you gonna love Monster Boy And The Cursed Kingdom! All the magic is here, with nice graphics, polished gameplay and controls, a superb soundtrack, seriously, buy it, do yourself this favor! 10 out 10!. I'm not sure why this game is so highly rated. The platforming is frustrating. Not hard, just frustrating. The art is nice, but the animation is terrible. The controls are sluggish. And it doesn't bring anything new to the metroidvania genre. Why is the map not visible at the same time? Why is it such a pain to switch gear? I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't.. Played it until the 100%. This game is so fantastic I had to buy it day-1 on PC to 100% it again. Monster Boy is one of my favorite Metroidvanias of all time so don't miss this adventure-filled pure gem!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I wanted to love this game more than I did. I still had a good time with it but I can't say it's a must-play. I keep seeing people call this a MetroidVania and I don't think that's quite right... The structure is actually much closer to a Zelda game than a MetroidVania. There's a village in the middle of the map and you venture out in different directions to tackle a long list of self-contained dungeons. You constantly acquire new gear and monster-transformations that allow you to traverse new areas and solve more puzzles. There are secrets everywhere and the main quest could take you upwards of 20 hours to finish. That somewhat makes up for the 40 dollar price tag but compared to some indie games, Monster Boy falls short. Blossom Tales is a better Zelda clone, with a grander sense of adventure and Hollow Knight is a far better MetroidVania with better combat and infinitely superior level design and both games are much cheaper than Monster Boy. It delivers some good puzzles and platforming but the linearity and weak combat dragged it down for me. One major flaw that almost ruined the game for me is the health system. It is just impossible to get your health back. Enemies will drop health occasionally but it's nowhere near enough to compensate for the damage they'll do to you. The platforming and puzzles can also drain your health in a hurry. You can buy and upgrade shields and armor but it never seemed to make much of a difference. By my count, there are 3 ways around the health system. You can go back to a store to purchase a health potion, which is often very out of your way and will waste a lot of time. However, you actually keep all of your progress when you die so you can usually just brute force it until you win (frustrating), or kill yourself after using your potion to get it back (tedious and immersion-breaking). All 3 of these strategies are a pain in the butt and easily could have been remedied by enemies simply dropping more health. I'm all for challenge, I already recommended you play Hollow Knight instead of this game. The important difference is that this game's challenge comes from tedium. Another user review mentioned the Volcano dungeon and this was the exact moment where the game fell apart for me too, almost entirely because of the health system. I know it seems ridiculous for me to spend half my review talking about health but it really turned the game into a slog in the second half and made me question how good the first half had actually been. It never stops your progress outright but it's always a lingering annoyance. Monster Boy is a Nintendo-style side-scrolling adventure that has a lot going for it but can never quite reach the heights of the big N.. I have fond memories of playing the game on Master System with my brother, and I enjoyed the remake a lot, so I had high hopes for this. And in regards to animation and artwork, the game delivers - it looks gorgeous. But the game mechanics are so bad, I dropped it after few hours. Many of its flaws seem like botched features from the original. For example, in the original, enemies sometimes reappeared from outside the screen - here, they just pop up out of thin air, right next to you. Or the ""puzzles"", where it pretty much tells you which form you need to change to next: In the original, you could instantly change form only towards the end of the game, which allowed you to explore freely. Here, it is a core mechanic of the game, and half of your time is spent switching to the next form in a sequence the game shows you - become snake to enter hole, become frog to leap upwards, become snake again to exit through hole. Since it takes a bit of time to change form (there even is a noticeable lag when you change using the menu), it is just tedious. Overall it feels like the game does not rely on skill, but on patience. You fail a lot of challenges because you grew impatient at the third or fourth repetition, and the game punishes you by setting you back to zero. It is mind-numbing. Ultimately, I wonder who this game is for. It is too hard for children, but too linear and simplistic for adults. I wanted to like this, but I thoroughly didn't.. I came in expecting a successor to 'Wonderboy : the dragon's trap' that I enjoyed a lot. And in some aspects this game really delivers : the soundtrack is nice, the character design and animations are flawless. The scenario is pretty conventional and without surprises, and the cutscenes a bit too ""talky"" to my tastes but still fine. However, when in Wonderboy the level design felt hard but rewarding, there are lots of time where I felt that MonsterBoy was actively punishing me for playing it. From ennemies that remove 2/3 of your life bar in one hit to ennemies that respawn without warning ON THE CHARACTER, there are a lot of times where I was about to throw my console on the ground. Some parts of the game lit a pure and undistilled rage in my heart until I unlocked a specific power, by which time it becomes trivial. In general, past the first dungeon, there's really no in-between in this game : either you die a thousand times on the same screen or it is totally trivial. Most checkpoints don't refill your lifebar, and you restart at the last checkpoint with only a small portion of your hearts, which means most of the time you're chain-dying and reloading only to get one-shot a few screens down the road. I thoroughly enjoyed Hollow Knight and Wonderboy. I can handle a hard game. But *this* is not hard. This is *pain*.. Pros Detailed 2D graphics, bright and vivid Good soundtrack Cons Frustratingly difficult at times Pro controller recommended I have never seen a game more unfairly given praise than this game, Monster Boy is honestly a complete mixed bag. I honestly think bl1rt review is fairly accurate, Monster Boy is a brutally punishing game that rewards the patient player rather than charging head on into all the outlandish and often, frustrating puzzles. There are literally respawn points all over the place, and seemly few during difficult and downright frustrating puzzle or pixel perfect platforming scenes where dying is all too easy and some areas are so difficult that they require exceptionally fast reflexes to change form/jump/special/change form/special etc etc to get through some puzzles and again honestly.... The stock controller makes it even more frustrating, this is totally best played with a pro controller, just to save on some of the more frustrating areas. Boss battles are really easy, yes you might die once or twice but once you figure out the pattern they become a literally a cakewalk, which is a shame because you could die 500 times trying to reach the boss battle. I would be wary of this title, even for Metroidvania and fans of Wonderboy series in general, this requires patience rather than skill, and more importantly requires a cool head because it will frustrate you quite often as several areas are down right evil in terms of difficulty. Some monster forms like pig are annoying, and it takes a fair while before you start to unlock other forms. Enemies often are placed in areas where they can spring out of thin air to instantly damage you with giving you absolutely no chance to react, unless you already died to them and know they are there! This aspect is unfortunate because the early sequences of the game are exceptionally difficult due to limited form options, once the game opens up more it does get better until later in the game where a few more areas become frustrating again.. This game is a dream come true for me, I've been waiting a long time for a game with Wonder Boy III style gameplay. This game blew away all my expectations and delivered awesome platforming gold. The graphics are amazingly detailed, the music is phenomenal and the world is nicely fleshed out more than previous Wonder Boy games. The obvious criticism is that it is a bit too hard, it's easy to get lost or confused about what to do next. I embarrassingly got stuck for 30 minutes in the church trying to figure out what to do in there to progress the game. I spent another 40 minutes trying to find an optional hidden room in one of the dungeons. I also encountered a puzzle where I had a solution that should have worked, but the game seemed to not accept my solution and wanted me to find its intended solution. I think some of these puzzles should have more clues to help the player if they get stuck or there should be more than one solution to some of them. Also starting over with just 3 hearts from the last checkpoint is kind of a joke, it's very difficult to progress with just 3 hearts from a checkpoint, especially later in the game like in the fire area where there is fire everywhere. Yes there is a time-comsuming way to heal yourself that I won't get into due to spoilers, but I think if you started with more hearts - maybe half your max hearts (if that's greater than 3) at checkpoints it would make a lot more sense. Or just space out the checkpoints more and make more of them fully heal you. Or have Zeke deliver a potion to you after respawning too many times. Or make an easy mode where all the checkpoints heal you perhaps. Anyway, despite the difficult sections, the large majority of the game i","the controls could have been refined a tad but the overall vibe, it just nails what it's trying to do . pretty much a miserable experience from start to finish. Cheap enemy design and placement. Many enemies fly through walls and floors making them invulnerable ."
89.Gran Turismo 2,"holds up great after 24 years and a lot of content and driving feels pretty realistic for the time, and you have a lot of tuning options. good soundtrack, great selection of cars, really good tracks. a 10/10 timeless classic.. This game is afwul, the gameplay ****, no dpad steering wich i love, graphics didn't change at all, UI looks the same as in GT1 but with lower saturation, i don't recommend playing on the PS1 or on Duckstation emulator.. It takes GT1, and improves upon it in every way. Track count? More than doubled. Car count? Over quadrupled! Visuals? Vastly improved over the first game. Physics? Better there too, with more accurate vehicle handling than the original. GT2 also adds a rally mode to the game including the famous Pikes Peak Hillclimb in all it's pixelated glory. The only reason this game doesn't have a 10, is because a rushed development cycle left a few annoying bugs in the final release. One of which is that when tuning your suspension, the ride height is labeled as ""inches"" but the units weren't converted from millimeters, so the game ends up telling you your car's ride height is 130 inches. Just little nitpicks like that, it's a little rough around the edges but it's a phenomenal game despite that.. Gran Turismo 2, in its Greatest Hits, fixes all of the bugs that plagued the original release while maintaining the classic, career-driven feel of the already massive game. Improving on the original in the best way possible, this is the ultimate swan song for the PSone.. This game,is a revolution. Even for know you can enjoy it as long as you are familiar with ps1 graphics. It's a really great racing game, with a great gameplay, the best progression system, and for it's time really good graphics.. Firstly I will start with the pros, the game looks great for 1999 and still to this day, and the car collection is enormous, but there is a lot of cons. The ai are so hard when you slightly brake into a corner the ai will zoom past at the speed of light, I can’t even win the FF Challenge with how hard the ai is, also there are no cheats which makes this game virtually Impossible. I bought this game for $20 at a Game X Change and I must say it was definitely worth it. I have spent a long time just playing the game for myself. And me and my dad have had tons of fun just horsing around.. A complete revolution in car video games. With street cars and not just luxury supercars. Best PSX Gran Turismo with 2 discs.. This was the game that brought me into racing games! Loved in when I was a child, love it now when I am an adult. Gran Turismo 2 is a 1999 racing simulation video game developed by Polyphony Digital and published by Sony.. My favourite Gran Turismo, it was a fun and deep game, amazing times learning how to tune in my Scudo and destroying the competition. Amazing times that will never die!. It just hasn't aged very well, it's still a decent game and the multiplayer is fun. .. This game is literally the GOAT. THE GOAT. Unreal for its time. A true king of a champion. I won't have a bad word spoken about it.. Clearly, this is the best Gran Turismo game, Its a Gran Turismo game without all the fluff that can make GT4 a tedious experience, less license tests, no 24 hour endurance races that I just end up leaving the game on to play itself overnight just so I can get the 100%, the ai doesnt just hold its line and actually makes the game challenging, even though the rubber banding can be annoying in its own right.. This game was a marvel of it's time. It was an instant classic and it still holds up incredibly good. Stop reading and go play it!. This is the definitive racing game for the first PlayStation. I still come back to play this after first time playing it some odd 20 years ago and it still delivers.. This game may be over 20 years old, but holds up to today's standards, and even smashes them by doing almost everything better than any racing game that came out since the 8th generation began. Its only shortcoming being the graphics, originating from the Playstation 1, it is obvious. But that's subjective. A first-time player might find it hard on the eyes, but for someone who's played it for years, it's like coming back home. Gran Turismo 2 excels at everything else : - Its large car list, with a count of over 500 cars (counting some repeats, fair) - Its tuning potential, which can turn virtually any regular traffic car into a full race car, a game mechanic that has been replicated only a handful of times since. - Its extensive career. - Its challenging but fair difficulty, bringing actual close racing. - Its diversified track list, both on paved and dirt roads, with noted elevation changes. If you could only play one single game for the rest of your life, Gran Turismo 2 is one that is sure to keep you busy and entertained for a long while.. Gran Turismo 2 is the best PS1 racing game and probably the most important in the series. This game will convert you to Jazz and Japanese cars wether you like it or not.. This Game Is Awesome, It Deserves Every Good Review About It, The Cars, The Tracks, The Racing And The Car Wash, The Best Thing In This Game Lol. Good game, it has a great car list, great events, great tracks, if it wasn't rushed for the 1999 holiday then it could've been even better. but even then its great. Way ahead of its time. Hundreads of cars, amazing tracks and just like its prequel great soundtrack and even better graphics and physique. Best game on the system.. if GT4 doesn't exist, dthis would've been the greatest racing game of all time, truly fascinating. 2nd best game in the universe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Aged like a fine wine. Improves on everything from GT1 with a insane amount of content for a ps1 game. 10/10 soundtrack too, especially the PAL version. Best racing game I've ever played, love how the cars handle and the tracks are amazing. Graphics are absolutely beautiful.. This, Gran Turismo 3, and Gran Turismo 4 make up the trifecta of the greatest racing games ever.. I am writing to you from the future, GT 7 has just been released and is crawling with a diesease called microtransactions. Gran Turismo is officially dead, long live GT 2.. When it came out it was mind blowing how long the game was along with the amount of cars you can buy. This game was an amazing move forward in the racing genre.. Well, i wasnt expected too much since i also didnt like GT1. But now straight to the positives and negatives. First of all, this game like its predecessor it looks INCREDIBLE, easily one of the best looking games on the PS1, even surprass some early PS2 racing games, but there´s specific places where it looks worse than GT1, but i can understand that, since this game has more cars and tracks, so it gets a pass. Still 10/10 graphics, although what doesnt get a pass is the map in the main menu that looks very bland but still a minor issue. Second, you have an INSANE amount of cars, like 500 or 600 in a PS1 GAME!!! Even today racing games would dream with that quantity, and while the handling is still very stiff (in fact, i would say is much more rigid than GT1) they remove a lot the oversteer of the car, so it gets a pass. It could control much better, but is still a decent handling nonthenless. Now the negatives, and honestly, i think this makes the game much worse to play than GT1. The grinding.... good lord... the grinding in this game is TERRIBLE! In GT1 you dont have to win much races to buy cars or upgrades, but in this game you have to win like 4-8 races to make some few upgrades on your car, and the races itself are a lot more harder than GT1, mainly because the of the issue that i mentioned in my GT1 review, the AI could turn without the need to brake sometimes. Well, in GT2 is practically all the time, and in every turn while you are braking, the AI could catch you, and this is much more noticed if you pick up a bad car to start the game, you will find yourself losing a lot of races because the AI would be faster than you in straights and sharp corners, and the money that they give you for winning a race is pathetic. This reminds me to the first Choro Q game, but at least in that game they make you clear that you have to actually grind, making only the first opponent much more faster than you, and they give you a lot of money and the races itself were FUN, while in GT2 the track design is much more forgettable than 1 and the soundtrack wasnt as memorable imo. The padding also returns, recycling the tracks from GT1, recycling the tracks from GT2 constantly in mid game, and the return of the 2 hours tracks. The much more longer loading times (even in menus) and the return of the licenses also dont help either. Now the rally races.... Good lord, if the races in road have clunky controls, now in the rally races unless you get a very good car is just so bad, and this races take up like half (or slighty less) of the game. They demand you absolutely perfection even in the first races, this also applies to the licenses, because even if their are like i said before a lot easier than the first game, that doesnt mean they arent still hard, and while i hate it less more than the first one, the developers putted much more license challenges, and the padding is just so bad... Rally, licenses, repetition of tracks, 2 hours tracks, HP limit for certain races, grinding, and everything else, this game is just full of padding. While this also was an issue for GT1, it wasnt too bad to be honest, the game was much more simple and once you got all the licenses there wasnt too much events in the game, so GT1 was padded, yes, but short. The developers tried to make a much more ambitious game, but without solving the previous game flaws their ended making a even more flawed game. While GT1 have terrible controls, at least i have some fun since the grinding and the normal races were ok (except the last ones of course). GT2 isnt a bad game by any means, but rather a game that sucumbed for being too ambitious. Like i said with the first game, this feels like another technical demo, only worth playing because for the novelty of the time, and not for having fun today.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If I had to play one game for the rest of my life, this would be it. Despite the bugs, I absolutely love it. Still my favourite game from the entire franchise.. This game was unbelievable. I played countless hours and stayed up many nights farming money for cars and stuff. Very memorable OST and amazing courses. I'm excited for GT7. I hope it brings some of that charm back which I didn't feel since GT5.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best race game for ps1 and probably in every platform for this generation back in the days. Really good game.. Played on PlayStation. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT.. My childhood passion for cars in video games started here. NFS Porsche Unleashed and F1 2000 were other classics that defined my love for Motorsport. But no other racing game came close to the grandeur and magic and passion gran turismo 2 implemented.. A fantastic racing ""simcade"" title featuring a wide array of licensed cars, race tracks (real and fantasy), quick fast paced races, and one of the best soundtracks ever featured in any game. This game almost single handedly made me a motorsport fan and made me more interested in the inner workings of real life cars. The graphics were also fantastic for the time and constraints of the original Playstation, although they don't really hold up today. Still, it's a must play for anybody even remotely interested in motorsport or racing games.. This is really a great game, there is so much to love about it, must play for sure!. The greatest car racing game ever made! One of the greatest video games ever made! While the graphics seem choppy and the handling seems crude during the first few hours of game play, this game becomes a gem with time. The one problem GT2 does have is the need for a ""game wheel"". No matter what you do with a hand held controller, your race time will always be improved with the use **** wheel.. Gran Turismo 2 was a best racing game in ps1 . it was great . i remember i trying to win a game but i will field. Simulation mode too, sirs! Get it! A huge improvement on graphics and a lot of new cars make this a masterpiece. Pure fun.. Amazing game, this was a referent for racing games to come, the inclusion on the rally with those physics were key to the success. even now i enjoy a lot playing it.. This was the best racing game on PlayStation 1. Also, possibly the best game of PS1 in general. You are a driver who participates in races to buy new cars, install upgrades on cars. It takes many dozens if not hundreds of races until you can buy the best car in the game. However, despite the modest number of race tracks (about a dozen), the races don't feel too repetitive because they feel different at different speeds (in different car classes), sometimes they are reversed, or some parts of the track are different, and there are also ""endurance"" races where your tires wear out and you run 25+ laps. The game is overall pretty hard and the physics of the cars feels realistic. Often if just one wheel touches dirt, the whole car may start spinning and run off the track. Even to start the races, the game requires you to pass 30 training levels (""licences"") which teach you to manage sharp turns at high speed and such. This sets the game far apart from the more casual/arcade Need for Speed series. Gran Turismo is demanding to your skill, and you get a feeling of accomplishment when you win races, as they are always hard wins.. It is a very fun game, but cars were quite slow, Although 9 because of MORE CARS, MORE MAPS, cannot add more, that's my review, metacritic wants me to add more, OVERALL: FUN GAME. My favourite PS1 Racing game without doubt, because there are ton of interesting cars, nice courses, fun career mode and awesome soundtrack! Nostalgic graphics, and challenging in a fun way. You can even tune your car like you wish, and obatin nice prizes and cars when racing to the 1st place. Ton of fun, ton of good memories, that's what i call a real game!. When I was a kid I played almost 4 hours daily. In that year I think that was the best racing game you can get. Wow. Every single part of this game just screams fun.. Definitive the best car game you can get on Playstation 1. Excellent car sounds, interesting licences, unforgetable music, great performance system, many cool cars to choose, and exciting courses. A really memorable game!. When I ordered this game, I was expecting it to be very fun and at most, vaguely frustrating. However, I was completely wrong. It first took me an hour to get my first licence which annoyed me. I was then only given $10,000 to spend on a car. I searched around ALL the garages (I must have been doing it for at least 45 minutes) and I couldn't find an affordable car so I had to buy a 1996 Toyota to plough me through the first few events. Now onto the racing. The most annoying thing about the racing is that your position can change from 1st to 6th in NO TIME AT ALL, which just frustrates me to the bone. You could be 5 seconds away from winning a race, when suddenly a mob of cars from behind you come and steal your position you worked hard for. The car can't be controlled with the analog stick (which is dumb when you consider that a PS1 controller with an analog stick had been out for 2 years when the game was released) so you have to use the d-pad which is terrible for steering because you CONSTANTLY swerve off the track. I swear to God, this game frustrates me so much that I one time yelled at the box and almost broke it. Sometimes it gets so bad, I feel like snapping the disc. Thank God I only paid £3.49 for it.. This game was one of the most complete racing games of all time. It came with a multitude of cars and tracks, if only racing games now could live up to this standard, I wish they would just remake this game with better graphics because it is damn near perfect.. GT2 has everything GT had but more and better. Includes more cars, more tracks and even the new rally mode. The soundtrack was pretty good and the steering was just exquisite. True classic.. Fantastic game.. The greatest racing for the PlayStation and better than the original!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","a rushed development cycle left a few annoying bugs in the final release . graphics didn't change at all, UI looks the same as in GT1 but with lower saturation . graphics didn't change at all, i don't recommend playing on the ps1 or on duckstation emulator ."
890.BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger,"My favorite fighting game. Never get boring and lovely to play with friends. Al characters are based on metal music and the soundtrack is awesome. Every anime game lover should buy this game. Animations are perfect. But there is one thing i i disliked. There are not many characters. But a fighting game that has a nice story? Never saw it before. Beautiful game, however not the best fighting game on the market. The anime characters are a bit clichÃ and expectable, that aside the game is enjoyable whenever you play it online or with your friends in the versus mode. If you are a fan of fighting games, you should consider this into your collection. If you're a casual gamer that likes anime characters in fighting games, consider BlazBlue.","the anime characters are a bit clich and expectable, but aside the game is enjoyable . if you are a casual gamer that likes anime characters in fighting games, consider BlazBlue ."
891.Saints Row IV,"It's so funny and senseless, the gameplay is great. This is the perfect partner of GTA. This game has nothing to do with Saints **** should be a funny DLC for 3rd installment and it shows. Nothing is good in this ""game"". Avoid at all costs.. story funny haha very super power big like, combat much different its a nice addition 9/10. graphics still the same kinda just ok 6/10, characters i like its sort of mass effectish the way u get everyone onto your team and then do a mission for them they fkna copied mass effect 3/10 actually. The best Saints Row game, the story, humor, music, and gameplay is on point. From beginning to end enjoyable.. As its own game, sure, it's fun. But it takes the craziness of Saints Row 3 to levels that just aren't even enjoyable anymore. Decent game, but terrible Saints Row.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My favorite Saints row game, people are **** about super powers but like hello?? they were AWESOME! Story was good gameplay was good everything was good fun jokes were on point songs were good too the part where we sang with pierce ''opposites attract'' is still on my all time favorite moments i laughed so hard when Zinyak joined the singing.. Highly recommend. Saints Row expands on 3 by adding aliens and superpowers making the gameplay just incrediblly fun and revisting different style of games and eras with rescuing your friends keeps the game fresh and exciting. You also get to be president of the United States. The story is weaker than 3 but still enjoyable and you can argue they took the ridiculousness too far, but that's something you should decide for yourself.. I picked this up right after finishing the third. And i have so many mixed feelings. First of all the beginning of the game feels good. cars drive nicely shooting is satisfying. But after a longer playtime game showed me it's weaknesses. All the missions felt like copy and paste of the previous one only with changed place that the mission takes place in. You encounter mostly the same enemies with little to no variety. And when you do encounter someone new, game gives you the option to stop them right away. Superpower system feels good but it seems like they had higher ambitions and didn't met them. Personally through my playthrough i have used only freeze power up because it was the most efficient one. during endgame i used other powers (not counting buff) tens of times. Loyalty missions are fun but they are optional so you don't have to even do them. Rescuing missions are also fun but this all happens so late into the game. By the end of it i had to force myself to finish the game cuz it was randomly crashing during cutscenes. So even if i wanted to know something about a lore i couldn't because game was more likely to crash and lose my progress of the mission. Thankfully they aren't long but when game crashes like 5 times during couple last missions it just feels unfair. All the side missions given by the rescued characters make the game very easy. To the point that in first hour of playing i had close close to infinite stamina because i had a power up that makes sprint not consume any. Closer to the end of the game all the side content feels needed because when you start last mission your undeveloped character seems too weak during last boss fight. Upgrade menu feels useless apart from additional ammo and maybe health. Weapon upgrades are cool but feels useless when you have freeze power that lets you instantly smash any normal opponent. Game just feels at some places unfinished.. it was a biproduct of saints row 3, but actually it excels many points.. It's a fun game, but that's all. It's mediocre in many ways. Not to be played with high expectations.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. I never played the original Saints Row. I started with SR3 and enjoyed that a lot. I went back to play SR2 (with the Gentlemen of the Row mod), and enjoyed that as well. I could see in SR2 where Volition had a lot of GTA influence. In SR3 it seemed like they no longer wanted to be just a GTA-clone, though, and started finding ways to distinguish themselves from GTA. Whereas GTA stayed on the ""realism"" route, Volition apparently decided to take the batguano-over-the-top-insane route for SR. SR3 accomplished this by adding an ultra high-tech paramilitary organization with futuristic weapons and vehicles. With SRIV, the link to reality was wholly severed. Instead of zombies and lasers, you get super powers: speed, jumping, and gliding, to name some of the basics. One drawback to these super powers is they invalidate/supersede much of the content that the genre was built on. The wide varieties of vehicles and weapons in the game become all but useless. There's no point upgrading your pistol or SMG when you can just super-punch an enemy in the **** to instakill him. Satisfying as it may be, it gets old and tedious fairly quickly. Another disappointment with SRIV is that it inherited perhaps too much of SR3. From a story standpoint it's understandable why the same city is reused, but there were practically no improvements to it. Like a band that experiments with different genres & sounds from album to album, Volition experimented with adding surrealism to the GTA base formula with each subsequent Saints Row game. It was fun while it lasted. Problem is now: what direction do you take the franchise after Playa/Boss has tasted super powers and killed aliens?. My first and probably last Saints Row game. Had some fun at the beginning, say for 6 hours, with a super-powered GTA experience, but then it started to get old. I think they went too far with sexuality, including LGBTQ material that felt almost pornographic. The humor is not really funny for me, it felt more like delirium. Humor is great from time to time, but not all the time. I did finish the game and DLC just to get to the end, but not really because I was interested.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. I don't know what to say about this game. But Saints Row IV is one of the most craziest, over-the-top, high-defying, grand smashing, and amazing video games I ever played. This is one of my current favorite games on Steam and my most current favorite Saints Row game. I have seen a plumber who can jump high or a hedgehog who goes super fast but I have never seen a street gang leader becoming president of the United States of America. This game is like Grand Theft Auto added with Prototype, Metal Gear, Streets of Rage, Star Wars, and Star Fox with a sprinkle of Superhero Science Fiction. The story may be a little insane but this game has returning characters from the old games of Saints Row 1-3 and turning the usual street gang game into a president fighting aliens to avenge earth. The activities are creative and mostly use superpowers. One of my favorite activities is Fight Club also known as the Super Power Fight Club because you can take on multiple waves of enemies with superpowers and take out bosses that are returning characters Some costumes in the game maybe have no effects but it's the perfect way to get dressed to kill there are some costumes missing in the inauguration station like the president's suit. But my 2nd favorite is the Nyte Blade outfit because it feels more hack-and-slash-like but a little beat em up The combat of using melee attacks is fun and usable when I am strong enough. Powers that makes things unbelievably eye-catching, Weapons and weapon are amazing looking while others are just strangely made. And the best part is that all DLC together with the game is super cheap. It's like buying the tastiest cheapest pizza pie with all toppings. In conclusion, I 100% recommend playing this game.. fun & cool game but i had a lot of crashes !!! tried to fix but never worked ... miss a first person view i would give a 8/10 if game would be more stable & have fps feature .... i **** hate deep silver, stop touching saints row and making it a fictional buggy alien mess. This game is trying way too hard to be funny, yet it's so scripted and makes me cringe at times. The only thing I like about this game is the cheats and takedowns.. Gameplay - 10/10 Characters - 9.25/10 Visuals - 9/10 Story - 8/10 Uniqueness - 9.5/10. Disgusting ugly trash **** Disgusting ugly trash **** Disgusting ugly trash **** Disgusting ugly trash ****. hey, its not saints row 3. story: 6.7/10 combat: 5/10 superpowers: 10/10 weapons: 9/10 fun: 7.8/10. Sorry, but positive feedback is not available in your region. At least until your leadership changes the two-faced policy in their actions and statements.. The graphics are practically the same as in 3. However, the idea of ​​the game is completely different, leaving the GTA style for something with super powers. I particularly liked this game too.. beautiful game, I will never forget it, created heroes, a lot of crashes, humor, references to pop culture, great opportunities to edit characters and being super, probably a few more times I will pass this game, one of my favorites for sure, only sent recently that it is a budget project and was supposed to be dlc to three. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Bad optimization on PC. The game overall is a 7, but after playing saints row 3, you realize how much of lazy carbon copy this game is. Everything is the absolute same, the only new improvement are the super powers which I found super fun, with those superpowers however, vehicles become obsolete, weapons too actually. In one area of the map every **** is copy pasted, such lazy developers. Every mission is tedious and boring and is the exact same formula all the **** time I went insane. Don't play this if you have played other saints row, I do recommend gat out of hell though.. It's a very repetitive game with an interesting premise. I just wish the gameplay was as interesting as the story... Revised part: After 12 hours more my opinion still stands. I've played through the DLC as well and while a fun distraction, they don't add anything overall. I wish I could say more nice things about this game...Finally please go through the guide of not making the game crash on your computer! Mine crashed every 2 hours so I had to stop and restart the game to prevent that from happening, even after the fix... its all about humor and entertainment, the game is just gta with superpowers if you didn't play any other saints row game. +Storyline +Superpowers +Co-op -kinda glitchy?. For something that was originally intended as an expansion, Saints Row 4 suprisingly manages to stand on it's own as a main series entry. Going from the already over the top tone of The Third to an alien invasion is certaintly quite a jump in tone, and while it is even more ridiculous compared to SR3, and disappointing that it didnt tone it down and go back to the more grounded tone of Saints Row 1 and 2, i'd be lying if i said that it wasnt still a decent experience. In my opinion the game is even somewhat of an improvement over SR3 in some areas, but it was kind of exhausting to go back to the same generic Steelport again, albeit with a few alien additions to make it more fun to explore in the simulation. At it's core SR4 is the same game as it's predecessor, just with superpowers. They are fun to use and instantly become your preferred way to traverse the simulation, making travel by vehicles virtually irrelevant. However the powers that help you in combat i found less attractive to use, since they can become so OP that they rob the challenge, especially later in the game. One thing that i didnt expect to like was collecting all the clusters that serve as currency to improve your powers, i mean they should be tedious and tiresome to collect, but somehow they're not. There are a lot of new and different weapons with all the DLC included, but majority of them are just skins for the weapon archetypes. The story and missions, just like in SR3, are again the overall saving grace of the game. Zinyak is a fun and charming villain, and all the stuff you need to go through to get to him is quite fun. In the midst of it the game's story relies quite a bit on nostalgic trip down the original 2 games, but that was ok by me, since it was fun seeing and interacting with the legacy characters in some capacity. Unfortunately the main story isnt that long and the game takes a very liberal use of side activities in an attempt to lengthen it.. Everything is fine, except for one city and additional quests, class abilities, the soundtrack also let us down, the engine is not optimized. I remember when I bought it in a store on disk, in 2013, this game did not interest me very much. But, now, I remembered about it, and try to go through it again... It's incredible! I've been through a lot of games in my entire gaming life, and no matter how it sounds, I don't regret that I didn't pass it then, because I can enjoy it right now!. +10 because every game could be a 10 -1 You sound is bugging out? If you have an Nvdia card, you can adjust the individual setting for every game. What you have to do here is lower the FPS to 30 and put Vsynch to ""Fast"". And the fact that I looked that up for an 8 year old game and played it for 40 hours straight for the fourth time makes it kind of one of my top five games of the past 30 years. It's fun. Spoil yourself and give it a shot.. It got ridiculous storyline and I love it. Presentation is funny and there are some cool references. Superpowers are really fun. You wreck everyone and everything. On top of that there are also some nice and interesting weapons to use. Atmosphere is really weak. Npc's are copy pasted and like robots and overall city feels dead. It also uses the same map from 3 with not enough change. It is over the top and most fun saints row.. saints row 4 pros good story mode great powers good change from sr3 by far cons none. Imagine taking meth and thinking you have super powers, that's Saints Row IV in a nutshell. More of Steelport from Saints Row III, but taken over by aliens in a simulation while the real world was destroyed by aliens, yes, aliens are the main antagonists of Saints Row IV. The arsenal is the strongest in Saints Row history, boasting a staggering amount of weapons including a **** and tentacle bat you can shove up the asses of Steelport, and so many guns and skins you might think you are playing CS:GO, oh yes, so many skins! Final verdict? 9/10. A great game filled with maximum madness and original jokes. Nice plot and well-made city to play in.. saints row iv is a great games i like super power style and saints row is coop that was fantastic thing actually. really fun, whimsical game. the series has only gotten better after they stopped trying to copy GTA and just decided to make a fun game. to a lot of people the fun part of GTA is just wreaking mayhem and being powerful, and that's what this game sets out to do.. One of the biggest delusion of my video game career. After loving ""Saints Row : The Third"" I hoped to see another great and humorous gem but instead I had to see a bad copy of ""prototype-style"" games. Bad shooting (even useless sometimes), boring plot, less humorous than the previous one and technically inferior.. It feels a lot like a massive DLC update for Saints Row III. You scramble to unlock various superpower through relatively repetitive side-missions in the same city as the prior game(with minor changes). The largest appealing factor is the main story-line. While ridiculously easy even on the hardest difficulty. the writing makes up for the lack of challenging gameplay. Vehicles and weapons feel largely ineffectual for the majority of the game which really sinks one of the main attractions of its predecessor.. I think this game is very amazing. I am very liked it . This game is very funny. I didn't bored not even one minute. The graphics are **** controls and scenario is amazing.. Ever since GTA IV took that series into a more gritty realistic style story the Saints Row series has been there to anchor the over the top side of the spectrum and it has done a great job of it. Saints Row IV finds you kidnapped by aliens and trapped inside of a simulation needing to free your crew and take on the aliens. While inside the simulation you get access to superpowers and basically become Neo. The humour is fantastic and the game does a great job of referencing various movies such as The Matrix and They Live. There are also various scenes that just have a damn near perfect soundtrack choice to take the fun up a notch. For instance I had never had a dogfight in an alien craft before set to “What Is Love” but I have now and it was highly enjoyable. They also do a great job of referencing the various characters and stories of the previous Saints Row games. There is a crazy amount of customization you can do to your character’s body and clothes and to weapons and to vehicles. There are lots of activities you can do as optional side quests but I found I didn’t enjoy many of them. They weren’t bad, I enjoyed ones where you inject viruses or assassinate rogue programs but didn’t enjoy some of the ones that were a timed mission. They also highlighted the lack of side quests for crew members. All of the missions for crew members, aside from a loyalty mission, was just them getting you to do sets of three of the various activities. The game also did a good job poking fun at Mass Effect’s romance options and the suicide mission sequence from Mass Effect 2. The one thing the game lacked was custom music. In GTA IV I could point the game to my music folder and have a custom music station to listen to and Saints Row IV didn’t have that. It did allow me to create a custom mix tape from all of the stations but I still would have preferred my own music. The game had decent graphical detail across the board. At no point was I blown away but at no point was I disappointed. Even for a game from 2013 I can list games that are the same age or older that have better detail but can also list many that have worse. The voice acting was very well done for all involved. I actually ended up preferring the human weapons as I found the alien weapons to feel weak, maybe it was more of an issue of their sound then how much damage they do. They also could overheat where the human weapons couldn’t. I played Saints Row IV on Linux. It was a decent port but not without issues. There were minor glitches I observed. My characters coat went through the floor of the car; a few times there would be no lip movement when a character spoke; and the AI movement was bad at times with them getting stuck around cars and obstacles. During play I had one time where the game froze and one time where the game crashed. The performance of the game was very spotty. I have put off playing Saints Row IV over the years as I like to play games maxed out and throughout the years as I upgraded from a R9 270; to a R9 380; to an RX480; to an RX 580 and finally to my 5700 XT I have always had frame rate issues. During that time I have also upgraded my CPU from a FX-8350 to an FX-9590 and finally to my Ryzen 5 2600X. The game spends a lot of the time above 60 FPS but can drop for no reason randomly to as low as 13 FPS and go as high as 130 FPS. There are seven different AA settings; five different AF settings; three different AO settings; and five other graphics options. You can change the difficulty level at any time. You can also save at any time but if you’re on a multi part mission it won’t save the progress and you’ll start from the beginning of that mission. There are 22 save slots you can use. The game also auto saves after missions and other events. Alt-Tab works. VRAM Usage: 1315-1808 MB CPU Usage: 12-28 % RAM Usage: 2.8-3.6 GB Frame Rate: 13-130 FPS Graphics Settings Used: 8x MSAA; 16x AF; all settings at high; 1920*1080 Disk Space Used: 10.11 GB Input Used: Keyboard + Mouse Overall I had a lot of fun with Saints Row IV which is no surprise as I also had a lot of fun with Saints Row the Third. No other open world series is as goofy or over the top and it never fails to put a smile on my face. If you enjoyed any other Saints Row games I encourage you to try this one. It has some issues but they didn’t impede me from having a good time. I finished the game in 26 hours and 24 minutes on normal difficulty. This was enough time to beat the main story; do all crew quests and loyalty missions; and complete 87% of the game overall. I got the game for free with a graphics card upgrade years ago but it is easily worth the $16.99 CAD it currently retails for and I would pay as much as $30 for it. My System: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 5700 XT Gaming X 8GB | Mesa 20.0.7 | Samsung 970 Evo Plus 500GB | Manjaro 20.0.3 | Mate 1.24 | Kernel 5.7.0-3-MANJARO. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Saints Row IV doesn't take itself too seriously. When alien computer simulations, super powers and pixelator guns populate every minute of this game, all you can do is enjoy the absurd joy ride while it lasts.. A decent time waster with solid character customisation. Ultimately couldn't hold attention for long due to middling combat and overall open world experience.. Thanks to game insanity this is a very unique title :) A very enjoyable story and ridiculous mechanics :). The best Saints Row game with no doupts. Many crybabies say it's inferior to SR 1 & 2, but it is way better. It's our dreamed open world game and it's 10 times better than any GTA. They give you hundreds of possibilities to costumize your character and the missions are truly fin to play. The best Saints Row experience in to now. They ed the game up but there are good missions and flashback from older saints row games. Still don't buy this crap not even on %50 sale just watch on youtube to see how shieet this game is just play saints row 2&3 If you haven't already. *I finished the game and I felt sincere pity to people who endured the same game as me. If you looking for realistic open world games, go for GTA Series If you looking for Superpower open world games this game may suite you yes, this game is different from previous titles, and I like it Overall 10/10 Mestaapiece. I love this game. Saints Row IV is probably my favourite game from every game I played (I played over 200 games and one of them are GTA V, PAYDAY 2, Call of Duty Black Ops etc.) the story is fun and enjoyable. Many enjoyable jokes, conversations, weapons, missions and characters. The only thing I don't like is the graphics and some bugs that are to this day are not fixed. I highly recommend this game!. This is more like a big expansion to SR 3, than an actual stand-alone game. Still, I loved it. The humour was great, sprinting was sick, story cool. Pickens approves!. Despite being fun and having the same charm as its predecessor, Saints Row IV is simply a fun but forgettable experience that relies too heavily on Saints Row The Third's assets and feels more like a mod/decent expansion than a brand new game. Still a fun game overall just lacking in originality.. This game is supposed to be a DLC of saints row 3. I don't know what happened but this game gave me hours of fun. For those guys who haven't played the previous titles and want to have fun, get this it will not disappoint you.. -fun -easy -good voice acting -character graphics poor -story? It has a story? -played perfectly for the first chapter. Now randomly loses mouse input. Often. Frequently. And getting worse. -no longer playable -8 without the freezes...0 with them. (Single player only review) Story: 4 Gameplay: 7 Characters: 6 World: 7 Music: Graphics: 8 Optimization: 8 Value: Not worth the original price ($60) Art direction: 6 Enjoyment: 7 Overall: 6. Volition and Deep Silver took a really curvy turn that made the Saints Row series not serious and a clusterf*ck. Only good thing about this game is the graphics, the combat and the humor, which is always great in Saints Row and the fact that it is still playable to some.. I remember I was so hyped for this game, and then... meh. Look, SR4 is a really fun and playable game on its own right. With the humor, the hyperbolic action and violence, it surely provides you the entertainment that it's known for. But isn't it our right to expect something a little bit different? Isn't just laying emphasis on the stuff that made SRIII so great and improving almost nothing a weak move? Like I said, SR4 is a solid game. But it'snot an improvement over the previous one except a few one-liners. And that's just disappointing.. If there is one thing about Saints Row IV that has me keep on playing it, it's the amount of fun and chaotic things you can do in it. SR IV is FAR different than what the first three were, and although it will turn away some of the fans, there is no doubt that the fun factor is still through the roof. I highly recommend you get this game on PC because of Steam Workshop. Seriously, the amount of content the workshop has in this game is great. But the console versions are also an A+ in my book. It has some drawbacks. Game is too easy to complete and the addition of super powers, while fun, does not help at all. Even on the hardest difficulty I was able to breeze through the game with no problem. It's also occasionally buggy so be on the lookout for that. Besides that, I do recommend this game. And although I still prefer SR 2 as my favorite, SR IV is right behind it for being the best game in the series. Definitely worth playing it when you get the chance.. Saints Row 4 is probably the craziest and most over the top open world game ever published. Logics and realism doesn't exist in this game but this is what makes it so great: Its a vacation from GTA to a crazy world where almost everything is possible. The game is very fun and offers a lot of content.. To be perfectly honest this was not a game I was expecting. All I knew before lunching it was that it's not your average GTA-like game. But in the end I must admit I enjoyed it quite a bit. In short this game feels like GTA on mods with a pretty stupid, absurd story line and weird game play. In the game you control the president of united states. But this guy was previously a gang member with his homies being the staff members. Planet earth gets attacked and destroyed by aliens, people get kidnapped and put into a matrix like pods aboard the alien spaceship and you get put into a computer simulation where you try to defeat the bad alien boss. This gives the ground to you having all of the absurd powers. Gameplay actually like GTA on mods. You can jump high, stomp, fly around, throw cars and other heavy objects, run like flash and shoot fire bullets. The game is not very unified and feels like a collection of mini games where you get to use your powers one way or another. There are events where you have to scale towers, other places you will race with your super speed. In other instanced you'll do some hacking, throw cars through virtual hoops and so on. On their own the modes are pretty fun to play and there is really a lot of them. If you're not looking for anything serious and just want to enjoy yourself with no thought involved - this might be the right fit. The main story missions make a bit more sense but not that much - just feel like a different mode from the rest. The progression and upgrade system does not feel very rewarding - though you are able to update your powers to make them more effective. Guns are strange and most of them are pretty useless. You can drive around in cars but since you're faster on foot it doesn't make any sense to do so aside from the special missions. The game graphics are pretty decent although constant night time feels boring after a while. In the end it was fun playing. A rather light game but fun nonetheless - surprisingly so to be honest.. I don't understand why people complained about these games getting unrealistic, they got more fun that way. This game is so fun, and SUPER POWERS!!!!! OHHHHH MA GAAWWWWWDDD, this game is just so fun and entertaining.. Yes. So this is Saints Row the Third, just with a new story. No new content whatsoever - same map, same cars, same clothes. Maybe a couple new weapons. However, i loved Saints Row 3, and i really enjoyed Saints Row 4 for the same reasons i enjoyed its predecessor - humor, lightness, action-packed (although those racing and jumping missions are a major pain in the butt - annoying!) gameplay, hilarious character, and a parody of a story. So if you liked SR3 and want to play more of it - SR4 is for you. Just don't expect anything new. Seriously.. I played Saints Row: Mass Erect back when it first came out, on PS3, and happily purchased the PC version later at a discount. It's the culmination of years of over-the-top action, crude humor, and the--is-a-writer plot twists. There are a lot of people who say this game went overboard, that Saints Row: The Third was better. While the latter camp may have a point, the former doesn't know what the they're talking about. This is Saints Row, es. There IS no overboard. We crossed the line so many times that it's smudged to hell and back. Saints Row IV takes everything you loved about the series up to this point and injects it with an alien invasion, presidential hijinx, superpowers, combat mechs, hover tanks, bizzarre weapons (including the almighty dubstep gun) a metric of Matrix, Mass Effect and They Live references, brings back almost every character ever seen in the series, throws a couple new ones in the form of a sexy English operative and a snarky robot orb, and generally just blows what you thought you knew about sandbox crime sims out your . Everything Grand Theft Auto V got wrong was done right in this game months earlier. The combat is relentless, ridiculous and always entertaining, and all the side content is worked into the ordinary game flow, especially if you're shooting for the best ending. I like to think each Saints Row is the previous one on a whole lot of drugs. If that is true, then hide Saints Row IV from the DEA before you give zombie Ronald Reagan a heart attack. I loved this game so much that it netted me my first and only Platinum Trophy. Take a trip back to the Row and take a whiff of that purple haze once again, you won't regret it.. Really boring. Superpowers are cool, but didn't add more depth and lessen the complexity of the game. Just like what others had said, it copied Saints Row 3, added Superpowers, changed the plot with an alien invasion which doesn't interest me. I finished the game just doing the main and loyalty missions. After the ending, I quit right away.. Good God, is this game insane. Superpowers, dubstep guns, aliens, People with skin made out of solid gold. Pros +The Humour is great +Ditto for story +Very Fun Gameplay +All characters are likeable and funny Cons -Very similar to Saints Row 3, with the city being the same, and mechanics and characters are very similar -With the exception of the tank, all vehicles are practically useless. You don't need cars, Just run around the place. For Only $15 on steam, this is a great open world game to pick up and play, for 20 mins to 2 hours. I Recommend it.. This game is very good open world game . Not really good graphics and physics for open world game 2013, but very amazing storyline . One of the best storyline of 2013, but storyline in Grand Theft Auto 5 is better than storyline in Saints Row . Saint's Row 4 is open world game with heroes . The beginning in this game is very amazing and interesting and this is the best game in Saints Row Series, but all SR Series very amazing .. At its best, Saints Row IV is a love letter to the franchise. At its worst, the game is just a copy and paste of Saints Row The Third with aliens and superpowers. Superpowers! Blast, Telekinesis, Stomp (each with varying elements like Freeze","the best Saints Row game, the story, humor, music, and gameplay is on point . it takes the craziness of Saints Row 3 to levels that just aren't enjoyable anymore . the story is weaker than 3 but still enjoyable ."
892.Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction,"""Grand Theft Auto"" in North Korea. Or something like that. This is a fantastic, military-based action game that blends an open-world with lots of big explosions. It's like a Michael Bay movie crossed with Rockstar's GTA formula. You take down baddies for money and can use the cash on bigger guns for your next target. Gameplay can get repetitive, but if you want to bomb the crap out of stuff, this is the perfect game for you. I would rate it with an 8.6 out of 10.. Best game ever. Other than the dates driving and lack of fast travel, it remains a masterpiece. I truly hope there will be a remake or another sequel soon.. Excellent **** game. I can't believe how bad ass this is. F.... gamepro for giving it an 80. They've always **** ass.. The game may be filled with glitches and a few bugs that you simply cannot overlook, but to me, this defines open-world destruction. It is very similar to the GTA series, except it takes out all the unwarranted drug and sexual references, and just replaces it with war in South Korea. The amount of vehicles lacks in comparison to its sequel (which is not as good gameplay wise) but the fact you can man anti-air and artillery units is amazing. The deck-of-cards system is pretty cool, with each suit representing a type of target and the higher the face value, the more important (and guarded) the target is to the North Koreans (NK). There are NK bunkers EVERYWHERE, so you can always pick a fight with them to test out a new gun or to just run them over. Tanks are pretty fun to drive, and blowing up an entire town couldn't be much more fun. The missions/contracts you accept range in difficulty and type, so there is a good variety there. If you read my review of the sequel, Mercenaries 2, you will see what makes this game an overall better fit between storyline and just doing whatever you want. The cheat codes are amazing, since this game was developed in part by Lucas Arts, you can get a Han Solo or Indiana Jones costume :)","""Grand Theft Auto"" is a military-based action game that blends an open-world with lots of explosions . the deck-of-cards system is pretty cool, with each suit representing a type of target . you take down baddies and can use the cash on bigger guns for your next target ."
894.Test Drive V-Rally,"AKA V Rally 2, this off road racer is even better than the sequel to Sega Rally with far more cars, tracks and challenges. Like the version of Soulcalibur, it showcased how superior to the PlayStation One the Dreamcast really was.. This was the first racing game i played or one of the first and i loved it! It was one of the only rally games i liked and it was replayable. YOU COULD MAKE YOUR OWN TRACKS! I LOVE DOING THAT! The cars were cool and you could unlock better ones. Not just boring new ones that **** compared to teh standared cars. It also have the first easter egg i found,or glitch i dont know. I was crashing against the side of the road and i found a road that went across the track so i lapped everyone. The track didnt match any of the of track though. Fun game!",this off road racer is even better than the sequel to Sega Rally . it showcased how superior to the PlayStation One the Dreamcast really was . the cars were cool and you could unlock better ones .
895.Total Annihilation,"Look at that, I’m writing a review 25 years after the game was released and I give it a 10. This is a fantastic RTS game with dozens of units and buildings that you’ll most likely all use during the 50 single player campaign (both sides) in addition to a DLC called Core Contingency. I played the game when it came out in 97 but I was so **** by C&C at the time that I refused to invest time in another rts and I left it at that. 2 decades and a half later I can tell you that this game is much much deeper than C&C and has a lot more strategy. The battles, especially in later stages, are epic and can last several hours where you will have to take hill after hill and the AI in hardest difficulty is ruthless and will build units non stop by the hundreds unless you crash it to the last unit. I highly recommend this game, even 25 years later.. TA was, and continues to be the most innovative RTS until recently. Physics, terrain, weather, theatres of war, and map intel all contribute to TA's virbrant gameplay. Intuitive interface, unit AI, and order queue makes your massive army a breeze to command. The. Legendary RTS. Way ahead of competition. Technically incomparably better than Red Alert or StarCraft.. This game was the best! Really advanced for the time: real 3D, 3d units with 3d map, and you could really feel that during the gameplay! It adapts to any monitor resolution. 1996 version have no problem scaling up to 2020 monitors! Many older games still fails at that. The AI was stunning and you could have full control of anything on the map. No units limit, modding, huge maps, streaming resources. We still need a new modern remake of that game. Supreme Commander was good but the engine wasn't that well programmed.... Best strategy game ever made! Detailed modeling of the shots, lot of viable tactic, customizable, runs great on any computer.. 10/10 Best RTS ever made. Great soundtrack, graphics look alright 20 years later, tons of mods, and 1080p support. Better than overrated starcraft. This game is really old now. I played it a lot back when it was new, and have come back to it a couple of times since. The thing that stands out is the amount of polish. Everything just works. You want to give a building craft a huge patrol that covers the map to pick up scrap metal, no problem, you want to assign some fighter escorts, do it. The game never gets in the way of itself which makes it really easy to get lost in.. The best strategy of all times. Father of all good RTS. The predecessor of Supreme Commander and Planetary Annihilation. A ""must play"" for every gamer!. TA... epic game, you can say that it is an old game, but while playing it you will feel a real and intensive war and you will be so addicted, from the best RTS games ever released !!! really the producer of that game is a genius, this is the only thing i can say... Now an other version of it is released: TA escalation better balance more units up to 4th technologies but same game.. So i think this came before Starcraft and after Dark Reign (both epitomes of the RTS genre) and brought quite some innovative ideas to the table (like recycling your own robots for scrap resources and actual 3D models). They were not revolutionary per se, but the game made everything work together to afford an unforgetable experience. Really played this games to the holes! :)). probably the best RTS game - until supreme commander came. especially when you compare it to newer games the AI and poor map construction completely let down the entire concept of the game. also, if you're going to actually play it you need to ramp up the speed to avoid 10 hour skirmishes.. Its my favourite RTS ever. Innovative, with great music, campaign, lot of units, tactics, mods and everything. ""I am imba"" commander and climate of the game that is so addictive. Graphics after 17 years (!) are still good, thats really hard to believe how they did it. You MUST play this game!. The grandfather of RTS, the benchmark for everything that has and will follow in the genre, a masterpiece. Few can argue that even with the nostalgia goggles taken off that this is one of the finest games ever to steal money from our wallets. But enough with the compliments, lets explain why this game was superb from the ground up. Resource gathering, rather than the generic ""pool"" you are required to upkeep your 'economy' or 'eco' for short in metal and energy. This dynamic system which is drained and restored at the same time will allow you to build and queue many units as their cost is deducted from your stockpile over the course of their build time, if you run out the build time slows and if not it leaves you free to construct all the more units. Monitoring this economy is key to success and the glorious thing about it is that attacking your enemies metal extractors/generators can directly harm their ability to inflict pain on you. The trick is to maintain that eco while ensuring your opponent cannot do the same, real time STRATEGY. Unfortunately for you if you do not use this advantage to wipe your enemy out there is a strong chance that the wreckage left from the battle by destroyed buildings/units can also be extracted for resources, you are thus feeding the enemy which again is another thing to think about. The combat itself is fantastic and is supplemented by an amazing score by Jeremy Soule, the guy behind the OST of skyrim/oblivion. Vehicles explode leaving wreckage and flying debris going everywhere, (debris that can actually DAMAGE nearby units!), endgame final tier units and artillery cannons that can fire across the map, nukes... anti nukes? I can leave the imagination to picture that while trying to keep all your buildings switched on (yes, running out of power means a lot of buildings will not work). The music also changes from track to track depending on your situation in game, during the build phase you get some eerie foreboding music, when a fight starts the orchestral stuff kicks in and when the battle is done with unit wreckage strewn across the map you get a nice slow spooky song to go with your build units collecting resources from the dead. You can also switch that off and play what you want when you want it, put the game disc in a CD player to just play the music, boot the game and replace the CD with a DIFFERENT music CD and play that music? It has two campaigns for both factions, the Arm and the Core. Lots of mods are available to add new units and even lift the unit cap from 200 to whatever you feel like. The beautiful thing is that it is still actively played today and many servers are available to duke it out online. This came out back in 1997, you could probably pick it up for peanuts or find it online to download. While I do not feel my words do it justice it is definitely worth taking the time to play it, especially if you enjoyed SupCom.. This was a fantastic game in it's day. I grew up with this and still regard it as a fantastic game even after the many games I've played thereafter. It set the bar for future games. Even silly things like 100 stacked construction planes made the game awesome. Almost as awesome as being the guy who blows them all up with an AE shot. Played this on a 200mhz and it's in my heart and soul forever.. Ahead of its time, and utilizing a unique resource model that monitored rate of resource gathering as well as total reserves, allowing for deficit spending of previously gathered surplus. However as officially released it did suffer from key flaws that reduce its score. The developer clearly had a bias in favor of the ARM faction, as there are many CORE units in critical roles that are clearly inferior whereas the few units that CORE has an advantage over the ARM are in less vital roles. There are also a lot of redundant or useless units that sound nice in theory but are obsoleted in competitive play by far more cost efficient units or units that require less micro-management.. Oh my goodness. It's been more than thirteen years since I last played this game. When I found out they were making Supreme Commander essentially a modern reboot of Total Annihilation I may or may not have had to change my shorts... anyway, I am a big RTS gamer and I loved TA because of the shift of emphasis from a balance of resource gathering, unit building, and fighting to more towards unit building and fighting. While I appreciate the resource gathering element of RTS games, because yes it does add another layer of complexity, I just want to get to the action. Give me my units and give me the terrain and I will deploy them how I see fit to best win. Did I mention I don't really like waiting around too long? There is of course still a resource element in that you need to manage mass and energy, but those are pretty much infinite/self-produced and that was another awesome thing about it. The best part of the game for me? The ability to speed up your production/building process by having multiple drones or your commander help out.. Amazing, there are no other words to describe this game and its expansions. If you are an rts gamer through and through and have not played this game then you then you are missing out big time. I have played all the old rts games and a lot of the new ones and none of them compare to this. This is how i rate the game Music/Sound 10/10 unit diversity 10/10 graphics for the time 10/10 originality 10/10 game play 10/10. This game has next to no flaws and i rate it the best rts ever.. Nothing quite like it, before or since. Massive RTS with huge replayability value; add to that the sheer amount of customisation that can be done (the mods, the extra units, maps, etc which are all easily downloadable) and you've got a game of legend.. This game is a multiplayer action game. D-gun enemies into flying shards of burning metal, and construct that vehicle factory while surfacing from water to deploy fast Flash light tanks to immediately attack your enemy while bombers and fighters are battling for supremacy on the sky. This game is truly epic and deep. Playability 10. AI not so good but campaigns are well built. You can build your own AI though. Over the internet 10 players can play simultaneously with a total of 10000 units on the field. Massive long range artillery will shell the battlefield while nukes blast away at wreckage over which high energy lasers are targeting enemy mechas and battle-vehicles.. I had to pop over here and give this old title it's well deserved 10. I can't even believe how good this game still is when it's almost 15 years old. If there's an RTS you want to play with great units, balance and economy then this is it. There's even been a new engine (spring RTS) built with this game in mind, and you can download it for free! I don't know what else I can say other than I'm a fan of a lot of RTS games but this is the king of them all.. time and time again I compare more recent RTS games to this, and it is still far more enjoyable than almost all. the graphics are dated, the storyline is borderline non-existent, and the AI players are fairly terrible. but it (still) has some of the best unit AI (queue up orders and customise stances), true 3 dimensional GAMEPLAY (no shooting through hills, artillery and ballistic trajectories matter-something that is SEVERELY LACKING in even current RTS) and what was a very active mod community. hundreds of units to a side (as opposed to maybe 10 or 15 in star/war-craft, many, many different units, unit types, weapons even in the un-modded game, and it is a wonderful LAN game, especially with (now) older computers.. Sweet mother of god, this game is marvelous. Yes, it is a bit aged in the graphic department, but it makes it up a hundred times by the gameplay. I only picked it up recently, but I didn't have so much fun since the classic rts games from westwood of old. Add to that really nice pathfinding and unit behavior, bullets and missiles being actual physical obiects with calculated trajectories, great music, atmosphere and two buckets of awesome, and you get this game.. I'm surprised so little is said about this game, the amount of mods that were available and the amount of fun I had playing this game is crazy. Even 13 years after its release, and I haven't had as much fun with any other RTS, not even SC2! TA is great by itself, but when mods are added, the gameplay changes so much, so many more units are made it's insane. Even the graphics are good, explosions are awesome, they feel so much more intense then in all other strategy games. This is easily one of the best games of all time.. This game opened my eyes to the fun of creating sandbox style RTS with tons of units. This is responsible for many days of sleep deprivation, others mad that the phone line is tied up (dial-up), and excessive amount of money for fast PC to run it smoother. After some patches and new unit releases and ultimately when the Core Contingency expansion was released, all those issues in the past just became even more severe. That and hygiene and diet suffered--the house was being neglected and junk food became the primary choice of sustenance. No other game has done this to me. EverQuest comes close though. This led me to follow Chris Taylor to his other games, though SupCom FA is the only thing that has come close to recreating the experience of Total Annihilation. Got to love the old MPlayer crowd. TEN was cool for rankings, though I didn't do as well as I thought I should've (1900s). Heat was nice for casual games, but ELITE clan battles were pretty intense. Only remember Lazeroo and (can only think of a bear for some reason). I was always coming up with crafty stuff like Rapier rush comm snipes and was accused of cheating on more than one occasion. The truly good players focused on tactical micro such as early bombing runs on low resource maps like Coast to Coast. I always did well with macro, spamming the heck out of Hawks, Vamps, nukes, artillery, etc on a such a large scale... Ahh, memories.","TA was, and continues to be, the most innovative rts until recently . it was, and continues to be the most innovative rts until recently . it adapts to any monitor resolution . 1996 version have no problem scaling up to 2020 monitors ."
897.Golden Sun: The Lost Age,"A true masterpiece with a massive amount of content for a GBA game. It masterfully connects to its predecessor and develops it further.. + Puzzles are more creative/ abundant+ Builds on the original story+ Bosses & New Summons stand out+ Makes for a great Sequel~ Doesn't stand on it's own~ A lot of callbacks to the original Golden Sun~ Data transfer actually mattered~ New summons have to be earned~ More bonus dungeons- A lot of backtracking- World is considerably empty despite how big it is- Generic enemy design is horrible, with a lot of reused sprites and recolors- First BIG dungeon is horribly designed / easy to get lost in- Too many big dungeons / not a lot of pay off for exploring- Little direction on what you should actually be doing midway through the game. Golden Sun + Golden Sun: The Lost Age are probably my favorite games of all-time, and I love a 'lot' of games... This 2nd game builds upon the 1st & has even more content + extra superbosses. It's longer though & not as succinct. I actually prefer it to the 1st game because it is so fleshed out & expansive. There is so much content packed in this journey throughout the 2-game joint story. There's a lot of dialogue with an interesting story. It's not Final Fantasy or maybe Dragon Quest length, but not short either if you do a lot of optional things. The battles are quick-paced with little-to-no wasted time at the beginning or ends of them which is nice compared to some other RPGs, and also has some definite strategy involved for optional super bosses. The weapons, equipment, unleashes, psynergy, summons, Djinn, puzzles are all quite cool aspects of the game. The great puzzles & psynergy used outside of battles are fun & varied too! The sprites & visuals are phenomenal for the Game Boy Advance, a standout game for the graphical capabilities of the system. Also, the OST is a particular highlight; the person who made the music put their soul into the game, developing the different tracks. All the tracks are very nostalgic for me & quite good, like Final Fantasy IX's OST. Check out Coaltergeist's YouTube channel for remastered Golden Sun tracks if you want a taste. This game is definitely up there with some of the bests from the GBA system for sure(if not besting them all in my humble opinion)... great games such as: Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Advance, Mario & Luigi: Super Star Saga, Advance Wars, Metroid, Castlevania, Final Fantasy, and Fire Emblem. If you like JRPGs, lots of extra content, & want to play one of the absolute best to grace the GBA, definitely check out both Golden Sun & Golden Sun: The Lost Age. Thanks for reading, and have a great day!. + Gorgeous art style and graphics for the GBA + Enthralling combat system + Epic and evocative soundtrack + Memorable world, story and villains + Puzzle-laden dungeon design. The best JRPG I have ever played. I just love the world of Weyard and its characters, the fact that it is a flat world, the fact that the game is based on our real world in term of geography and you can find references to various places and cultures. The second game improves on everything the first game did right, a bigger world, with more places, a ship to navigate all that, puzzles are more complex, combat is deeper and more challenging and the story has many unpredictable twists. The best game i have ever seen to the gba, This is a must have for every rpg fan, who owns a Game Boy. Bautiful game. Engaging sequel to an enjoyable RPG, The Lost Age improves on the original in pretty much every way. Not a huge leap forward but a treat for fans of the original.. Still UNDERRATED! Probably Golden Sun 1 (and 2) are the best RPG ever made in my opinion, and I played much. Lovely story, thrilling, and interesting graphics for GBA, the best Soundtrack I ever heard in a game (you should check orchestral remakes on youtube), atmospheric, great controls and. Well, the best game I ever played and I played probably a thousand games, well it's very subjective and I also could find things I could cry about if I would but the story and the game altogether are just satisfying.. The amazing second part of one of the best games I’ve played in my life and it continiues with greatness exactly where the first part ended. The new story, the (new) characters, the (new) skills, the (new) game mechanics, turn based battles, the mystery, finding out more secrets and hidden functions/contents by yourself, the amazing soundtrack that creates the great unique atmosphere like the first part, etc. For me the combination of all these aspects was so good that it made me searching for a similar combo or similar games all the time. This game is the perfect second part, it is so good and I love it so much as well.. As good as the previous game, though puzzles and combat are better. However, the final third was a little rushed. If both games were combined in one and allowed unrestricted access to the entire continent, this would’ve been a 10/10 game. Hopefully a future remake will do just that, but don’t get your hopes up.. Golden Sun, but even better. Takes all the good parts of the first, while adding new, welcome features like the forging, and the boat.. Perfect in all sense. There's not comparison with this piece of art. I still can't believe why the first part has more votes than this one.. ok, here's my first negetive review. I don't like the game too much because of the game design. It barley tells you what to do or where to go. I felt like they didn't really have a good tortorial. I bought the game wanting to try a new IP and I liked the combat but I just felt like if I'm not getting anywhere and that I have to look up a walkthrough every 5 minutes, the game isn't for me. I understand if other people liked it especially if they played final fantasy alot but for me, more pokemon please. It honestly represented everything I hated about gaming as a kid. Hard, little directions, and frustrations.. Golden sun 1 and Golden Sun TLA are hands down not only my favorite GBA games of all time, but also one of my favorite stories as well (which was unfortunately ruined by GS3 Dark Dawn)... I love the graphics, I love the RPG way of battles, solving puzzles, the tension of the story, the plot, the four elements, djinnis, summons, rare items, extremely likable main characters, antagonists, final bosses and most of all - the MUSIC!. Golden Sun: The Lost Age is a frustratingly dissonant experience. Almost every mechanic is flawed.. All the same, years later, I still throw the soundtrack on to hear its unexpectedly epic sounding pan-flute synth rock and roll mixed with low, droning, tones. The oppressive KU-KRASHHH of the magical glowing blade of the Ragnarok spell smashing your enemies in an explosion of earth-element particles followed by the sharp CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! as each monster contorts in damage is objectively the best sounding and best looking thing to ever appear on a Gameboy. It may actually carry the whole game - It's hard to find anything else deserving of the critical acclaim Lost Age boasts. Story/Characters: 2/5 The story is... well. You are Felix and pals, on a quest to light two lightouses and awaken an ancient magic, without which the world will end. Officially, the cast from the first game are trying to stop you, but they do nothing show it. Amazingly, outside of a few contrived squabbles between these characters, the game goes without a primary antagonist. Except for a few tidbits of backstory that come up in dialogue once in a while, the protagonists are devoid of character. 90% of the dialogue delivered could come from any character - they are interchangeable. You may wonder how the game handles a final boss without a villain. One literally falls out of the sky. Combat: 4/5 Character powers focus around elemental spirits called djinn that can be assigned to any character. There is an incredible amount of depth to the system - mixing and matching elemental djinn can lead you to thousands of class combinations across your four characters. In short, combine lots of elements in one character to create a tanky physical fighter who can wreak havoc with a sword. Concentrate a single element to create spellcasters. Or find yourself anywhere in the middle of the spectrum for more flexible characters. It's a neat system! Unfortunately, the dichotomy I just described is not explained anywhere in the game. Without a proper guide, you'll likely make your characters weaker any time you deviate from giving your earth-character all the earth-djinn. The single most inexcusable aspect of the battle system is that a handful of spells actually do damage calculated from your attack stat rather than your elemental power stat. Imagine the physical/special split in Pokemon attacks - just entirely undocumented. Dungeons/Exploration: 2/5 The world is entirely open. Except, you cannot just explore wherever and expect to accomplish anything. Each dungeon revolves around puzzles solved with a utility spell gained in a previous dungeon. So, no, really, it's NOT open world. The path of dungeons you must solve is linear, but you the game won't tell you the correct path. Imagine Zelda if you could enter any dungeon at any time, but you get to explore the first few floors fighting past random encounters until you find out that you actually need the hookshot or boomerang to progress any further. Except, this is not Zelda. This is Golden Sun. The cues for when a puzzle requires psyenergy are not quite so obvious. Without a guide, all you can do is squint at a funny looking object, wonder if it's something you're supposed to do magic at, and then spend five minutes unloading every spell you've learned so far on it hoping that one of them is the key. Or hey, maybe it's not actually a lock. It's just a funny looking statue. Better go back into the overworld and find another dungeon to attempt. Did I mention there are 21 of these utility spells? And nearly every one is attached to an item that must clog up your limited inventory space for the rest of the game? Not to worry, the spells that aren't attached to items are made available with the djinn system... meaning you'll have to muck up your carefully tuned djinn-class system in order to get to them. Overall: For the time and the platform, this is a decent rpg. When you're in the right dungeon with the right spells with the right class setup, it's a great game. Just up until you leave that dungeon and have to drag your pack of teenaged, no-personality protagonists back into the overworld and click through a drawn out conversation with somebody who's not even a villain.. The graphic, story and world building aspect of this RPG was ahead of its time on a mobile system.. Golden Sun: The Lost Age continues to not only leave where Golden Sun left off plot-wise, but also the sheer brilliance and scope of its mechanics and combat while further adding more and making the experience just as enjoyable. It definitely captures the feeling of adventure despite its limitations on being a handheld gaming device. The only issues that would crop up is similar to the first game: color-swap palette enemies, overuse of dialogue and such. Despite the issues the second part to the epic that is Golden Sun makes an all around great experience that makes slightly better than the original and the one the best handheld games of all time.. Surprisingly underrated, The Lost Age is a brilliant sequel to the original game. The graphics are possibly the best on the system, the soundtrack is epic and the gameplay is a solid combination of exploration, puzzles and battles. The score is a 9.7, rounded up to 10.. This game was great, and that's just plain fact. Great story, great villain, great characters, great music, great gameplay. I really can't find anything to complain about with this game. I highly recommend playing it if you haven't already.. a masterpiece just like golden sun 1, offering a bigger world, more exploration, more playable characters, a crafting system and so much more. this game was/is and will be one of the best games ever. Fairly inferior than the original (THE best rpg on GBA) I felt lost on my objectives and the story seemed too loose. Also, it didn't show noticeable improvement over the first game.. This game was freakin awesome.. The best game you will ever play(very possibly in your life). Great story, great animations(for the gba), great characters, great music, great replay value, and great NOSTALGIA!!!. A surprisingly underrated yet deep JRPG that can give popular development studios like Square Enix and Atlus a run for their money. The strong story, visuals, music, and controls all come together to offer a truly unique gameplay experience. Hell, I would go as far as to say that Golden Sun: The Lost Age, sequel to Golden Sun, is the best role-playing game on a handheld to date.. I am the kind of gamer who enjoys almost exclusively casual games. Anything Mario, anything that you can just pick up and play for 30 minutes without getting **** into a story or involved strategy decisions. But I LOVE this game, as well as its predecessor. I don't know what it is about it, but I will play this game for hours and hours and do the kind of things that I usually hate in video games. It is so so good.","Golden Sun + Golden Sun: The Lost Age are probably my favorite games of all-time, and i love a 'lot' of games . the sprites & visuals are phenomenal for the graphical capabilities of the system ."
898.Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate,"I have nothing but positive memories of this game. I still remember my mother coming back from the video game shop after I'd pestered her to buy me the game (my sister already had it and I was desperate to play it with her). The game is dazzling, magnificent, magical, brilliant... I don't know enough words to describe it. It's one of the best game I've ever played on the 3DS.. Arguably the best third party game on the 3DS, this is a really great Monster Hunter game and the fact its on a portable console is incredible.. Simply one of the best experiences of the 3ds and video games in general. I really can't say enough about how much I've enjoyed this wonderful game in the 300 hours I've been playing it (300 hours because of the incredible amount of content it has, not because I'm hooked lmao). 10/10. Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate is a great introduction to beginners like myself, and after playing it for many hours i see why M.H fans rage about the game. It's open world action game that a player can level and customize its character in many ways it pleases, and fight big creatures that make the game addicting to play. Add to that the great introduction and cutscenes that look fantastic in 3D, Overall, for action and open world gamers this is a must play and for others a worthy try.. Still, the best Monster Hunter to date, a lot of content, the first mechanical change that felt like it made a true dent in the series, a broad roster of monsters, and an amount of craftables indescriptible. Though, but fair when you learn the game, an amazing experience for whoever loves monster hunter or a good challenge.. I can only think of one thing that will make this game better. Port it to PC. One of the best 3ds games in history. Awesome community, great gameplay, and the design of the monsters are amazing. The story is fine and every weapon feels different. Maps are well designed, monsters are fair, and reward smart gameplay. The story, however, is really nothing special.. I still go back to this game after years of playing plenty of other entries in the series. Monster Hunter fans would agree that this would be the turning point of the series, for better, as the new environments and monsters paved the way for entries to come. For a modest price, you get content that spans hundreds of hours through different villages, including G-Rank hunts which include some of the best monsters in the series to date. The story is fantastic, taking you on a journey through the land in a caravan hunting different monsters in lush landscapes. Fully-rendered cutscenes now flow right into gameplay, making the experience of encountering each monster for the first time feel much more intense, and it's something not replicated to such success in any entry since. The only issue, which seemed to irk many, was its inclusion of the Street Pass featured Guild Quests. These quests could only be leveled up through repeat clears, and its difficulty scaling would prove to be the hardest in the series to date. Other than this small hiccup, you easily have the best online 3DS multiplayer content.. Monster Hunter Generations was my introduction to the series, followed by Generations Ultimate, then Rise. Upon playing this game, it's by far the best old world monster hunter for me. The amount of cut scenes you get also adds up to the immersion which later titles abandoned (except World). This game may not specifically have a great story, but the game made me feel like I'm in this journey with the caravan. The build up of danger is great and the colorful characters in the caravan made me happy throughout the end. I have yet to finish G rank but I'm currently in Guild High Rank as of writing this. But all in all, experiencing this game is very memorable and I do hope people try it out!. I played this game a while back and it's definitely a 10/10. My first game of the MH series, and remains one of my favorites among them all, I've sunk 1400+ hours into this game (two separate save files, one with 900 other with 500) and if I went back to playing this I'd still have something to do.. MH4U is a game that takes you for a spin. You're never on command, you are the Monster's ****. Jokes aside, this game is awesome and while pretty easy to play it is also quite deep and some quests and classes require some thinking and strategizing. This is an excellent package and great value for its price. Action-packed fun and challenging game for the go. It's not a game for everyone though as it has some pretty boring collecting and small fry hunting quests. Not the best looking game on the system but definitely a must-buy for those looking for some action on their 3DS.. Best MH in the series, good strory plot, very fun and enjoyable gameplay and good sound tracks. Online part is very enjoyable but servers aren't good enough. What an amazing game. By far the best MH game of all hand held consoles (MHGU included). The gameplay is amazing. A ton of content to play and the multiplayer is outstanding. I prefer this on to the Generations and Generations Ultimate just because it's gameplay. It's so much better. The 3D effect is amazing and the frame rate is actually very good with almost non existing slow downs.. This is hands-down a magnificent master piece. I've played the demo when I was about 7 to 8 years old and looking back down, when I got it in 2018-2019, it has aged pretty well. It's interesting mechanics, tons of monsters to hunt, many weapons to craft, this game will never get boring, unless if you are a try hard and grind this game but that's besides the point. This is the game that got me into the Monster Hunter series, and is still a must-have today.. Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate is a game that is worth far more than what the price tag says about it. There is well over 300 hours worth of unique fun and progression to be had within this behemoth of a handheld game. Every single weapon feels awesome, powerful, and unique. The combat is intense, and is no button masher, because that will simply get you killed. Dodging monster’s attacks, and striking at the right time will lead to a victorious hunt every time. The progression system is perfectly simple: you hunt monsters, you get the loot from them, and you use that loot to craft stronger weapons and armor, which allows you to hunt stronger monsters, and the cycle repeats. This cycle is so rewarding and satisfying that it can easily draw anyone in who enjoys a rewarding experience. This game even contains a standalone story mode, where you investigate the cause of an unknown virus with your caravan as you travel to multiple locales, looking for an answer. This story isn’t just serviceable, its actually really fun and genuinely interesting to play through. The place where Monster Hunter hits another sweet spot is cooperative multiplayer. I have made so many friends through this feature, that 90% of the friends on my friends list is from this game. The thought of working together to hunt down a big beast for rich spoils is brilliant in concept, and its done flawlessly in execution. While there were occasional hitches that caused a disconnect, those were so rare that it doesn’t really hinder my experience at all. All in all, if you want a game that makes you feel like a true slayer of beasts, then MH4U will not disappoint you.. One of the best MH games. They played with new mechanics that can be hit or miss even for veterans. But watch youtubers, get a MH babysitter, and one you get it you'll love it. I had to babysit my husband and now he's just as excited about new releases as I am.. The second best Monster Hunter game to date, being between World and Iceborne. Provides hundreds, even thousands, of hours of stuff to do along with bombastic gameplay.. The game is astounding! The monsters are unique, what makes every boss battle singular. The sensation of job done after every quest is awesome. The controls, although hard to master, are easy when you get and not a problem at all. Also, the weapons, including the new ones that other games of the series did not had, are also exquisite, you will always find one that will please you. Alone or experiencing multiplayer mode, Monster Hunter will satisfy.. Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate Single player game review hours played: 110++ hours mostly single player, and still counting (like **** tons of stuff todo) game played till: Story mode: High Rank - credits Monster Hunter 4 ultimate isn't a game where you just pick up and play why? the controls, its unique and perfect the way it is, and needs to take times to get used to, from camera control to movement and attack of your character, from using an item to throwing a bomb, the control scheme is perfect, once ya get hang of it,ask anyone who loves monster hunter, they'll say the perfect controls ,epic monsters, and hunt, and friends the presentation of the game is just the ""top-notch"" from beginning to the end credits, it just awesome, the cutscene that make good use of effects available on the game engine, the clever dialogue, the memorable Npc you met and chat with, and Cats, it just perfect, the story it has 2 main arc, Low rank, and High Rank..till end credits i guess and both are quite good, depends, but still far better than mh3u which the predecessor of this game , it also has free story dlc if u want more story, the main cake of this game is of course the experiences, the game added 2 new weapon, which one(Insect Staff/glaive) take good use of the new mechanic, the mount, where you can ride on the monster and staby-stab it to make ""MASSIVE DAMAGE"" to the monster, and leave it vulnarable for several second, that creates opening for others to attack and another weapon (Charge blade) is one hella of blade, is Sword and Shield and an Axe, can switch between those, to, it can unleashed a fully charged attack which looks and also deals a ""Massive Damage"" that felt sooooooo satisfying!! the new mechanic, the mount, actually does make the gameplay more engaging, you finally going to rely on your surrounding, searching for ledge to attack and mount it, it makes the Hunt felt much alive and immersive? haha but it sure is fun,the climbing of this game is improved greatly, it is faster and better in every way, the new ailments ""Frenzy"" is also great addition, which i will not spoil it for ya haha, Palicoes are back, sure , i miss kayamba and chacha from mh3u, but u can have 2 palicoes like chacha and kayamba and palicoes are much more useful than chacha and kayamba lol and u can customize their armor and weapons uwu Meownster hunter! and you can find more palicoes when ya hunt more cats more fun! with all the great there is also a kinda meh new stuff, which is the Expedition, unlike previous titles, there are no free hunt (google it) in this game, but there is expedition, there is an area called Everwood which are kinda randomly generated, have a different monster available depends on the ""rare scale"" 1-5. the 1 is normal/weak to 5, strong rare monster, (elder dragon might included) in everwood also you can find Artifacts, for me its a great addition Artifacts/Relics is Rare weapon/armor which you can clean it up, upgraded and sometimes are more powerful than your average forge armor, that is, super rare to find, as you need to mine it,yes mine it ,most of the time you can mine it on ever wood, those artifact/relics also depends on the Rare scale thou, look it up! its worth it! the content of this game, it is beyond huge! i felt kinda bad paying rm 125 to this game due to its massive Holy-****-Like content, imagine 1/4 of this game took me about 110 hours, and i also forge like 5 armors 4 weapons, and also DLC/Online Gameplay including Streetpass , also minigames like Meownster Hunter and Fishing? its super huge Quest, u find monster you kill monster, gathering quest? read the quest descrition uwu , and it just like the way you remember it Monster Design, most of the monster are mosters that are returnign from MHFU/gen 2 monster hunter, which is good, considering i always wanted to hunt those monsters, the MH4U new monster also very damn Cool!, the Gore Magala the flagship monster is sure is the BADASS!!

GO BUY IT NOWWW Rating: SHUT UP AND BUY THIS GAME! ITS PERFECT!! 1000/10 its beyond perfect. GO BUY IT!!! PLAY IT!! LOVE IT!! ITS GOOOD |*7*/. I find it amazing this game was so well liked! Just trying to play the game itself is an exercise in futility. I picked it up because I've been having a blast with Final Fantasy Explorers and a guildmate recommended the MH series for more crafting and monster farming goodness on my 3ds. Boy let me tell you was he wrong. The controls are so terrible 4 hours in I had become physically ill. I pressed onward hoping it would get better or finally ""click"". I could not have been more wrong. I've now invested roughly 40 hours and I'm done trying to have fun with this game. Difficulty should come from gameplay, not terrible controls. Fighting the controls to make the game even remotely playable isnt a difficulty mechanic, it's just shoddy game design. If you make it past what is easily the worst controls I've seen in a game, ever (I've been a gamer for 30 years), you are greeted with hyper slow combat, crafting, potion drinking, and even unsheathing your freaking weapon animations. The game just isn't fun, nothing about it is fun. Your palico is useless, hit boxes are super huge for your character and tiny for enemies, and enemies are many times over faster than you. It makes you feel like the game is literally cheating you out of a fun experience. I can think of many things more fun than MH4U, like going to the dentist, being in a car wreck, or listening to Creed on auto repeat for 4 years. This series may have come first, but Final Fantasy Explorers does literally every facet of the ""monster hunter"" genre better. The only thing that saved it from a zero review is that its pretty to look at and find new cool looking armor. Everything else is hot garbage.. With more than 70 hours of game (which despite everything is little for a monster hunter) I must say that the formula monster hunter is excellent but at the time of the battles it is COMPLETELY tedious, the battles are SLOW, everything is slow. Is it necessary for the character to flex after taking a position? some will tell me '' it is necessary because that way you do not abuse potions at every moment '' but let me tell you that in Dark Souls 1, 2, 3 demon souls, NIOH, Bloodborne DO NOT HAVE that stupid system and they work excellently as far as combat is concerned. What to say about the slowness of the weapons (not to mention the GS). Bosses are ridiculous that is, they have patterns of movements that are easy to learn but wait! If you make a small mistake YOU ARE **** because you will be late in stopping and do you think the boss will wait for you? WELL, NO! He will hit you in the damn ANIMATION to get up from the character, they will hit you while you take potions (because despite knowing when to take it the animation is so damn slow that the monster has can hit you). On the other hand, the damage of the monsters in HR and in G is absurd, the monsters do not change anything (apart from the WOW color!) Their movement patterns as I said are simple BUT IF YOU COME TOUCHING LOST THAT IS DIFFICULT? judge yourself. I am finally writing a review after putting 450 hours in. This is my favorite installment of the series hands down. Great mechanics, none of the new goofy hunter arts introduced in generations, an incredible amount of content, and streamlined interfaces which make doing all the normal tasks just a bit easier. This game is a seemingly endless source of enjoyment and excitement - much more so than generations. Monster hunter is not for the feint of heart, but once you have the mechanics down.... MH4U has the best story of all of the MH games. It also introduced the many ways hunters can interact with the environment that are seen in future titles. I think the game is lacking a bit in map appearance, but it makes up for that with the addition of some awesome new monsters. The Gore Magala is the true star of this game and its effect on the story makes this game so addicting.. Surprisingly linear for a game like this. No open-world, just a hub and levels you can choose. I would at least have liked to enter the different areas as I please instead of choosing a quest and getting into one with a time limit and quest task to finish. Also way too much handholding, progression feels like on rails and the story is pretty bland too. But besides I really enjoy the beautiful art style and interesting & thoughtful gameplay, Very solid Monster hunter installment.. We all know the reasons why ppl gave this game a negative review. ;) (Lack of skill and commitment; they dont choose their timing with sharpening weps, healing and when to attack, etc.) It says a lot of wht kind of gamer u r if u dont hav the patience to learn the game. This game requires SKILL, EXPERIENCE and even KNOWLEDGE of items and monsters, to even get far. This game requires a lot of learning which can scare off and frustrate the weak like the few Negative reviewers who gave the review. Now this game is good, If u hav the patience. I hav over 2000+ hours and 100% the game. It was worth it.. One of the best and most robust games available on the 3DS. The new monsters are a joy to hunt and the returning ones are some of the best that the series has to offer. While the story is ""ok"" at best, the colourful cast of characters and the creative world they inhabit make the journey a charming and joyous experience. The gameplay and its multiplayer are as good as they ever were, and while new-comers might still have trouble adjusting to the game's more obscure mechanics, the game does a batter job at explaining them than any other in the series. Finishing the main campaing will take you between 30 and 50, while unlocking the toughest missions in the game (those in G3 rank) could take you anywhere between 250 and 300 hours. If you have a 3ds and you like action RPG's, don't miss out on this game.. People like this game too much. I gave it a five because the creatures are well designed and beautifully animated. Otherwise it is repetitive, limited, unintuitive grindfest that will sap hundreds of hours out of your life doing nothing but murdering the same monsters over and over and over again.. Greatly overrated. Monster hunter is only good if you are a kid with tons of free time and have a close circle of friends to play multiplayer with. Otherwise, there is nothing of value here. As a single player experience, this is a boring grind with no story. There is no real challenge, you don't need to be smart to win, just have a lot of time in your hands to grind and gather stuff. The graphics are meh and the controls on the 3DS are total garbage without the add on. All in all, totally overrated. Get this if you are a japanese fanboy and don't know any better about good western games, otherwise, skip it.. Monster Hunter is a series known for its complexity as much as it is for its battles with large monsters. This iteration does a much better job of introducing its mechanics. This is the most accessible Monster Hunter yet and also features enough new weapons to appeal to vets as well. The biggest change in gameplay comes from the verticality that is in this game. Scaling a wall and jumping off onto a monster to stab them repeatedly in the back is both tense and satisfying. Monster Hunter games are loot driven games and MH4 is no different. Its a enjoyable loop of hunting down your monster, grabbing materials from its corpse to turn into a cool set of gear so that you can tackle tougher monsters. Its also aided by some great free DLC as well.. I had an awesome time with Monster Hunter Tri. That game was almost perfect: best visuals Wii could deliver and best online service in a Nintendo console ever, including keyboard support and even Wii Speak (even though that device failed to work decently). Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate is a step forward regarding content and gameplay, but it is also a step backwards considering 3DS hardware limitations, most importantly, the very low resolution of the screen (on both standard and XL models) which makes it much harder to notice items and to enjoy the visuals. Obviously, 3DS does not support any keyboard and the chat options are much more limited this time, which is a problem in a game that relies heavily on team work. As a single player experience is a solid one but as a multiplayer experience is not as solid as it used to be. Besides, this game makes evident how poor the 3DS screen is. The 3D effect feels a bit tiring in this game, probably because of the big environments fitted in a small screen. This time there is no HD version like last time (Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate), so this is the only version you can get (same for newer Monster Hunter Generations). Oh, and you'll need the Circle Pad Pro or New 3DS if you want to control the camera in a natural way. If you can forgive the hardware limitations, there's a solid game here for you, but I can't wait to see the franchise in HD again. It can't be soon enough.. 200hrs in I still feel like there's a TONNE of stuff to learn. Once you reach the next level of difficulty you just start getting creamed again and feel like a complete noob. You can definitely play the lower ranks in a 'casual' way, but as soon as you get to the higher ranks it's more about the challenge than the enjoyment. Multiplayer is one of the best aspects of this game - coming from someone who solely played with randoms online. Great game, can't recommend it enough. Hands down my favourite game on 3ds so far and on any other platform as well. The immense amount of content and depth they've put into every aspect of the game is just insane. Every monster is so detailed and every fight takes a different approach. TLDR: Amazing game, but say goodbye to your social life.. I'm brand new to the Monster Hunter series, and only because i didnt know much about it besides, you hunt monsters... But when i made the fatefull decision to buy MH4U on 3Ds, I fell in love within a few minutes. this game is definetely not for the faint of heart, and im a brave little warrior, so when i got a taste of high rank quests- MMMM!!!! the balance between progression, Challenge, and variety of play style is so well done, i dont know if i can trully describe how much i love this game. furthermore, i got my hands on MH tri and MH3U, and i can see a dramatic improvement in every area possible. In a certain way of thinking, it seems pointless to just make new armor and weapons- but that is not even the half of it. The satisfaction of bringing down Dalamandur after countless faints is unreal, as you hear the triumph music play, you feel the satisfaction that you have kicked ASS, especialy after all the trial and error you went through to memorize the monster's attacks and patterns and trully earn that new hunter rank and awesome armor set. The Monster Hunter series is the only game i have ever played in which i WANTED to grind for materials. every time you fight a monster, its patterns vary, and you may encounter it in a different area, adding tons of variety to the challenge. Monsters dont fall because you mashed the attack button. it fell because you beat it at its own game despite all its superiorities in health, size, attack power and mobility. No game will give you as much of a feeling of time well spent when you've poured 300 free hours into it. this only scratches the surface of why YOU, yes, YOU should get into Monster Hunter.. I'm struggling to understand the massive hype thrown at this series, but still this is a solid game. It reminds me a lot of Phantasy Star Online (Dreamcast / Xbox) on which I logged many hours (and many £ worth of phone bills with dial up internet....) A hub area lets you collect quests, from which you can then select one and head off to try and beat it, in return for rewards. It's an interesting alternative to a full on RPG, though I found it to be quite repetitive in nature and would have preferred a more expansive, open world. Instead the main ""arena"" in which you undertake tasks is made of a number of very small zones, with a load screen as you move between each. Quite why this was necessary in a modern game isn't clear to me, but it does serve some small purpose - each zone has a slightly different feel and often different enemy types and collectibles within. Controls are strange at first and there's a lot to learn, but the game provides a lot of low level quests that are fully voluntary tutorials for various weapon types. Kudos to Capcom for not forcing us to sit through these (potentially, depending how well you do) several hours of tutorials before getting into the game. The only issue I found with the games was with the camera. It is difficult to track the enemies as you (and they) move around. Even with the New 3DS, which is detected as a Circle Pad Pro, the camera is easier to control using the D-pad provided on the touch screen. The game does provide a way to lock on to an enemy which helps a great deal... when it works. I haven't found a great deal of patience to learn the intricacies of the game, but I'm slowly and surely getting into it. I still don't get the hype, but there is something fun about this. For myself it's largely due to the aforementioned nostalgia it generates for Phantasy Star Online - the way your characters walks through enemies (even in offline mode - and a lot like the effect in World of Warcraft) which points to its basis in online play. Another impressive feat in cramming a full Wii game onto a 3DS cartridge. Worth a visit, if you're a fan of this kind of thing. It is bug free and well made, just not entirely my cup of tea.. This was surprisingly an awesome game! I had never played a monster hunter game before but I have to say, I am truly impressed. It is a great time waster as there is so much gameplay and content in this game. Everyday, I have an hour to myself on the bus to school so I can always fit in a couple of quests.. Monster Hunter is a series known for its complexity as much as it is for its battles with large monsters. This iteration does a much better job of introducing its mechanics. This is the most accessible Monster Hunter yet and also features enough new weapons to appeal to vets as well. The biggest change in gameplay comes from the verticality that is in this game. Scaling a wall and jumping off onto a monster to stab them repeatedly in the back is both tense and satisfying. Monster Hunter games are loot driven games and MH4 is no different. Its a enjoyable loop of hunting down your monster, grabbing materials from its corspe to turn into a cool set of gear so that you can tackle tougher monsters. Its also aided by some great free DLC as well.. Truly incredible. Im 10 months late to the wonderful world of Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and wish i would've gave it a shot back in February. Everything about this game is just wonderful. The weapons, armor, combat, graphics, landscapes and of course the MONSTERS are just utterly brilliant. I played Monster Hunter Freedom Unite for the psp very recently and loved it even if it was relentless to newcomers. I played it for about 10 hours and realized I needed the best version of monster hunter. I decided to get MH4U for the 3ds and so far have not regretted it one bit. First off, this game is so great for newcomers. Way easier than Freedom Unite at first which is a major plus. When playing, you're going to be gathering items, farming monsters for parts to craft armor and weapons, and upgrading said armor and weapons all so you can beat the next monster threat. You can buff your character with skills that are attached to armor and weapons and you can also attach skills to them with things called decorations. Eventually, you'll have armor and weapons that are suited for certain situations and certain monster encounters. It may be overwhelming, but if you get over that hump, you'll be hooked. Its, in my honest opinion, amongst the greatest games ever made. And its on a handheld! I couldn't recommend this title more. CONTENT CONTENT CONTENT! This game has a ton of content to keep you busy. The online multiplayer is addictive. And there's enough variety of Monsters and Weapon Types to keep you busy for hundreds of hours. The only major drawback is the controls can feel clunky at times. Having the circle pad pro or New 3DS XL C-Stick is a must. And the game can be daunting for newbies. Overall this is the best Monster Hunter game in the series.. Just Amazing game. Every Monster Hunter gives us something new and this one gives us new gameplay, new weapons, monsters & items. New vertical movement is very good. Must have!. +Continuous downloadable content +Ongoing challenges +Dynamic jump action +Monsters such as the movement of real living things -Strange weapon balance -Stuffy movement(use item,hit a huge damage) -harder singleplay -Terrible Ultimate stories -Difficult skill set. 6 months after release, I've put in more than 650hrs into this game, and has only reached HR 465 and that says a lot. I've cleared all quests(Caravan, Guild, Episodic) and made armor sets for all 14 weapon types. The good: +Superb gameplay +Top-notch animations +New weapons and locales +Mounting +Replayability +Online Co-op +New items +Varied weapons and armor designs The bad: -Bland textures -Controls take some getting used to -Other hunters can't hit monster while mounted -Steep learning curve Monster Hunter(MH) has never been about story, but surprisingly MH4U did pretty well in this regard. You start off as a caravan hunter who nobody expects much or relies on, till you gradually garner respect of pretty much every one in everywhere (Basically what happens in all MH games) But one of the good things in this iteration is that, as you progress through the Caravan Quests, your caravan moves to other villages and you as a hunter helps solve the monster problems that plague the said village. This is really a fresh idea as the past MH games have you being in the same village all the time. It really gives you the sense of adventure, and you keep wondering where you'll end up next! We can't talk about an MH game without talking about the stars of the series - the Monsters! Like every new installment, there's bound to be new monsters. Take a look at the game's cover art and you'll notice the Gore Magala, MH4U's flagship, a black, monstrous beast that seemingly has no eyes for sight. The thing is, it uses a pair of horn-like features called feelers on its head to detect movement, much like an insect's antennae. And the game even goes out of its way to explain this, in which you can tell the attention to detail Capcom has put into when developing this game. Each new monster feels unique, the Gore Magala's wingarm starts to have a purplish glow when it is near enraged, the Kecha Wacha hangs onto canopies to encourage you to explore the game's new verticality, the Tetsucabra uses its strong tusks to dig out a huge boulder and","""monster hunter 4"" is one of the best games i've ever played on the 3ds . it's an open world action game that a player can level and customize its character in many ways it pleases . the story is fine and monsters are fair, and rewards smart gameplay ."
899.Patapon,"My experience with this charming and undeniably addicting rhythm game was extremely fun the whole way through. The fusion of rhythm and RTS (real-time strategy) elements made this a new and unique experience for me. The gameplay is simple; hit 4 buttons in a sequence to guide the Patapons through levels and boss fights. However, you need to lock in and *feel* the rhythm if you want to succeed, as it's not very forgiving if you make even the slightest mistakes. It's somewhat short, with my total play time reaching around the 15 hour mark. Those 15 hours were very well spent playing this game, and I'd recommend starting with this one in the series if you're new to the series and/or if you want to learn the lore of the Patapons.. Very unique, fantastic atmosphere, amazing gameplay, awesome music. The only problem: i **** at rythm games, so i never beat it. I really, really wanted to but it was just impossible. I wish it had an easy mode so you could directly control the soldiers.. Nice, cute rhythm game with a unique system of upgrades between levels and easter eggs. The worst of the trilogy, but still, it's absolutely stellar! The gameplay is easy and fun and the story is great!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Perfect rhythm game,with unique graphic style and kindly humor,it's very fun to play. My favorite rhythm game ever! Plenty of content and so much fun! Man I wish they make a fourth one for the Vita!. A really good game, there are lots of cool things about it and it is a lot of fun to play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Although I only played patapon for a short period of time..(After that I gave my PSP to my mum because she always said to me that she wanted a portable movie player LOL)..I have to say that I have never met such a innovative and impressing game **** rules are simple, as well as the core idea of the **** just follow the rhythm and perform appropriate reaction for your order..maybe all masterpieces are based on something simple **** example, super **** which you just need to jump... Good god is this game addicting. I've loved rhythm games since I started playing Rhythm Heaven, but this one was even better for me because it was also an adventure! I still hear ""pata pata pata pon"" and ""pon pon pata pon"" in my head as I'm falling asleep sometimes. In addition to the storyline mode, the mini-games were just as fun (some of them even more fun). Great game to waste your life away and to have a great deal of addicting fun while it **** away your life.",the fusion of rhythm and RTS (real-time strategy) elements made this a new and unique experience for me . the gameplay is simple; hit 4 buttons in a sequence to guide the Patapons through levels and boss fights . i'd recommend starting with this one in the series if you're new to the series .
9.Red Dead Redemption 2,"One of the best games ever made and possibly best story in video game history.. This is the best rockstar game ever made, no question about it, and definitely in contest for the greatest game ever made. Compelling story and characters with so much to do it takes you 200+ hours to do everything normally, not mentioning the online mode. The map, over 3x as big as red dead 1’s map, is AMAZING. Every single town feels vibrant and alive with so many interactions its a challenge to see one twice.. Red Dead Redemption 2 is undeniably a remarkable game that represents a tremendous leap of what a game should be. Whether you are riding or walking there is always something to do or see. The world is built beautifully and rich in detail. It is a single-player game, at times it can even be a meditative soul soothing experience, where you are riding through the mountains and bemused by the unexpected encounters. The writing and the characters that you come across which are intricate and unique touch every single player who has ever played the game irrespective of their age. It is a story driven game that, along with terrific graphics, voice acting, and music, adds to the writing which sets it apart from everything **** if you still haven’t tried it, you’re indeed missing one of the best games which have been ever created.. Best game i played in my entire life, the only one that made me cry like a bay. game of the century, best of all time, best voice actors best story, best characters, best environment , with best gameplay. variety of lifestyle missions and rough suffering luxuries experience full of mixture of all life aspects.. Best open world in the history of gaming! Immersion and every step something new something so unique!. want to feel like a cowboy? play game. this thing came out 2018 and is still blowing my mind. modern games should be held to a higher standard. Anyone who doesn't like this game haven't really sat and enjoyed it, this isn't a fast pace game, if you cant deal with it, don't bother sharing your opinion.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What can I say? Interesting missions and an incredible lore. Everything is coherent with the places and themes addressed by RDR2.. This is the only piece of media that has made me cry. The greatest story ever told. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This Review is for the launch version on te base PS4. RDR 1 was one of the most influential games ever made, and this is a worthy prequel. That alone sais a lot. Rockstar managed once again to fulfill an impossible task. They could not have chosen a more interesting story than the end of Dutches gang, the end of outlaws and gunslingers, and the past of John Marston. All the characters are deep and complex. The best example for this is the protagonist Arthur Morgan who first seems to be the brainless muscle of Dutch. But the more you progress, the more his sensitivity comes through and he turns into a deep, multilayerd personality you can't help but feel sympathy for. When it comes to simulate a realistic world, Rockstar Games are just the best. The American frontier feels so real that it is satisfying just riding through it for hours. The graphics in general are some of the best in the industry. Although the base PS4 struggles a bit when a lot is going on. The gameplay is probably the most controversial part of this game. It is very slow, very simulation focused. If you don't expect that it might feel boring. You have to meet the game half way in order to really enjoy it. Take your time. Don't rush it. See it a bit like a good book you read. Try to enjoy it page by page. My only issue with the game is that the missions sometimes feel like you're on rails. There is not much liberty on how to approach a mission. You have to do it exactly how Rockstar wants you to. When you stray to much of the path the mission just autofails. In a game that is so focused in inmersion this feels very counterproductive. Aside of that, this is a masterpiece and one of the best games ever made.. This is a story – a collection of stories, really – about the decline of a way of life, as a small gang of outlaws tries ever harder to outrun the inexorable advance of American modernity, as well as the enemies and lawmen they have antagonized along the way... There can be no doubt that this is a landmark game. It is a new high water-mark for lifelike video game ****’s a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that’s patient, polished, and a huge amount of fun to play, and it’s combined with Rockstar’s best storytelling to date. Even after finishing the lengthy story I can’t wait to go back and play more. This is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era. Looking for one of this generation’s very best single-player action experiences? Here’s your huckleberry.Rockstar is the master of open-world building, of course, with nothing coming close to Grand Theft Auto V’s urban sprawl until now. Red Dead Redemption 2 feels more of an artistic challenge. You will not find a better facsimile of Los Angeles than GTA V’s Los Santos, but in a sense that world is already defined by artifice. Creating something as natural as Red Dead Redemption 2 is a seismic achievement...Going back to other open-world games after playing Red Dead Redemption II won’t be easy; this is unequivocally the most well-crafted and fully realized open world in video games. The attention to detail Rockstar poured into creating this bloody interpretation of a historical period is remarkable. The wide expanses of wilderness feel alive thanks to an unrivaled dynamic weather system, ambient sound effects, and the most ambitious ecology of flora and fauna ever seen in **** Dead Redemption 2 is Rockstar’s best game; a grand, magnificent adventure that’s vast yet intimate. It delivers a story full of drama and tragedy, not to mention levity and love, and it compacts it all into the most inventive and compelling missions and moments in Rockstar’s history... It's a landmark moment for the open world genre, and for the medium as a whole.Every nuance of the game, from plot to game design, elevates the entire medium of gaming to levels that have until this point only been made in empty pre-launch promises. What Rockstar has delivered in Red Dead Redemption 2 is not just the best game of the year, but the best game of the decade. It does not set a new bar, but rather signals a changing of the guard, a new future for video games, as everything that comes after will be launching in a post-Red Dead Redemption 2 **** Dead Redemption 2 has undoubtedly raised the bar for narrative open-world games and will likely have a lasting impact on how they are made in the future. It pushes the envelope of what we understand is possible in a video game. It seems that every time we get something new from Rockstar, things inevitably **** Dead Redemption 2 is a watershed moment, an instant classic, it's both another high point for a studio which has constantly delivered them for decades, and yet it's also a culmination of a journey, a journey to not only create a world that's interesting and brimming with content but a world where you can get truly lost. As a result, we have no issue calling Red Dead Redemption 2 exactly what it is, and what it deserves to be – a ****’ll get straight to the point: Red Dead Redemption 2 is indeed the most beautiful open-world ever created so far. It buries its competitors...With the amazing experience we had with Red Dead Redemption 2, we can say that the face of the open world genre has changed once and for all. RDR2 can be considered not only a milestone in gaming history, but also a lesson in creativity for the whole industry and, as a whole, a masterpiece. Not only is Red Dead Redemption 2 a complete and profound achievement, it completes a two-part drama that will remain relevant far longer than any of the other candidates this year has put forward.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. honestly and wholeheartedly gaming at its finest this probably my favorite game of all time the story is perfect the guns feel wonderful if i had to complain i don't like the horses but the story the guns everything else is perfect this a genre defining title and i hope rockstars treats the franchise with care and respect no mater what the next game in series may be. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The story is second to none. Genuinely beautiful graphics but the mechanics can be clunky and the hunting system is awful. The best videogame of all time. I have completed it 5 times and did not get bored. 200 hours in this game, i do not regret a second I spent in this game.. The story made me cry and i am not a peson that whould cry about a game or a story. Amazing and sad game but in a good and storyline way. Peak gaming, the game mechanics are amazing, you can do literally everything from fishing to hunting to robbing trains. The missions are very good and emotional later in the story. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Interesting game. i played on PS5. Gets boring towards the end due to similar ""go and kill"" gameplay. This game is like art, not everyone knows how to appreciate it the right way. It just borders on perfection.. Ever wanted to live in 1899? Here’s your chance. If we live GTA for its modern pace and breakneck speed. Then let’s love RDR for its mindful slower pace. It isn’t a game meant to be rushed, it’s meant to be lived in. Things are always moving. People, grass, the weather. The game wants you to stop and soak it in. Because it’s the last time in Human History the an individual can truly live free of rules and consequences if they have a clever enough tongue and a quick enough trigger finger. The gameplay takes time getting used to but once you do, it’s intuitive and user friendly. It’s a visual book. The writing makes you care about its people, its world, and especially, Arthur. It’s on the list of best ever games. Spoiler Alert!!!!! One of my favorite moments of morality in a world that isn’t educated around it—- Herr Strauss! America’s first Visa card and Arthur is the debt collector. Until he finally sees the evil in it and kicks him out. 100 years later we all have VISA cards and are proud of it, too. And there are countless moments like this. What if we lived in a world together where nobody taught us good from bad? What would be in your nature?. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game I've ever experienced, the story, the characters, even the dialogue feels so natural with everything. This is undisputedly the best game of all time. Now while it may not be the most historically accurate, man this is the most graphically pleasing game of all time and it’s insane considering it was created in 2018. Rockstar’s best game of all time, better than all the GTAS of all time.. A monumental masterpiece, the gaming world feels sad and empty without Red Dead Redemption 2. Let's start with the technical aspect, which is absolutely supernatural, and end with the story, which I consider far better than many Oscar-winning films. Arthur Morgan is one of the best protagonists in gaming history.. The best game I've ever played in my life.......................................................... Insanely detailed world. Extremely rich and well voiced characters. Amazing graphics for it's time and a real good story. The world feels so alive. The story feels a bit slow-paced in the beginning and you might find it hard to get reeled in but that would be my only major complaint.. very fun game, i liked how realistic it was with the environment and the interaction with the npc too. it was amazing the storyline and everything, this was an amazing game just like the first game. i wonder if we will get more games like this in the far future.. This is objectively the greatest game of all time. While not my personal favorite I cant argue with this game being the best. It has the best story out of any game I've played and has the most beautiful open worlds in gaming to date.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. a fcking mmasterpiec,bring me so much emotions. Spent more than 300 hours onit. This is definitely a masterpiece made with love. It is more than just a game, it even surpasses a company like Rockstar. Aliens made this game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Arthur Morgan is a horrible character where is My Johnny bear why did they make him ugly. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very good game, but a couple of chapters feel incomplete or unnecessary, for example, they could have removed Guarma and given more importance to Saint Denis and its characters.. It’s… eh, I’m halfway through the prologue and it’s losing me, i know it’s a tutorial, but it’s multiple hours long,and everything, including **** RUNNING, is restricted, and I am bored to tears, feels like I’m living the Amish lifestyle with how repetitive and boring it is during the prologue, I will update myreviewonce I reach the end of chapter 2, but it’s not lookin good.. Best game ever. Never felt so emotionally attached to a game and to the characters in a game. Genuinely my favourite game of all time, nothing will ever top it.. Too slow,rock star makes games that swallow your life, I spent one hour to trigger 3 times, the horse needs to walk 20 mins for a stupid video and after that, go back wasting another 20 mins of your preciouslife! Stupid rock star -- the same with GTA, you must travel from one extreme to another!. By no means a bad game but not my thing. The gameplay is clunky and slippery at the same time, the open world had some great things about it but plenty of large empty areas too. The story was decent and there were some memorable aspects but the chapters very in quality. On the other hand I did love the side quests (except the find random items around the map ones which I never finished), the random encounters were great and the voice acting was solid. Note: I never played the first game but from what I got it's actually better to play this one first.. Very Great graphics,story/narrative/characters with slow clunky control,unique realistic npc(when they greet you,doing their activities,etc)and satisfying gun gameplay.Strangely the game keep gaining more popularity over time(real life scary hardcore rockstar cult/fanatics also keep growing)overall its a must play games with superb VERY memorable stories/writings/events/characters(especially main character and his stories)that can draw you in,i just wish the character can move faster(their body feels really heavy and slow to control). It simply doesn't get better than this. It has everything there is to need and want in a video game. From graphics, to gameplay, to story, it's all impeccable.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this game means everything for me. my first playtrough was the best gaming experience in my life. I have never seen such a good story in both movie and gaming history. The characters are so good and written. When you are playing, you feel like your in the game and apart of the Van der linde gang. This game also does an amazing job on the open - world. There is always new interactions all over the map that will make you say ""wow"" the interractions in the camp is also amazing and you really feel like your apart of the gang. The game also does an amazing job in making it emotional and playing with feelings.. Great graphics great story great character development great gameplay great soundtrack, might be the perfect game, 10/10 for sure. The most beautiful, well designed open-world narrative-driven game I've ever played - visually and narratively. The amount of attention to detail and consideration that was put into every aspect of the world building and gameplay is nothing short of astounding. Everything feels so real, and similarly, everything you do has consequences - much like the real world. Another thing that really sold the game for me was how likable Arthur Morgan is as a protagonist. He's funny, charismatic, and generally (mostly depending on what you do through your playthrough) a good guy.. I feel that i’m leaving in the Wild West. Recommended if you like Wild West and Open World games.. If anyone has fully played the story mode, It will be guaranteed to be in their top 5 games OAT. Great game, great history, very good game play… the best hours I’ve expended playing video games. This this not just a video game it is also a piece of art, it is one of the works of god you know it's amazing.. Amazing story 10/10 one of the best stories I have ever seen in my life, but the gameplay is just okay, its very outdated and has concept and ideas that they didn't fully commit too like the other weapons. The mission gameplay is so linear and strict that unless you follow the words at the bottom of the screen and try to do something unique the game will fail you. Just watch NakeyJakey's video on it, it is very good and perfectly outlines why I think rockstar really needs to update their gameplay for GTA6.. Game’s good, ton of content and details, huge map and good graphics but nothing more. I strongly believe that people praise it as “the best game of all time” never actually played anything else in their life. I’m tired of seeing ppl everywhere on the internet glazing on this game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best game of all time, literally unmatched. Everything here is realized to perfection, the level of realism and immersiveness is unparalleled in the current video game market. 11/10. I cried over lots of movies but this is the only game that made me cry I went through some similar incidents that happened in this game, so I can safely say this is the most realistic game I've ever played as well.. One of the best games i have ever played the open world feels so alive there so much to do and explore and the story is 10/10. My absolute favorite game of all time. Everything about this game- the storytelling, the voice acting, the characters- it’s beautiful.. This is One of the best Games Of All time I mean the story the freedom and THE DETAILS Just beautiful IT's The Best Western game That Rockstar made.. In My humble opinion, Red Dead Redemption is the greatest game ever made. It offers an excellent story, magnificent open world, and beautiful scenery. This game is truly a masterpiece.. Read dead Redemption II From it's unbelievable landscapes, characters, visuals, mechanics up to it's narrative Red dead Redemption II is a overly Perfect Game, in fact it is so perfect that sometimes i forget that Arthur(the main Protagonist) is just an fictional character, i mean they really wrote every single character so distinctly perfect that you really get lost in everyones stories, it's just amazing what Rockstar achieved with this game. Red dead is like a love letter to old Western Cinema, it really feels like a real breathing world, there is so much to see and do that you don't really get bored at any time in the game, you alway's have something to do, may it be story related ore you're little Adventures with some shenanigans you do along the way. There are just a few video game characters that really hit me as emotianly as Arthur did, just an amazing game. Truly one of a kind. Score: 10. Arthur Morgan is one of the most beautifully written characters of all time.. It's a good game with a great story and great details but it's also overrated. Despite the good part, this game lacks innovation. The quest designs are the same as Rockstar's former games, strictly scripted, without the story it's basically a riding hunting fishing simulator, it can be fun at times, but these elements are not the ones to make the best game ever. Being great in details doesn't equal being the greatest game in the aspect of creativity. I truly wish this can change when they release GTA6 in the future.. masterpiece a game with living world and you play as a character in it what a good game the only thing dont like is the story ending Is fixed and Im cant decide the fate of athur. This is a true masterpiece, I don't know whythis didn't win the 2018 GOTY man.. idk what the hipsters and clowns are saying but this game is a masterpiece. absolute goated stuff. i wish rockstar didn't end this franchise & YEAH I DONT HAVE A HIPSTER TAKE ON IT. DEAL WITH IT. Great game, great story, but gameplay is too long, and it could be more variable. Red Dead Redemption 2 is often regarded as one of the best open-world games, thanks to its exceptional storytelling, attention to detail, and immersive world. Set in 1899, the game follows Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang, as they navigate a changing America. The game focuses heavily on themes like loyalty, redemption, and the moral dilemmas faced by **** plot is deeply emotional, with complex character development, especially for Arthur and Dutch, the gang leader. It explores the tensions between the old ways of living (as outlaws) and the inevitable pull of modernity, with the gang struggling to survive as the world they know crumbles around them.Aside from the story, the game’s world is vast, featuring a beautifully detailed landscape, dynamic weather, and a living ecosystem. You can interact with NPCs, hunt animals, and experience random events that make the world feel **** game also excels in character interactions and dialogue, with each person in the gang having their own unique backstory and motivations, which adds depth to the overall **** you’re into games with rich storytelling, memorable characters, and a world that feels real, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece.. Huge game, basic story. It's pretty mediocre in the writing perspective, but ever fun to play. The side missions and antagonists are more enjoyable to watch unveil as the story goes on, than the main story imo.. Greatest game of all time a modern day masterpiece it’s amazing down to the dot (must play before you die). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Lots of people say that this is the best game ever, but it's just so not true. Although the story may be amazing, the game tends to be really buggy and the gameplay is just boring. It gets overhyped by it's fans, and I don't know why. But still, the graphics and atmosphere are breathtaking, would play again.. Buggiest game I’ve ever played, every mission something happens that ruins the gameplay (Trapper not available for no reason) (spawning in mission after failing with 0 items) and the list goes on. I hope someone is reading this debating playing it for “enjoyment” and this message helps you make the right decision. 9.2/10. Great story in a gorgeous open world with so many things to do. Graphics are the best I've ever seen. Some complaints I have are the controls can be a bit clunky sometimes and I've found a lot of the mechanics difficult to understand/get used to.. it is a masterpiece in video-game world the story is great the gamplay is awosom and theg graphics are gorgeous. This is the gratest game of all time. The story, the gameplay, the world and the characters arevery good. I pass this game a lot of times and all the times it's very good.. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece of storytelling and immersion. Its attention to detail in the Wild West setting is unparalleled, making players feel like they've stepped back in time.. This game is so good do you know why...Because you can do whatever you **** feels so good.. Stunningly beautiful with a rich story but deeply flawed. The open world is great for creating a scenery but it lacks depth or anything genuinely interesting after riding through it just a few times. The story hooks you with the movie like opening and interesting characters but becomes totally repetitive and drawn out in the later chapters. Many of the characters are either so obviously evil (Micah, Dutch towards the end) or so obviously ""the good guys"" (Arthur, Jack) that they are generally uninteresting. The combat is not nearly good enough to keep the game fun for its extreme run time.. Game for masochists that like to brush a horse every 5 minutes. Than ride for half an hour to do a sidequest, clean a gun, brush a horse, be robbed, brush a horse.... Slow, sluggish. Repetetive. I tired to like it but i just can't. So many things are done here that serve no purpose. Art for the sake of art. So many pointles and tedious things to do. Why? It brings me only frustration and no joy. Very bad game in my book.. So good So funny So drama So sad So happy So beautiful So colorful So great Arthur is a greatest of all time. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Holy **** where do I even begin. First of all this game is just phenomenal, everything about it. The story is 10/10, the gameplay is 10/10, the graphics are 10/10. In my opinion this is the greatest game ever. The ending genuinely made me cry, and I’ve never cried playing a game before. Also… I love my horsey and my horsey love me. 10/10 game.. The reason i give it this rating is quite simple: Its not fun! You spend all your time following people around while they ramble on and you actively have to follow them its not a skippable cut scene. And you cant go do somethibg not boring in while waiting. Then the actual shooter part is just not working well you just keep auto aiming and shooting..... Boring gameplay every missions are repetitive story not interesting and I would not recommend the game. I hate this game, I think that read dead redemption 2 might be one of the most over glazed piece of garbage games I have ever laid my eyes on. I you enjoy read dead redemption 2do not come near me.. A LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE! There's few games out there that haunt you for weeks after completing them,and,red dead redemption 2 probably tops them all. Some of the best written characters ever, most of which,(if not all) you'll get attached to, and, a story about finding your purpose amidst the chaos of an outlaw's life on the run. The acting is perfect and is considered legendary and for good reason. The graphics and game mechanics are revolutionary and many newer games pale in comparison. If you want to play a new game and haven't played rdr2,just go buy the game ASAP!!!. it took me a while to fell in love with it, but once i played like 4 or 5 hours and when i really got into the story, the i realized this game is amazing.. Good Gameplay, Good Story, Plenty of Good side stories, Good Voice Acting, Decent Facial Animations. This is really a game where you can put your real life on hold and just escape to. At least until you get tired of the game, and start playing something else. Not an easy game to 100% though.. One of the best games ı have ever seen! The story, open world, gameplay everything is perfect rockstar did it again, open world is very detailed ı recomend everyone to play that game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of a kind in its plot, gameplay and details. Its so sad they did not put work into the multiplayer like they did with GTAV. That would make it even more perfect than it already is.. If you aren't really a gamer and you only play ONE video game in your entire life... make it this one. This is more than a video game. This is art crafted by an artist with an obsessive passion for a muse that has entirely consumed them... in the best way possible.. Goat game goat game.....................,....................................................... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of those games that pulls you in and doesn’t let go. Every bit of the world—from the stunning open landscapes to the little towns and characters you meet—feels alive. The story is deep and messy, full of tough choices and emotional moments that make you really care about what happens. Even the slower parts feel meaningful because of the detail packed into everything around you, like the changing weather or the way animals react to you. It’s not the fastest-paced game out there, but if you’re up for a journey, it’s unforgettable.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What a game. Great story with such a good ""ending"" (sorta, it's a prequel after all). The gameplay has the typical Rockstar Games feel. The game-world is insane; there is a lot of depth and the world feels alive. Only negative is that it's still only 30 fps on PS5. 60 fps patch would have been awesome.. This game gives you so much. Beautiful graphics, rich characters, and one of the best plots in a game you will ever see. This is one of the best of all time.. Probably the game with the very worst mechanics that I have ever played. Hold a bow string for more than five seconds? You are now exhausted and need to eat to recover. Fleeing from an enemy? They will still hit you with a revolver at 300 paces with pin-point accuracy. The janky save game and mission start/stop mechanic inherited from GTA also work very poorly in this game. Slow and boring, this game takes forever to get into, and the poor mechanics of the game are a constant irritant.. In my opinion this is the greatest entertainment product I've ever **** story and the characters are amazing and the details mind-blowing. It's totally worth buying if you haven't already!. One of the best games ever created. First few hours might be a little slow, but 90% of the game will keep you on the edge of your seat. Most hearbreaking and deep gaming experiences I have ever had.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is a masterpiece **** one of the best games of all **** story, the gameplay, the characters everything in this gameit's great. If you are looking for a good story game. Buy this game, trust me.. Beautiful game. Personally I think this game has the greatest graphics in any game I've played. Amazing story, characters, and combat. Insane realistic as well as it's attention to detail. Masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game ever, deep story, gigantic map, gameplay, immersion, best graphics even 6 years after, strong characters. Cant do simple things like enter a stagecoach while movinhg, supposed to be a cool game, but wrecks experiences, and only lets players do selective things in the wolrd like forced players to play the game the games way, so many better games, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. GARBAGE GAME, and heres why: 1. Wayyyyy too expensive alfor buying a game that takes youe WHOLE SYSTEM 2. WRECKS EVERY SINGLE EXPERIENCE 3.EVERY TIME that you die durijg a mission you get respawned halfway through the mission wondering what in the hell just happened. THIS GAME A IS A JOKE AND YOU WOULD REGRET SPENDING $20 ON THIS GARBAGE. Wow! this game is real? Red Dead Redeption 2 is the BEST GAME on the world.. This... This is art! I have played a lot of games in my life but none have had me as invested as this one, the story is really amazing, very complex and dramatic, once you get to the ending and after had spent hours with the characters you fee attached to them. It's a roller coaster of emotions, although the epilogue it's kinda slow, the rest of the game is amazing and the game mechanics are awesome too, easy to understand and enjoy.. I just can't get over this game, I really think this is the best story every put into any game ever. My favorite protagonist in any game to date, every character feels alive and even though the gameplay it's a little dated and it's a slowburn experience, trust when I say it pays off. This is a life-comsuming game if you click with it, you'll get one of the best redemption arcs put into any media and an unforgatta","if you haven't tried it, you're missing one of the best games ever created . it is a story driven game that, along with terrific graphics, voice acting, and music, adds to the writing which sets it apart from everything else . interesting missions and an incredible lore ."
90.The Last of Us Part II,"People took TLOU 1 has a power fantasy where you could project yourself into the main character (Joel) in protecting a little girl from evil thinking you were doing the right thing, always. TLOU2 unfortunally doesn't do that, (actually not even TLOU1 wants you to feel the game as power fantasy but people did) TLOU2 wants to tell a story of a character, not about you, it wants you to empatize with character not project into them and that's why people hate a great story about revenge and redemption. terrible. I am not a fan of the story and the game is very trash and rather eat a rock. The gameplay may be good, atmosphere,dynamic everything may be cool but the story? #How to ruin a perfect plot at the second part. mid story bad very bad ending good gameplay, really really good what a **** ending i saw from this one. Great design, music, sound, cinematics ruined by woke agenda driven unrealistic characters, revenge story contrivances and horrible plot and pacing. Neil Druckman is delusional and pathetic for making us try to believe his fairy tales about gender roles.. This game is in the top 5 in the world's best game rankings, the atmosphere of the game, the story, the atmosphere, the graphics are all amazing.. The new characters weren't interesting to me. The pacing felt drawn out. The shooting & combat is fine. Graphics were nice.. No sense of progression in people. Every dead character is never is like canonfodder and forgotten. Just a revenge story that drags on and is worse than Naughy dog's perfect homework that was the first game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is kind of like those burgers that you see in McDonald's commercials, they look great but they're made from plastic and glue. The game is visually stunning but unfortunately the story is a generic revenge plot that is told in a way that is beyond sub par. It takes beloved characters and forces them to behave uncharacteristically in service to a contrived plot that reeks of pretentiousness. The story itself tells events out of order and from multiple perspectives in an attempt to make you feel the consequences of your actions. This is poorly executed and actions that you took 6 hours ago which held no weight to them prior to context are suddenly thrown back in your face but by this time we've already moved on, it's too late to **** attempt at humanizing the game's villain falls flat and becomes infuriating after a certain amount of time, we are forced to play as the primary antagonist of the game for around 10 hours during which time we are mercilessly beaten over the head with attempts to show that this character is just a regular human being with relationships and problems not so different to Joel and Ellie, which is accentuated not so subtly by flashbacks in which the two lead characters of the game are shown in near identical situations. The problem with this attempt at humanization is that the group in discussion has committed an act that will make the vast majority of players loathe the thought of their existence, let alone the attempt at redemption. The attempt itself is also poorly executed often relying on situations in which the characters are shown caring for animals or children. It's as if Niel Druckmann suddenly forgot how to write a compelling character without using crutches.Character development in game is essentially non existent, the story being told doesn't allow for much growth by either of our lead characters as it's told in a relatively short period (3 days). The supporting cast is well acted but we are never given enough time with these characters to learn anything about them or develop any sort of attachment despite them being rather important to the narrative. The dialogue between characters feels forced and messy and as a consequence their relationships feel **** ending is one of the bigger issues I had with the game, It's drawn out and nonsensical all in order to hammer home the absolutely groundbreaking message that this game delivers which is essentially that revenge is bad. Genius, I know. This point was more than sufficiently hammered in throughout the story and the ending did not need to be compromised to give us another example of how terrible revenge is.This story should have been told within the same universe but with original characters, at least then it would only be a sub par sequel and not an insult to the characters that we know and adore, as well as the audience that purchased this game based on the good will that Naughty Dog earned with the **** you have any love or nostalgia towards ""The Last of Us"" then don't play this game, it will alter your perception of the characters and leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth. Knowing where this story leads will likely make it more difficult to enjoy the original game for the masterpiece that it was.. In the game The Last of Us Part I, the most important and captivating aspect that emotionally connected players to the game was the story—its depth and the relationships between the characters, despite their limited number in the first part compared to the second. Unfortunately, in the second part, the story was completely ruined, becoming a cheap narrative designed to achieve ideological goals and certain agendas. The most critical element of the story, which is the logical and sequential development of the characters, was abandoned. Characters no longer adhered to their values, beliefs, and goals, and these changed suddenly without any reason or justification, making their objectives meaningless. This undermined the sense of value in the 25 hours of gameplay. Regardless of how poorly the characters and events were written, the main goal and idea that the game tried to convey were clichéd, cheap, and executed in the worst possible way. I am not sure if the problem lies with the new writer's involvement, which literally ruined everything, or if Neil Druckmann was writing the story while drunk. As for the gameplay, which is the second most important aspect of the game, it was excellent at the very least—highly enjoyable. The AI of the enemies and the level design exceeded expectations, and the linear moments in the game were also excellent, even though they were few. The graphics were arguably the best created for the PS4 generation. However, for me, the story was the most important part of the game, and honestly, it fell short of all expectations, sinking to a level below mediocre.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I don’t even know how to put into words what The Last of Us Part II made me feel. This game is everything. It’s not just about the story or the gameplay, It’s about the way it grabs your heart, smashes it into pieces, and somehow makes you thankful for the experience.I felt it all: anger, sadness, hope, guilt, love, and moments where I just sat there, staring at the screen, trying to process what just happened. There were times I was crying, times I was physically tense, and even moments where I caught myself smiling because of how human and heartfelt it all felt. It’s been a long time since a game hit me this **** gameplay itself is fantastic. The combat feels so intense, and every encounter feels like life or death. But it’s not just the action—it’s the quiet moments that really hit you. Those scenes where Ellie picks up her guitar or where you just take in the world around you? They’re beautiful and gut-wrenching at the same **** the story… oh man, the story. I know some people found it divisive, but for me, it was perfect because it’s not afraid to get messy. It doesn’t give you easy answers. You’re going to feel conflicted, maybe even angry at what happens, but that’s the point. It makes you see things from every angle, and it makes you think. By the end, I felt drained—but in the best way **** characters are what make this game so special. Ellie’s pain, Abby’s struggle, Joel’s legacy—it all feels so real. Even when I didn’t agree with a character’s decisions, I could understand them, and that’s rare. The performances are incredible, too. Ashley Johnson and Laura Bailey absolutely crushed it.Yeah, the pacing slows down a bit in places, but honestly? I didn’t mind. It gave me time to breathe and really soak everything in and it needed that. I honestly liked the second half of the game even more because of how psychedelic everything felt it reminded of Apocalypse Now. This isn’t just a game—it’s an emotional journey. It’s brutal, it’s beautiful, and it’s unforgettable. If you’re willing to go through the emotional rollercoaster, you won’t regret it. I’ll be thinking about this one for a long, long time. P.S. I'm so excited for Part III!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 11/10 It is preciously rare to find a narrative with an impact like this. It is a really unique experience the first time, and I was lucky enough to experience the game without any spoilers. The themes are well-explored, and the character arcs well-developed. By the end, I was left stunned, emotionally-drained, and with a bitter-sweet feeling: I wouldn't trade it for the world. As a sequel to the good first game, it should be no surprise that it continues as a tragedy, which might not be for everyone, but I'd strongly advice everyone to sit down and play through it. The gameplay is fun and well-crafted, a refinement of the first game. The graphics remain the best I've ever seen (with the possible exception of the remake). The only slight criticism I have is that the pacing is somewhat uneven; however, this does not detract much from the overall experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is a bait and switch. The first Game is one of my all time favorites. This game takes everything loved about the first and turns it on its head. Characters act completely differently than they would or should and everyone is far worse off with little to no justification. Without going into spoilers “Misery Simulator” is an easy way to describe it. If you truly loved the first one skip this game and pretend the series ended with the first game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pros: Gameplay and graphics are good Cons: The amount of plot holes in the story is unhinged, it makes Uwe Boll movies look like masterpieces compared to this.. The best of the worst stories in a video game ever.That's the best way to put it and i didn't like it in the slightest. Gameplay, graphics and the gore are spectacular. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the most brutal yet heartwarming video games of all time. The way that this game combines the way of life in a post apocalyptic world and the personal problems of a teenager seeking revenge for her father's murder is truly outstanding. 10/10 in my opinion, would definitely recommend.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A horrible HORRIBLE game, a disgusting preachy mess filled with plot holes, unlikeable characters, unsatisfying arcs, and complete destruction of previously established characters. Asides from the terrible writing it has good graphics and mechanics, only to be utterly wasted on such a bad story. The only person who could come up with this is a pretentious, narcissistic mediocre writer which has somehow been gaslit into believing he is a half decent writer. He is not and it shows.. The game is very poorly written with characters from the first game behaving like complete idiots. The writers tried so hard to force players to like their new annoying characters but it all felt like poor attempts at manipulating people. The game also has way too many cheap deus ex machina scenes. The graphics and gameplay are good, though it doesn't offer much compared to the first game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Woke ass game. Ignore it and just play part 1 or the original or pretend it doesn't exist.. This is an experience. The Last of Us: Part 2 is an emotionally draining, harrowing exploration of grief, forgiveness, loss, and so much more. I could talk all day about what this masterful piece of art means to me.. I feel terrible for the programmers and visual effects team on this project. Their insane talent and hard work ultimately went to waste You can sum this game ine one word: misandry Every male character here was either brutally tortured or brutally humiliated. I won't say anything about Joel, other than he would have used fake aliases. He would not introduce himself with his real name Let's talk about the other male figures: Jessie, the guy who loved Abbey (I forget his name at the moment), and even the sandwich-making ""bigot"". were all humiliated, portrayed as weak **** that wore skirts, while the girls wore the pants. Maria is the boss in Jackson. Did she kill a lot of infected in Part 1, and so earned the trust of people to lead Jackson? Nope. But she is born a woman, so she has definitely earned the leadership title. After all, why have Joel or Tommy lead the town. It's not like they did anything to protect the town (sarcasm)., plus, they are born with a ****. Can't have a white man be the leader in a Druckman game. That would be blasphemy. Druckman's boyfriend in real life: Anita Sarkisian would have never approved, and that would mean no brand new **** as a birthday present for Druckman from his boyfriend Sarkisian. Ahem, back to the game. Maria orders the big man to apologize, who by the way belongs in the kitchen making sandwiches for people he can't stand (see the double standards yet?) I personally didn't see what made him a hateful person! If there were indeed kids in the party, as the father of my children, I'd also want to say a few words to Gina. Gina could have taken Ellie outside or to the washroom, no one needs to see that, yes even if it was a hetero-sexual couple, regardless, a family friendly event is a family friendly event. This was no girls night out party in college. Jessie is portrayed as a weak idiot and so is Abbey's lover. TLOU2 = Misandry propaganda. This was a fantasy turned video game, filled with endless hatred towards one particular gender: men. A love letter from Druckman to Sarkisian, who clearly wants to see all men dead. Being born without a **** is an unforgivable crime in her psychotic world, and her girlfriend Druckman agrees. Last, but not least, while the gameplay is fine overall, endless collectibles **** the joy out of gaming. Part 1 had much, much better pacing, mainly because it wasn't a collectibles festival like Part 2. In conclusion: if every male character in this game were female, every one would have screamed ""misogyny"" and they wouldn't be wrong.. Love the combat in this game, so improved compared to the first one. The narrative however is not as strong as its predecessor, even if it has some amazing moments. At certain points it feels like a slog going through to get to the next story beat and it could have been like 5 hours shorter probably. Most of the new characters don't add much of anything. Still, Naughty Dog proves they're the best in the industry at crafting beautifully realized environments, the animation work is pure insanity and of course the acting wonderful. Golf scene was a bit odd though but I guess I didn't mind it.. It was amazing, i thing the worse part for me was the inclusion of a new character who has not revealed in the past game, however, the game was really good, not like the firtst, but very good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Worst game I've ever played in my entire life. I've played some really bad games but none of them were designed to offend the player. Never buy it. This game made me open a metacritic account.. An Absoulute Masterpiece. Both gameplay and story wise. even though people didnt like some choices neil made, if you look at it objectibely and actually try to understand what itstrying to tell you could see how much of a masterpiece the story is. The gameplay is almost perfect.Every combat scenerio is extremely fun and it doesnt get boring easily. The only flaw is the pacing. With both of the characters storiesthe start is a bit slow and you might get **** after the first 2 hours of both characters the game gets extremely fun. So playing those 2 hours makes it rewarding. But still for that I am giving it a 9. If you consider yourself a video game **** not miss this game. One of the best I ever played.. This game is worth your time if you are understanding of how one can write characters in an insanely intricate way topped with that the gameplay and graphics are absolutely stunning. I recommend everyone to play the world.From the numbered works on it One is a masterpiece scenario section If we come Really A lot Engrossing And A sad and unprecedented The Story Narration style. It is probably the most controversial game of all time and even political. Many say it is “The Last Jedi” of gaming and this is a good comparison somehow. To be fair it is neither a 10/10 or 0/10 but they do a lot with the story and beloved characters that will deeply anger fans of the first game. You can also fairly argue that this is a character assassination for Joel and Ellie. We loved their story, character growth and becoming a family in the first game. This game is like the movie Joker 2 and harms what came before. I will praise that they want to try something different but point out the borderline between bravery and stupidity is very small. I dislike the story and the misuse of the old beloved characters. The new character Abby is already far up on the most hated video game characters of all time lists. The introduction kills all potential. Me and a lot of gamers just want to see her die after what she did. No spoilers but it is almost common knowledge out there under gamers what happened (Including many memes and videos). Strangely if done different this could be avoided. Even I had a similar idea that many point out. Create a situation where Abby, Joel and Ellie have to work together. A common foe of their 2 groups. Let them be mistrusting at first, even use false names but slowly start trusting each other. Save each others life and making the heroes journey together. Openeing to each other and talk about their dreams and goals. Seed some small hints here and there or even make Joel and Ellie swear they will help Abbie hunt down her fathers murder after this is over. This requires a lot of thought and clever writing to not give the twist away. At the end when all characters have won you completely over reveal the truth and let the player decide how to solve the issue. Now to the good things about the game. The art style and graphics are amazing. The enemy AI is better than in many games and the character models are incredibly good. The areas are not open world like but are bigger than in the prequel. I wish they did more here. Overall I am divided. I waited for this review because I would give a 0/10 without hesitation. Now that the dust has settled I will say the game is a disappointment but not a bad game. I give a 4/10.. Keep your woke **** to yourself. I don't understand how a human can from making one of the best games and stories of all time - last of us 1 to the hot pile of woke trash that this second game is. Blatant fake trailers, censoring reviews and hiding them, and looking down on his own audience??... I lowkey feel bad for the developers who made such a good environment, combat system and overall game (ignoring the story, writing and characters)... I even feel bad for druckman, what a fall from grace. To all the others who praise this game, go outside and touch grass ffs Hope you all find God and can escape your nihilism.. Someone framed it perfectly - ""It's a game about right and wrong made my people who think they're always right"". WT* did I just play ................................... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Playing this after the first game was harsh. The gameplay and graphics were obviously amazing, but that storyline was painfully weak. the game had great potential. the gameplay and graphics were top notch but the story was mid due to some questionable choices such as having to play as abby for 10 hours. also the game was too gay. im glad i didnt pay for it. Easily one of the best games I've ever played, and a pitch-perfect follow-up to part 1. There's absolutely ZERO reason for negative reviews other than political review-bombing. Don't take them seriously.. I don't get most of the hate this game gets. I was kinda hesitant to buy at first and reading the reviews kind of worsened my fun at first. But after playing for a few hours I have to say this game is really well done. The visuals are stunning, the gameplay is fun, and the writing is really good.. (No major spoilers) I wanted to drop the game after a while. I just couldn’t care by the end and started skipping the cutscenes to finish the game. If this was a stand-alone game, I’d say it’s underwhelming but fine as is. But coming off the first one, this game is just awful. It’s nowhere near the level of the first as far as the story. The first had a good sense of the beginning, middle, and end. I thought I finished this game at least 3 different times only to realize that it wasn’t the end of the game which I didn’t like and. The first game had the infected being the focus the story revolves around, and how the world changes due to the outbreak. While this game just focuses on the main characters and their quest for revenge, which is fine, but the execution was just terrible, and with it seeming like the infected were just there because that’s how the first game set up the world the story takes place in. I can’t remember a single moment that was enjoyable as far as the story. Gameplay is just the same as the first game, but that’s not what made the original such a good game in the first place. I just can’t believe how the original had me smiling the whole time the credits rolled, while this game made me happy that I was finally done, so I didn’t have to play it anymore. You can’t not compare this game with the first. And it’s sad that so much potential was wasted in part 2. I went into both games blind. The first had me excited to reach the ending, and the second had me wishing it was over. A game is mostly played because of the good reputation of a studios’ previous games, which is why people had high expectations coming off part 1. With how bad this game is, if the devs didn’t learn their lesson, the next game they just announced is gonna flop. Because people aren’t gonna fall for paying for a bad game twice. Me and others would rather be playing good games. I felt like I was tricked just because of how good the first game was. I would 100% recommend playing the first game, and 100% recommend never playing the second.. Terrible Writing. Neil Druckmann should be fired. Watching a character I loved get brutally murdered in the first couple of hours wasn’t great, spending three in game days murdering dozens of people to get one, finally get to her, she kills someone else and then it cuts back in time to the three days I’ve just experienced except now it’s the point of view of the person who’s now killed two people in my group. Then I’m meant to like her and relate to her while she gets plowed by her pregnant friend’s boyfriend, and then abandons all of them for two kids she found in the **** of it to end up with the character in there that’s still alive that I care about to end up killing how many people, not killing the one she set out to, and then being completely broken in every way and down two fingers.. ""A work of art. It's the best narrative I've ever experienced in a game—truly incredible. The way this game connects with your emotions is unique; I can't think of any other game that achieves this level of engagement. Give it a try!"". [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I didn't like the characters they were mostly bland and the story is awful, the ending somehow managed to be worse,. No matter how much I say, I can't express how good this game is. You can feel the soul and the message in it.Since the day it came out, no one has jumped the bar it set.I love it for the story, the technical execution, the atmosphere and the characters. I love everything about it, and I envy the people who haven't played it yet, but it's ahead of them. simply the best narrative in gaming history, incredible gameplay, fantastic facial expressions, beautiful scenarios... this game is perfect 10/10. a game about perspective. a hero in my eyes is a villain in somebody else's. if you let it take you on it's ride, this game is profound, depressing and beautiful. really one of the all time greats, despite what the unfortunately large population of incel gamer boys will tell you.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For me, it is the perfect game: the story, the emotions, the music, the atmosphere, and how it feels real and authentic.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The visuals, the gameplay loop, everything works great. But since it is a narrative driven game, I find the narrative to be out of order. The ending also didn't work with me, maybe I missed the point of the game.. Best graphics on PS4, great physics and soundtrack. Mindblowing story and deep message. It provides a unique experience, sometimes uncomfortable. It is a videogame that makes you experience the deepest emotions. I have felt like this playing a videogame before.. A game lacking quality and narrative structure, where its genre is predetermined, and gameplay and graphics are not intended to be its main focus.. Great game franchise ruined by niel. Waited for a decade for this horse ****.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best graphics on PS4, great physics and soundtrack. Mindblowing story and deep message. It provides a unique experience, sometimes uncomfortable. It is a videogame that makes you experience the deepest emotions. I have felt like this playing a videogame before.. In 2024, still the best 3d person shooter ever created together with Uncharted 4, Tlou has better shooting and animations, U4 has better movements overall.. This title went under a real storm of critics which, in my opinion, were not always related to the game itself rather than to some kind of disappointment of the average user against some developers choices. But hey, here's a secret: a creative subject is intellectual property of its creator, you may not like some choices of the creator, you may not agree with some choices of the creator but in the end the only questions you need to answer are: does it left something to me? does it work anyway even if the story was not what I was expecting? Simple answer in my opinion for both questions for this game: F***K YES. This game was a huge punch in the stomach emotionally. It's raw in its communication and it doesn't take the hand of the gamer to bring him/her out for a romantic walk. The world of the Last Of Us is violent and with no mercy, and the only imperative is to survive. It's a story about revenge and how deeply this obsession can change people, most of time in a bad way. It's a story about family and community, and all the things that you could do in extreme condition to protect those you care for. The game direction is sublime, graphic engine is at its best for the PS4, the dialog and narration are so intense, the combat system is enjoyable and especially in close combat it works well. Ok it's very linear in gameplay and exploration but it's a story driven game with the typical formula of naughty dog, so it's not an open world with multiple endings. You should not miss it. And remember: sometimes the bad guy of your story is the good guy of his story. Roles are often mirrored in this world.. Looks pretty nice, if dull. Very glaring pacing issues, disappointingly outdated (even for 2020) combat. A story that wants to be ultra-realistic but constantly breaks that. Very ambitious story but a lot of the character’s (especially the side characters) writing just falls really flat making them forgettable. For a game about how “revenge is bad, and killing is wrong” a lot of the canon points where Ellie kills someone were blatant self-defence? Which is really weird. Also it will never not be annoying to me because anytime I said/say I don’t like the game online people accuse me of “just being transphobic/homophobic” (I’m trans and gay) because the people who love this game cannot fathom anyone not liking it for a genuine reason, it has to be bigotry. I’d actually give it closer to a 2.5-2.8 or so.. Awesome. One of the games most iconic and important in the story. The story IS strong, like a punch in your belly,The game design is almost perfect, with a great IA, and the music of Santaolalla is legendary. This game is a jewel.. Enjoyed the story. It's pretty deep for me and reveals other sides of Ellie and Abby. One of my biggest weaknesses is collecting supplies - I looked through every corner and there were a lot of them. My special thanks for the card collectibles - I was looking forward to reading the next one. Uprading crafting, healing, weapons and stuff was not overloaded - I liked uprading as much as possible. Good mechanics, especially reusable arrows and infinite knife. Stealth mode is good, which I often used. Loved puzzles even though I got stuck at some (don't mean they're too difficult).. The gameplay and graphics are 10/10. The story isn't quite as good as the first ones but overall I actually think it is also a great story about revenge and the damage it causes and learning to move on and let go and is overall a good story even though I admit the story does have some flaws. Overall I legitimately feel the game is a masterpiece and love it. It's one of my all time favorite games.. Greatest game. Ever. Best graphics best gameplay best script ignore the reviews just play it. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. gameplay wise the game is great the script is terrible the unnecessary agendas are terrible the ending with no choice is unfair to the player. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If you hate this game is because you are a kid or because you are homophobic. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A game that just wants to make you feel miserable just for the sake of it... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. From a gameplay perspective one of the best games ever made! Production value is unmatched in gaming. From a story perspective last of us part 2 is awful and because it’s such a story driven game my score reflects this.. A great game just doesn't reach the same heights as the first game. The new additions to the gameplay and combat were welcome and well done. The story has different themes and ideas going on, and is alright, just maybe not as potent as the first game. Definitely got me tearing up more than once.. This game is much worse than the first one. The mechanics and design did not change. Boring story and unlikeable characters. Waste of money. The story simply DISHONORS the first game. But the gameplay is good. but considering the fact that it is a narrative focused game, this game is terrible. Such a beautiful game. People don’t understand about perspective, this game let you know that no one is especial. The gameplay is sooo good, great mechanics, tactical shi… Narrative is amazing, not perfect but is enjoyable watching different points of view, making empathize with other characters. Peace yall.. Cool game, but you’ve gotta play it twice to actually “get it“ when it comes to the story. The first game was about love, and the second game is about hate. The game is supposed to make you feel confl","great design, music, sound, cinematics ruined by woke agenda driven characters . pacing felt drawn out. shooting & combat is fine. Graphics were nice . story is generic revenge plot that is told in a way that is beyond sub par ."
900.Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword,"Typical Sid Meier's game: great mechanics, cool atmosphere and very addictive.. Best game ever - so fun to play with aggresive AI and dynamically changing situation - something that the newer versions lack. 4000 hours played. Still better then V & VI in many aspects.. The most fun I've ever had! I've been playing this game for a many years now, and all of the enjoyment is still there for me. I've enjoyed this expansion pack a large deal because of its new built-in [toggleable] modules and scenarios, which allow you to play this game ad infinitum without become the slightest bit bored; as you can completely change your experience [or the game] by applying them. I may be an extreme, but I recently re-purchased the game [without hesitation] after losing it, and in the past 4 months have played the game for just as many days [24 hours = 1 day]. I have not lost any interest in it at all. I guess I'll have to warn you that you may absolutely love this game.. ""Beyond the Sword"" is a great educational strategy game, I especially like the scenarios Earth18Civ and Earth 1000AD. Single player game is good for trying out a new strategy, but the real fun is playing it with someone together.. The pinnacle of the Civilization series so far. You feel like you are developing a civilization in an alternate world, but Civ5 feels like a board game in comparison. The game is very good as is, but there are also many mods that add more to it or even transform it into an entirely new game (e.g. FFH2). All turn-based strategy fans should own this.. I've played around 320 hours in total and I'm still playing, combat animations are not the best, but if you like turn based strategy game, recommend it.. This is and probably will be the best era for the Civilization franchise. I grew up playing Civilization and played every single Civ game and expansions, and I can say without a doubt that this expansion marked the highest point of this 15+ year old franchise. Civilization had its ups and downs, and among the fans there are still big debates regarding Civ. I really wanted to like Civilization V, it did not match the depth and complexity of the Civilization IV series. The graphics are dated, but that is about it; everything else is legendary. The opening music used in Civ IV somehow pumped me up, and made me feel like I can conquer the world. which is what this game is all about. Yet it is very difficult to do. I recommend this to anybody and everybody.. simply irresistible game that wont let hook up to anything but it. all u need is a bit of patience at the beginning but after that rest assured u wont remember anything else.. For some reason I found this game much more enjoyable than the actual Civilization IV. It's intoxicating and a the new elements give what was, in my opinion, an average game in Civilization IV a new life.. Incredible game. The series really reached its high point here. Incredibly fun to roleplay and totally immersive. Something we cannot say at all about it's **** number 5. I would truly recommend this game to anyone that loves a deep, complex, enriching turn based strategy game.. When this expansion came out, I actually considered it as inferior to Warlords. However, i have learned to appreciate it since then, though it did require time, particularly as I had to learn how to use the new concepts and mechanics. Now, still playing the game pretty often, I consider such innovations as corporations and espionage as exactly those elements, that the previous instalments lacked. I do believe that I'll still be playing this in the future.","""Beyond the Sword"" is a great educational strategy game . the real fun is playing it with someone together . the game is very good as is, but there are also many mods that add more to it ."
901.Dragon Quest Builders 2,"They took what was good from 1 and made it way better. What a gem. So much fun. Wish they made a 3 with this quality. Such a fun game.. Dragon Quest Builders 2 is the perfect blend of creativity, adventure, and pure fun! Imagine Minecraft meets a classic JRPG, but with more charm than you can handle. You get to build your own world block by block, all while battling iconic Dragon Quest monsters and helping quirky NPCs along the way. The game’s vibrant visuals and relaxing, upbeat music make it incredibly immersive, while the story adds a fun twist on the traditional save-the-world plot. Whether you're a seasoned builder or new to the genre, the satisfying gameplay loop of gathering, crafting, and questing is hard to put down. Add in multiplayer co-op, and it’s an adventure you won’t want to end. It’s creative, relaxing, and has a heartwarming charm . A must-play!. I love the game. It has everything i love in it. The only thing i dont like is some Villagers request are finicky. But still very playable. I love Dragon Quest but this one is not my kind of game, I found it boring, not fulfilling and just entertaining. I also skipped many dialogues too.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It surprised me a lot, I'm not into this genre but I enjoyed this game as a child. The story is really good and funny. Each island you go has it's own topic that feels great. Making creations in this environment feels really great, the guided creations and also your freedom. Rising monsters is a really good point. Combats are really enjoyable, at the end of the game more. The online possibility until 4 players is really great. Delightful. I want to play a DQBuilders 3 please!. Dragon Quest Builder 2 struggles goes through the same dilemma the main character goes through during the game. Without destruction, you cant possess the love of creating something from the ground up. Without the creation, you don't have the process of trying something new and tearing down the old ways. Juggling to be an RPG with a deep story while using the building mechanics of games the Minecraft. For the most part, both come together beautifully but at moments one side takes over when you need the other side to enjoy the game for what it could be. The second game in the series, hence the number 2 at the end of the title learned a lot from its predecessor. Like after boss battles your base is rebuilt from before a giant Dragon decided his foot should be in the amazing bedroom you just spent hours working on. Little things like this made DQB 1 infuriating to the point the building process was not the main focus. This time the building process can go as far as your imagination. Want to build a train station in the middle **** pyramid? Hey! We got you! A pool with a bar to have your favorite cocktail? No problem busy! But we will need to finish this 3-hour questline first. This is where the game struggles on the balance of an RPG and building. I had moments after unlocking new crafting options the game would push me into a boss fight or we would have to leave the island. I felt like a child shown a new shiny toy at the store and then it was put back on the shelf. You can have this toy later but first, we have to go to a place where you have to start with no toys and a crazy slime monster will talk to you. Which is cool, but I really liked that toy. Omega-Force has experience crafting amazing stories with their work in the Dynasty Warriors games. There is a deep connection between the main character and Marloth. Which was a great call back to the original DQB game. Creating a warm-hearted story that trumps the first one in a lot of ways. You feel the struggle the characters are going through and some of the decisions they had to make to survive. But not the bodybuilder guys, they are just weird and a little creepy at times. There may have been a few times I cringed at the dialog and didn't need to speak to 10 different characters to move the story along but overall well done on their part. Finally, we get to the mechanics of the game. The fighting and actual building took a step back. Besides a new move, not much changed here and the battles were at times too easy. Hack away at something and ran away before you got hit on the bosses. At times use a magic potion to heal up. Oh, then there is block placement when building. When building something at eye level you will need to either jump like a mad man or move to a first-person view. This can become disorienting when working in cramped areas or large structures. The plus side of the first-person view is that you can reach blocks three times higher than you. Not sure why but it helped me several times. If you can get pass simple fighting mechanics and at times some over the top cheese then this RPG/crafting game is for you. Omega-Force added enough to make this worthy purchase in the series. Go out there and build to your heart content! Just ignore the creepy bodybuilders getting massages.. Game Breaking Bug on the second Island. WTF??? No Chance to continue the Quests. After two years noone came up with the Idea to patch this? Threads are full with this issue - Still!!! What a Joke. Start all over again??? No Chance... Who the hell is programming this sh.... !!! What a Shame!!!. Back in 2016 Dragon Quest Builders was released, and was a surprise hit for me. Mixing JRPG's with Minecraft resulted in a fun and addictive game that let you build various buildings with a purpose, but also gave you freedom to create different variants. The story was quite adult and amusingly sarcastic at times. You had to rebuild cities in different locations with each having different obstacles, keeping the challenge fresh longer. There was an open world, with some exploration. My negatives for that game would be that there was a limit on how large the area of the city was where you could build a community, and that it was way too easy to reach the max. level of the city. So... how does Builders 2 fare? Story: It is noticeable that Akira Toriyama had influence in the making of this game, because it has become a typical cringy JRPG story with animé roots in it. Gone are the subtle adult conversations, gone is the sarcasm and gone is the intelligence. The characters have become typical animé stereotypes (dumb hot girl that needs you, tough anti-villain, goons that have the intelligence of a carrot). The survivors of the Dark Lord from Builders 1 are terrorising certain islands, and you are once again a builder that everyone treats like **** Only this time you got a buddy! He is Vegeta rip-off, and follows you around to act as the tough guy. Gameplay: The gameplay style is similar to Builders 1, with the addition of more room recipes, a buddy that follows you and helps you fight & collect resources, and a waaaaaay bigger world. In fact it is so large yet barely filled up that i wonder why they had to make it so large. The fact that they added fast travel points every 250 blocks should have made a developer wander: 'Why does it need to be so big?' In my opinion, more is not better. Using what you need, and making that fun is the best recipe for open world design. Building: So, more recipes and city building. The city no longer upgrades through experience points but by collecting lucky charms that erupt from the inhabitants arses. With every level new villagers arrive that start **** you about the lack of something. They harvest your food, but also eat it. So now you also have a job to keep them fed... great... Dragon Quest Soup Kitchen. Oh, and the building recipes are only given through a drip feed, so it takes hours and hours before you know the ones that you want to build. I would have preferred the way minecraft does this, where everything can be obtained from the beginning. Technical state: Works great. Verdict: More of the same with new stuff added. However, my two big negatives have not changed. The area of the city where you can build (and where NPC's interact with it) is still too small. The city levelling is now a choir as you need lucky charms from your slaves... i mean neighbours. Also, the drip feed of recipes takes too long. The story has declined in quality, and the increase in size is more of a choir than an enhancement of the enjoyment. To me, it is an average sequel. Not good, but also not bad. I give it a 6/10.. It's fun to make, but the story is very boring. In particular, I only want to finish the story in the second half quickly. If you like sandbox-style games, this is a great choice.. This is one of those games that give you a ton of entertainment hours with its campaign and, if invested enough, thanks to the endgame content and the creative nature of its gameplay, you could play it forever. In the end, that’s why I enjoyed my time with the original Dragon Quest Builders and, this sequel I just find it a better game in pretty much every way. The story, variety, RPG elements.... Combat isn’t just bad, it’s so invasive you can’t even enjoy the building aspects of the game without being constantly interrupted. There are numerous gameplay improvements over the first game, but it somehow ends up being less fun. Each area drags on forever, makes it difficult to build creatively, and the entire game feels like a glacial tutorial. It doesn’t help the controls are imprecise and frustrating. The first DQ Builders had a LOT of problems, but it also had a ton of heart and a surprisingly dire, emotional story. DQ Builders 2 has some cute moments, but the story is predictable, repetitive, and full of poop jokes. I only finished it because I liked the first game and hoped this one would improve, but it never did, and I have no desire to continue building after the ending.. Game is kinda fun in the first and second island and feels like the gameplay is building up to something, but the game falls completely flat on itself on the third island where the protagonist is showed as a gutless coward who can't even defend his friend, it's so disgusting you can't do anything and then you're forced to take back the dudes from that island back. I deleted the game at this point, really bad story telling and lazy gameplay design that builds up to nothing. Did you have fun in dragon quest games getting op rewards from mini medals? Here you get cosmetics and that's it. You can't even use magic and you're limited to 2 specials abilities during the whole game.. A charming and addicting mixture of Minecraft, Harvest Moon and Dragon Quest. It is part action adventure and part sandbox / building game. It is the best spin off of Dragon Quest and I was surprised how good this game was. It is the kind of game you can spend hundred hours and still enjoy it. The building is greatly integrated into the story. In each chapter you build new stuff and buildings as you get new resources, tools and ideas. Even when you finish the main story you have a lot to unlock, to build and to explore. You can experiment with new rooms and buildings as you build your own island to you hearts content. There are countless possibilities. The action adventure parts are a welcome addition but would be not enough for a good game if rated alone. It is however a fitting combination together with the rest. There is also a crafting system for better equipment, tools, armor and consumables ranging from healing items to meals that give you benefits. The characters are charming and I like the interactions between the main character and Malroth. In each chapter there are people with their own stories and goals you support. It is so heart-warming when you archive the goals and everyone comes together to celebrate. Like I said you unlock new possibilities by levelling up, progressing in the story, finding resources or building some new things. There are also hidden objects that allow you to rebuild them once you find them. Also the boss battles are excellent. You have to use special tactics here and it always feels great to overcome the menacing battles. For me this is the best building game I have played in years and an insider tip. I will definitely buy Dragon Quest Builders 3. There are of cause some minor complaints. Talking and changing tools use the same button. Often you start a conversation when you just want to change your active tool. There is just 1 save file and some scripted scenes feel like taking hours. Special warning: It has not a Shakespearian story or is that deep. It is more the enjoyable vehicle to carry on the game and I liked it for this. I even think a really deep story would be unnecessary. Overall the negative points don't matter. It was an enjoyable and relaxing experience. One of the most positive surprises in gaming for me and a recommendation even more if you like Minecraft and Harvest Moon.. Dragon Quest Builders 2 though suffers from a monotonous plot and a lackluster combat system, Dragon Quest Builders 2 is a fantastic sandbox RPG game. You play as The Only Living Builder, with their best friend Maltroth, whom are tasked with rebuilding islands lost to ruin because of the religion of Hargon. Your Builder can either be Male or Female, and can choose from very few hairstyles, but a nice list of skin, hair, and eye colors. Though I said the plot is monotonous that does not mean it is not good; in fact, it can easily be compared to a mainline Dragon Quest plot. It is fascinating and fun, with very memorable moments. The combat isuster because it is a simple hack-and-slash system. The building, destroying, and creating part of the game I think is the best that Sandbox games have to offer. The visuals are stunning and adorable, with an super-durpy cartoon style. The gameplay is smooth and relaxing. The plot can last 60-80 hours. (It lasted me 90 hours before I completed the plot.) Once you are done with the plot, you are able to build to your hearts content. With fun, adorable, a deep story line Dragon Quest Builders 2 is a super fun game.. A great RPG, that mix elements of constructions like minecraft and the classic Dragon Quest. It's really fun to play for hours, very recommended for RPG fans.. For me is the best building game of all time. It still has less to do than minecraft but the graphics do their job.. Overpriced garbage. Unreasonable number of QoL issues and horrendously BORING gameplay not to mention the worst combat ever. you have a shield but you can't block, and dodging is practically non-existant so any battle against >1 opponent becomes mash triangle and spam healing items because your NPC followers WILL be garbage and useless, and leveling won't help because each area has a cap. so enjoy that. Also whoever thought the interact button and the tool switch button should be the same should be fired. The list goes on but this game was supposed to be enjoyable and I just found everything FRUSTRATING.. this game is a much improved sequel and what I like about it is the story aspect of it, you aren't just given a blank world that you do what you want with it but you are given a reason to build stuff and proceed with the game. Story is pretty standard, but the building mechanics are extremly fun. The Sandbox Isle is the main reason that kept me going. Pretty much a game to chill after a day of work. Loved it!. Amazing gameplay I like dragon quest builders 1 and I return play dragon quest builders 2. It's better then dragon quest builders 1. Amazing building system with a lot of explore and to do. The first part of the game is slow but it gets continuously better. Dialogue is a massive slog, but can be skimmed through to get the gist of things. Controls are not perfect but you do get used to them. The thing that makes this game shine is the exploration, gathering, and building, which are fantastic. There's an insane amount of customization, and managing your citizens within your buildings/towns is the icing on the cake. Definitely one of the best implementations of gathering/building (Minecraft/Lego style) to date. I'm normally a handheld guy but I recommend this one on PS4 as the performance on Switch is pretty bad.. First game was great, this one is even better! First the bad. Multiplayer is not even unlocked til well into the game after the first, VERY long island. PISS poor decision. Had I cared about MP, this game would get an automatic 5/10 for this. SE is lucking out on this game for most players dont care about MP. Its total S**t Due to this, you absolutely not call this game a MP game. Most people interest d in MP want to do MP start to finish, together, as a team, thus is the point of MP. This is more like a stupid visitation system thats not even unlocked for a long time. That is not MP. For me personally I enjoyed it as a 10/10 solo. But had I bought it expecting to coop right away, I would have ben EXTREMELY furious about that. You do not EVER make a coop game where coop is not unlocked right out of the gate. Dumbest feature cap Ive ever seen in my life in a game. Aside from that back to solo mode > Post game actually makes more sense now and your custom island is actually used between story modes as its part of the story this time, instead of being some random non attackable island like in the first one. Rooms you make there etc all still feel like youre playing the story mode and just as fun. It is not lacking there at all like the first one was. Without spoilers youll just need to play to see the improvements as there are tons!. This is an astonishingly good game and has utterly captured my imagination. I dumped a whole weekend into this world, and I'm eagerly waiting for my chance to dive back in. My only qualm is that I occasionally feel like the entire game is a tutorial, and you're always sort of holding off doing what you REALLY want for that next step, but that's probably more to do with my personal neurotic tendencies than any major design flaw. The content drips in fast enough that I never really tired of what I was doing but slow enough that I still had time to experiment with my own little ideas. And there's a staggering amount of content packed into this game, so I have a hard time imagining myself getting tired of it any time soon. It's all the best features from games of this genre packaged in a familiar and fun IP, and all my qualms with it feel trivial in the face of just how much fun I'm having.. Ok for a solo player game,but I bought to play with friend, after 12h of game play still did not unlock the online, at that point i refunded the game.. As addicitve as the first one. With lots of QoL improvements. So you can focus more on the fun part and not on the inventory juggling or grinding. The fact that the sandbox island is part of the main story will draw you in and keep you playing it much longer. The only downside is that beggining is weaker and it takes longer before you get to the good stuff. So trying the demo may put some people off. And town borders and not so obvious as in the DQB1 so I already made mistake by building the blueprint outside the area by mistake. But it is really small issue.. This game is a worthy successor to an already great title. I dropped quite some hours into DQB2 and to me this game is not perfect but so much fun. I would rate it 8.5 so far but gave a 9 because the fun factor is to me more relevant than the minor flaws. Read on for more. DQB2 adapts all the basic that DQB1 already delivered in a solid and fun way but changed the game and story play in some interesting ways. Game world and story mode: ************************************** In DQB1 the story mode was somewhat depressing because the final boss often destroyed your town and even worse, it did not matter because each chapter was completely independent and you started new every single chapter. DQB2 does things vastly different with a centralized hub island and a ship that leads you to side-islands or main-islands. Main islands are where the story is being told and you will leave them this time also but you can come back at any time and the story islands are way more intensified. The first story island will keep you busy for 6 to 10hrs depending on your playstyle alone. Side-islands provide quick adventures on a pretty thin basis to be fair where the hub island appears as a free-to-build island with some story driven attachments. The new concept is more motivating to me although I see some missed opportunities. Sometimes interruptions due to quests-givers are pretty high. The quests itself are mostly very simple or just guidelines through the main missions. Hopefully in a future title they will enhance this a little bit more because the benefit for the game atmosphere is pretty good. Graphics // Sounds // Engine: ************************************** What can I say. It pretty much looks like DQB1 to me. Maybe a little bit polished. Loading times on my PS4 Pro with SSD are okay-ish but feel too long to be honest. On the bright side the islands are loaded once and other loadings screens do not happen often or are very short. So I would not even rate this down. Graphics are of course cartoon-ish for this title but very solid. I personally like it way more then Minecraft even modded but that might be very subjective. The sound and ""voice acting"" is still a clear downside for me. Most or even all of the dialogue passages are text-only. To me thats a missed opportunity still and not state of the art anymore. I d prefer them to take a step forward and present the nice story in a way it deserves. On the other side the character are cool and I like the writing a lot. As a non-native english speaker I still dislike that most of the characters ""talk"" with accents. Without a proper voice acting this is giving me some hazzle and honestly... makes me skip dialogue sometimes. Sad! The soundtrack in general falls flat to me and could be a little bit more entertaining but is still okay-ish. Controls: ************ DQB1 and 2 share a similar basis. For people who did not play either: the controls feel really decent for a console title in my opinion and not frustrating at all in comparison to other titles that seem to be perfectly made for mouse and keyboard. I was surprised with DQB1 and still like them. Some mappings are strange though. There are times where you want to change your tool but talk to your buddy etc. I see room for improvement here although there are some controller layouts you can choose from. Gameplay: ************** DQB2 is in my opinion clearly optimized for solo play. There is a multiplayer-like mode but it is not perfectly integrated which is a little bit sad and definetely a missed opportunity. In your solo story you are accompanied by an NPC buddy which is really fun and helps a lot in terms of collecting stuff and having a more dynamic feeling. Main focus is again getting materials, buildings, new stuff, but this time things are enhanced as you have more intense layered buildings, you have farming options and also your buddies will work more intensely for you. I like these changes a lot because they add convenience and atmosphere by a great margin as you try to develop your town, achieve quests for the people around and gain new recipes or blueprints to build. Final thoughts: ******************* I loved DQB1 and bought it just due to being bored at a weekend. Turned to be a lucky grab for me as I was really waiting for DQB2 and having a lot fun with it. I did not encounter any bugs or performance problems so far letting aside the loading times at the beginning. The gameplay is solid but got well enhanced with added atmosphere and a more quest related storymode. The characters are lovely so are the graphics. As stated in the beginning I would give DQB2 a solid 8.5 because it feels repetitive at times and misses some opportunities. It gives me so much fun though that I took the 9 with a tendency to 10. The game will provide a good amount of playtime (around 50hrs+) and is to me a solid buy for the initial price.. I absolutely loved the first game and this game is even better! I love all the characters, and they improved upon things I didn’t even know could be better!","the game's vibrant visuals and relaxing, upbeat music make it incredibly immersive . the story adds a fun twist on the traditional save-the-world plot . the only thing i dont like is some Villagers request are finicky ."
902.Dragon Age: Origins,"One of the best games ever created, a master piece. Deep lore, charismatic characters and a compelling story. You shape the world with every choice you make. Honestly my top game ever.. Recently started playing this again, and remembering step by step how good this game actually is.. The game that started my love for video games. Also the only video game I have tattooed on my body.. Absolutely fantastic. Still holds up with it's classic gameplay. The visuals are incredibly brown though.. What a game. Playing on the hardest difficulty felt rewarding and really made you think your tactics though. With a great story and twists and turns around every corner this is an easy recommend for anyone. One of the best games ever made. The music. The companions. The story. The dark and gritty world. Peak bioware gaming.. Played it for the first time in 2024. I'm a big fan of KOTOR, so I’m not surprised DAO turned out to be my niche. Amazing storytelling and really good character backstories. I liked the dark theme, reminded me of LOTR and clearly it draw inspiration from the movies. The game turned I it to be a bit too long for me but I guess that's up for debate. Really good, if you consider it’s age!. The second Dragon Age game I ever played. I am rating it higher than Inquisition, even though I like Inquisition better to a certain degree, mainly because overall Origins is a better roleplaying experience. There is far more reactivity to player choice in Origins than in Inquisition, the dialogue options are more diverse, and while I liked the voiced protagonists of 2 and Inquisition, the Warden was YOU.. My favorite game of all time! The writing, the world, the lore and the CHARACTERS are all so good. A complex villain (one of the best villains of Bioware), horror and meaningful choices. The combat is outdated but it's a true RPG and i love the tactical camera - unlike the awful combat of the new ""Dragon Age"" game.. One of the greatest RPGs ever made. This is what Dragon Age needs to return to.. Haters gonna hate, but this is game is amazing. Great combat, interesting characters, good storytelling. Loving it.. what a beautiful game,if you want a masterpiece in storytelling, replayability, awesome writing, This game is it.. Fantastic. Hits every element needed for a great game, story, gameplay, dialogue, voice acting, music and graphics (for its day at least).. Considering the current controversy concerning D.A. Veil guard I thought I'd have a look at 'Origins as it's available on Game Pass. The elephant in the room is that this is a 15 year old game, and it looks bad. Secondly, at least the first few hours are taken up with cinematic cut scenes while the gameplay is basic and repetitive. I chose to play as a mage and combat involves casting one of three spells by spamming the X,Y or B buttons and that's just about it. Movement is similarly limited, no dodging, climbing, jumping or even sprinting are available. The story isn't bad, in fact it's actually quite good in places but if you want a story read a book. In 2024 this game isn't worth playing.. One of the best RPGs ever created it still has some massive bugs where dialogue confuses the genders but the story feeling and Lore made it almost one of the greats of its time. Pretty much Lord of the Rings, but less interesting. The story is good, but not great. The characters are generally unlikable. The actual gameplay is pretty painful to sit through, hitting attack and waiting for the stun to wear off. It is barely considered interactive. There is a huge amount of loot, with most of it being useless. I just found myself frustrated by battle and bored walking between cut scenes for most of the game. This entire game would have made a better Neflix series.. I love this game. Of course even back in the 2010s the graphics weren't incredible but the story was absolutely epic! Dark fantasy at it's best.. The equivalent of eating a hearty meal and taking a warm, candle-lit bath after. One of the most well-produced and satisfying games ever made.. one of the best games i've played, and THE best dragon age game yet. The way the fighting works isn't the best of the series, but everything else about it is the best.. Very decent RPG. Probably, one of the best oat. Aged pretty well and still playable even in 2024. So where to begin well we shall start with the bad.Game is 100% feeling its age as the combat isnt bad but its fairly boring for warriors and rogues though mage is top tier, and whilst combat can sometimes be intresting if your like me who tweaks the tactics out of boredom the game honestly ends up playing itself and thats just boring, specializations whilst cool dont realy matter much especilly blood mage which in the world is despided but no one ever brings it up which makes rp very hard, overall just some minor complaints and i will add for those who see this it is not a bad game but these are just my gripes. now for the good, the story is amazing and makes up for literally everyone of its short comings as its intresting and keeps you gripped, the companions are intresting and unique, the mage combat is just stupid fun, and i can never recomend this game enough cause its a game everyone should play atleast once.. Game is enjoyable and the world builiding is very impressive to make an interesting and dynamic world. Gameplay naturally feels quite dated compared to modern games but is passable if slightly frustrating. The silent protaganist feels very awkward at times and was a strange decision. Some gameplay sections are very sluggish and take way too long Story is fun and feels engaging and fresh , some of the side quests feel empty and pointless. Companions are very fun and help develop the story more.. Fantastic story line, decent mechanics. Still holds up after this much time.. Great game, best in the Dragon age series. I dont understand why they abandon this game loop in sequels.. This game is a masterpiece, it’s a pity that modern Bioware no longer makes such good games and they are completely woke. Though it's a simple story, the game manages to convey it in an interesting way, and the various interactions with colleagues were also surprising.. An RPG masterpiece that I've revisited multiple times and plan to again. Stands out as one of the best.. A couple difficulty spikes are ridiculous. I didn't play this game on casual ever like I'm sure a lot of the reviewers did and I wasted lots of time on bad AI and RNG. This combat is more luck and min-maxing than skill. Bioware needs to learn to balance encounters. The difficulty variance from game to game, encounter to encounter, is embarrassing and simp reviewers just let it slide. Combat is clunky and too reliant on RNG. Ally AI is stupid even with tactics. Nothing like setting your Mage on passive and having them run ahead of everyone into battle. Half the time your Allies don't even do what they are programmed to do, even though you've micromanaged their tactics to the umpteenth degree. Tanks will just stop fighting in the middle of a battle. Had that happen a couple times. One time it even helped me because the enemy AI glitched out for some reason as my tank just stood there. Dungeon design reminds me of D&D dungeons that I designed in middle school on graph paper. Dungeons are circular and basic. Story Is Tolkien for dummies written by a grim dark teenager. Everything is just too much and too long. The end boss is just a damage sponge with adds. Don't make the mistake I did. Play this game on casual but ultimately don't play this game.. Quite possibly the greatest CRPG ever made. Incredible depth, insane level of choices and consequences thanks to it's unique Origin system, no playthrough is the same.. THIS is the real standard of rpg. A true masterpiece. A timeless classic. For today, no RPG that would be better than it. Only Greedfall could reach this high standard of quality. Reaching, but not being better.I replay this game almost every year since its release. And every time I'm impressed by how great it is and how detailed it is. AFTER ALL THIS TIME? ALWAYS. One of the most glaring issues with Dragon Age: Origins is its dated and clunky combat system. The tactical approach, while initially promising, devolves into a repetitive and slow-paced experience. The reliance on pausing to issue commands interrupts the flow of combat, creating a jarring and tedious rhythm that fails to engage players in the way a modern RPG should.. This was one of the most iconic games of my youth. A captivating story, with memorable characters that you want to empathize with. I'd love to see this series continue... if you haven't played it yet, I definitely recommend giving it a try.. One of the Greatest RPGs of all time. Out of all the Dragon age games, Origins easily have the best Story, and while I don't think the companions are the ""greatest"" the chemestry of the Party diffiently takes the cake. The biggest draw back with origins is that I aged terribly. Even back in 2010, the combat system was way to slow and janky, and the graphics and textures are extermely muddy, escpecially compared to other games that came out in 2010, or before. Still tho, if you are a fan of amazing RPGs, and you havent played origins you need to.. This is still my favorite game. I have completed it several times to complete each origin story. This was really the golden age of Bioware.. Very fun RPG, that does everything right but nothing innovative whatsoever.. One of my favorite games of all time. Brought a unique combat style mainstream. If you enjoyed Inquisition or Greedfall and can get over the 2009 graphics then this game is definitely still holds up well today. As a big fan of Dragon Age: Inquisition, Origins was a game I had long wanted to play, and thankfully, Gamepass provided me with the perfect opportunity. Origins has more than lived up to my lofty expectations, with the excellent story, characters, and quests I've come to expect from BioWare. I even grew to enjoy the combat, though its more tactical style is definitely not for everyone. The game has aged poorly in certain aspects (no fast travel, for instance), and the difficulty is a bit annoying at times, but overall, this is an easy recommend and one of the best RPGs I've played. Now I just have to decide if I really want to try Dragon Age 2..... This game is an absolute masterpiece worth playing over and over again. One of my favorite games of all time. The combat isn’t great, but the story and character customization more than makes up for it. 10/10 play it if you can.. An incredible game that set a new precedent for what role-playing games could be. Despite (arguably) dated MMORPG-style combat and primitive graphical quality (on the 360, at least), Origins' quality is uplifted tremendously by its incredible worldbuilding, enthralling story and some of the most compelling characters ever inserted into a video game. An absolutely mandatory experience for fans of 2000s CRPGs, and a highly recommended one for fans of RPGs in general.. Great start to a series, however limited by the tech of its time. The rpg elements of combat are very inticing as you can branch off or stick to one style if you want to. The cast could be stronger but your companions that do standout, do so in a big way. The story and world building is maybe the best I've seen for a video game. However the presentation and gameplay severely hold this back from being a great game.. Did my first (and only) playthrough as a mage and it was hard to get into. Gameplay was annoying as hell at times with too much missable stuff and no chance to go back.. A solid game. I very much enjoyed my time with it. My second time through was quite fun and that normally isn't the case with most games.. Dragon Age Origins was BioWare's first attempt at a RPG in an universe of their own creation, that now stands as one of its most memorable franchises. But was the first game as good as some people remember it to be? Pros: +Diverse dialogue options +Well written characters, story & world building +Various races to choose from +Different origin stories depending on your race +Classes & perks all feel distinct +Choices the player makes greatly impact the narrative +Memorable soundtrack +Companions all feel well developed & interesting +Some of the side quests are extremely captivating +Game has a perfect length (around 40h) Cons: -Combat feels slow & hasn't aged well in general -Enemies feel boring to fight against -The gameplay formula is stale and gets old quickly -Graphics, aside from character models, look outdated -Art style is dull to look at (grey/brown pallets) -Various side quests feel unnecessary Overall, Dragon Age Origins feels like a great entry into the pantheon of RPG's that have released throughout the ages, shaping the ground up for various other games of the same genre. If you're a RPG fan who likes or isn't bothered with a more tactical combat style, then I recommend this game.. The main thing about this game is the fact that what ever choices you make, it can be carried over for the remainder of the series.. Review 2021 first ever playthrough. So I've played the trilogy in the reverse order and after playing the 2nd one I wasn't expecting much from this but how wrong was I. It's not only the best dragon age game, its one of the best games I've ever played and I've played alot. This is a rare epic game and cant believe I missed out on this when it first came out but what a treat for 2021. A better story that witcher 3 and better told which is hard to believe. On normal difficulty combat is certainly a challenge and if you ramp the level up you have a game that is so much harder than anything dark souls can throw at you. The game itself is massive, so much voice dialogue and the chats between your companions are genuinely funny to the point you want to take out different groups together just to hear what they have to say to each other. Combat I played as a mage and nearly always 3 out of 4 of my team were mages just because I found using a melee character terrible, I'm sure they are ok if you play with them but my sum total was about 10 minutes out of 50+hours. Graphics maybe a bit dated but still nicer to look at than cyberpunk2077 and the cutscene battles epic should be made into a film. If you have not played this dont be like me get it now, choices you make really do have a major impact and the decisions are sometimes a very hard choice, its a game that makes you feel sad its all over at the end. This game sit at the top, along side the greats like Baldurs gate, Kotor, Mass Effect and Fallout. Its a shame the series list its way, but we wilk always have origons.. I haven’t finished this game yet, but from what I’ve played, it’s actually good? The graphics are a little off, but it has a nice story, but not-so-good gameplay.. Love to see a remake of the game with all the new tech we have available with current gen or even next gen :). This is easily the best RPG on the 360. The game play, graphics, and story are all amazing. Even tweaking the programming of your team mates is a whole tactical mini game in itself. The sequels never measured up. It seems they had to listen to all the butt hurt crybabies who didn’t like that it wasn’t an action game.. It is the finest RPG of its generation. The gameplay is fun and challenging. The plot is captivating and it is one of the few RPGs that actually successfully climaxes at the final battle or sequence of events.. 5 out of 5. Dragon Age: Origins is an excellent RPG from Bioware. The character you design decides your opening chapter (or “origin”), once complete will lead to the normal story. There are six origins to play through, my favorite was the Human Noble (as a Rogue). There is a lot of replay if you want to see everything, as you must pick a side for each quest. Combat is typical for a Bioware game, which is not a bad thing. A recommend if you liked Knight of the Old Republic.. This is one of the best games I've ever played. The characters and story are unforgettable. The playable origin stories really connect you to your character, which makes the story feel that much more important. The only areas where I felt like the game was lacking was in its outdated graphics (for the time it was released) and the lackluster combat. I know that some will argue that the combat was more tactical and is fitting of an RPG, but I really wasn't impressed with the auto-attack. All in all, I recommend this game 100%. Great story with very interesting and captivating characters - I just couldn't stop playing. Graphics not amazing, but alright. Very interactive game, one of the best I've ever played.. Once you get past the steep learning curve (if you're not used to the style of combat) you'll find a fascinating fantasy RPG that almost lives up to Mass Effect in terms of character interaction and world building. The 360 version looks pretty bad and other elements of the game make it feel older than 2009 but aside from those issues great characters and stories as well as hours of engaging in (semi) strategic fights, collecting items, exploring and conversing can be enjoyed.. Another amazing game from Bioware. Great RPG experience, very deep gameplay, great writing, fun and challenging hybrid combat, and mostly impressive graphics for its time. All of these plus more makes this one of the best RPGs i've played IMO.. Dragon Age Origins More like Goose Age Origins This game is deep, and that’s the greatest thing about it. The depth though is also the worst thing about it This game starts out with letting you customize your character and choosing your class. All of your choices here will determine the origins story you are given. There’s potentially 6 different stories to be told in this game… I played the console version of this game, so it’s much more action oriented than strategy based. You can journey with 4 allies at a time to help you fight enemies and you can gain new allies along your journey, How you treat your allies and the people in the world around you will determine if they turn their back on you or help you with your cause. Your allies do a fairly decent job at holding their own... they only got stuck one time in my entire playthrough. You can equip gear you find on them much like a JRPG, there is tons of micro managing your ally’s skills as well as yours, Dragon Age Origins is lengthy, but not lengthy because there is so much great content to experience... The game is long just for the sake of being long... it accomplishes nothing in dragging the story on forever and makes you do more than you should really have to… The entire game feels like one giant goose chase. After your origins story the map opens up and you can freely clear it in any order you choose, The incentive to doing so is there is a blight... demons… an army... you need allies, so you set out into the vast sections to gain those allies... Each section of the map could literally be their own game… and not necessarily in a good way. They all have their own self-contained stories that link to the overarching story, but every single one of them follow the formula of the main story, which is you think you’re done but you’re not you get to whoever you’re looking for but they need you to do this before they’ll help you but when you get there to do what they need there’s someone there that needs you to help them before they can help you help the person that you need to help before they’ll help you.. Its overwhelming and ultimately makes the game feel like it drags on forever and quite frankly it does... you never feel like you are making any true progress… It took me 10 hours of playing before the game got even a little bit interesting to me. There are some really cool sections to this game, again they all feel like they could be their own game... It’s crazy to look back when you’re near the end and think of the journey you’ve been on and how it was indeed part of this game and not some game you played years ago even though it feels like it. There’s mages, demons, going through the fade and shape shifting, hunting werewolves down in the forest, going underground to search for a mighty anvil There is so much to experience. While Dragon Age’s game world is vast and deep, I found the gameplay and journey to be shallow and tedious. Due to the delivery of the story, and the constant webbing of story lines I found Dragon Age Origins to eventually feel more like a chore than a game, After about 30 hours in I was begging for the game to be over, to get to the point, but instead it drug me down another 20 hours of rabbit holes. If the rabbit holes don’t make the game feel tedious enough, it also does a horrible job at quest progression in general... You rarely know where you’re supposed to go, The marker for the quest you’re on only appears when you’re close to the desired location… and by close, I mean practically on top of it… Which will lead you right to google to figure out where this person lives since who’s going to really memorize the locations of these people by name? I’m not There’s a Lot to do in Dragon Age Origins, so I can definitely see why people love this game so much… Even I appreciate the game for what it has going on... There was just ultimately nothing here to hook me in... If I didn’t feel obligated to make it to the credits, I definitely wouldn’t have I give Dragon Age Origins a 7.5/10. Story: 10 Characters: 10 Graphics: 9 Setting: 10 Multiplayer: N/A Technical: 5 Audio: 10 Gameplay: 7 Re-Playability Value: 10 Fun Factor: 9 Innovation: 8 Total: 9. From the Simple but, satisfying combat to the intriguing story, this one will keep you going for hours. The only trouble in this game is trying to please everyone.. It's a good game, nothing spectacular but still good and it's story is very well told, along with a good cast, amazing gameplay and really good character development. However the game itself is also lacking in some features such as a variety of extremely useless spells and talents, as well as some pointless side missions which really killed of the mood for me. I personally romanced morrigan as human Mage and romanced alistair as a dalish elf, they're both really well acted characters.. Despite the awful graphics, weird ""open world"" and a character on par with Jar Jar Binks, this RPG is still one of my favorites. Man, I STILL want to c*ckpunch Allister.... Pros: Good choices. Good back story for each race. Good story, not great. Good voice acting. Cons: Worst gameplay ever. Horrible graphics. Bad facial animations.. Alright, let's start with the good. The story is great and very interesting in all of the choices and different characters you can meet along the way. I liked how much detail they put into all of the lore of the entire world of Dragon Age. The graphics were alright, I mean they didn't look amazing, but still good. The music, to be honest I can't really think of any particular track that stood out to me. Now for the bad. Combat which takes up a lot of the game is horrible, I mean on PC it looks totally different and actually good! The console version got the short end of the stick when it comes to it. My character at times will just stop what he's doing and sprint in a random directions, this got very annoying. The quest markers on the mini map were pretty bad. They would be on the map... some of the time, but most of the time it's just looking for yourself and that kind of felt like I was just wasting my time. In the end I do recommend this game it can be enjoyable and look for about 20-30 hours of game play, since this game is pretty old you could probably get it for about 15-20 dollars, which is well worth the price.. Dragon Age:Origins is the worst game of all time. People seem to confuse dirt for diamonds in today's face paced world where information is gushing at your brain like a sewage pipe full of knowledge just burst. But honestly how can anyone find any sort of depth here? The dialogue that is so praised by critics is at best standard fair and nothing to the point it could convince me alone to buy the game, worst yet all bit of dialogue is spoken by weird alien looking people that look like they could past for CGI mannequins from a 90's film. The combat mechanics are pretty much like every other Bioware game and somehow seem even worse then what they were in KOTOR times, The characters are half assed archetypes I had no interest in knowing much less keeping alive, in fact half the time I wished I could feed Alistair to my dog, the Dog was more memorable then your companions. I can't even remember one line of dialogue from them and I just finished the damn game. The story is at best a slightly worse knock off Tolkein, it feels drab and uninspired. Any grand and memorable vistas? Any interesting areas? NOPE! The game generally keeps it's same, dark, depressing grimdark look through out the game making almost every environment feel the same. Also why is it the game even called Dragon Age? Why not Dark Spawn:Origins. The only damn dragon I saw in the game was slightly bigger then my character and easy as hell to kill. Wait a minute, why did I even play this worthless game? I might as well have gone and read Tolkeins books, I'd still get the same story minus the ****ty uninspired enviroments, the ripped off story elements, the horrid combat, the linear and pointless adventure that makes you feel like you really accomplished nothing but unite a bunch of fantasy stereotypes. In short the game is awful don't buy it.. Anyone that has played any of BioWare's other RPG titles, and Knights of the Old Republic in particular, will be instantly familiar with the way Dragon Age: Origins works. Having completed one of four unique origin stories the player sets about putting together a team and convincing different tribes to join them in the battle against an army of demons, known as The Blight, that are hell-bent on destroying the world. Along with the fantasy setting this plot could of course be considered a little clichéd but the detailed world, expansive history and interesting dialogue choices more than makes up for this. The gameplay itself is well paced with battles being played out in real time, although they can be paused at any time to allow for tactical decisions to be made. With so many spells and techniques available there is plenty of scope to customise your team just how you want meaning there is a great deal of depth to proceedings. All in all I found Origins to be a deep and thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish, and that’s saying something in a game that lasted over 50 hours.. A very story-driven game where it succeeded in delivering a good one. Although you could definitely tell it was made for the PC, the combat wasn't too bad. A little buggy. I was getting sick of my character running in random directions when I chose to attack something. When it came to looting, eventually your equipment just didn't get better. Also, the quest tracking in the game was simply awful. The constant waves of enemies got very repetitive soon. The game delivers when it comes to giving the player an abundance of choices that significantly impact the game and story.. This game is amazing anyone that enjoys RPG's should own this game, the story and writing is wonderful, there is so much to experience. I finished the game in 49 hours with only 61% Exploration so even though the world is linear there are a lot of areas to explore, the armor design and leveling system are extremely well thought out, you can make an extremely in depth character with branching skills and specialization's. The only down sides to this game is the combat system is not very in depth, and the graphics won't impress you but they have aged well. So all in all fans of the RPG genre will fall in love with this game, and any gamer worthy of the title must own this game.. A very good RPG. I don't like how Bioware makes its games for teen boys when it comes to women, sex and the dialogue in general. In DAO that stuff is sufficiently out of the way so that it doesn't get in the way of gaming. I'd rather have a world like that in Witcher instead of Bioware's classic good vs evil with large breasted women and huge spiky armors. Nevertheless, DAO was good. Definitely the best game Bioware has ever produced and looking at the horror that was Dragon's Age 2 and how they ""developed"" Mass Effect downhill through the series it is safe to say that DAO will be their best game ever.. A nearly perfect game, yet so unique in its own nostalgia, so charming in its characters, so tactical and past-gen in its combat, so humorous in its dialogue and so open in its narrative that it gets a 10 from me.. Ok to sum up dragon age origins in won word. Awesome! This is my second greatest RPG of all time right behind mass effect and one of the best games I've played of any genre. Pros: one of the best story's in a game ever, party members are interesting with some of the most memorable back story's, you will be a bit annoyed by the auto attack combat but is really more strategic then about doing mass damage to enemy's, hours of content, deep customization for yourself and your team, interesting choices, great epilogue where your choices come together and either change the world in a good way, messed up and blew up and your face, or devastate the world Cons: it may be a bit too hard I played through on easy just so I would not end up taking a hammer to my Xbox, fade quest, an extremely annoying bug I got where I was unable to have any conversation with leliana and get her quest and backstory, morrigans spell near the end I won't spoil it but it makes no sense on how it works or why that's the choice since chances are if you played as a girl it may end up killing you So listen to me and play this awesome game you will never feel like you are not getting every penny of the purchase price. Expectations: I had no expectations going into this game Scores: Graphics: 8/10 Campaign: 10/10 Sound: 8/10 Gameplay: 7/10 Multiplayer: N/A Final Score: 8.25/10 Final Verdict: Taking into consideration that this game came out in 2009 this games graphics are great a few bad spots here and there but apart from that they are excellent. The story in this game is great end of, the soundtrack in this game elevates this whole game to another level. I felt that the gameplay in this game could have been better but it's still good.. Yeah, so 4 apparently doesn't put this game in the red. Well, shucks. I gave Dragon Age 2 an 8, but since that review was basically just bashing this game, I figured I'd flesh out my bashing a little more. First of all, what did I like? The city elf origin story (I am told I would like the casteless dwarf story too), king Cailan, the dog--whom I named Yarlan--and, um, nothing else. Oh, I guess the conflict of interests at the landsmeet was pretty cool too. Oh, hell, I also liked queen Anora. There. Wait, one more, the drama of Isolde killing her own son was pretty gripping and, well, awesome. Everything else--Boring! Stupid! Ugly! A pain to listen to! I mean really--""My warden sense is tingling""? ""It's either you or me and it isn't going to be me""? C'mon! People bought this?! A generic the-world's-gonna-end plot involving ogres? I mean darkspawn--could've call them the Flood for all I care. That's what there is to offer? Did y'all really think the story was epic? Have you seen the map? There are only a handful of places to go to and the game can be beaten in 20 hours including the side quests. If it takes longer than that it is because hacking through every enemy--which you have to do to build experience since they don't respawn (places look like desolate wastelands when you revisit them)--is so damn tedious. Have you played an epic RPG lately? Diablo? Dragon Quest? Final Fantasy? Hmm? Does the game really give you that many options","i'm a big fan of KOTOR, so I'm not surprised it turned out to be my niche . amazing storytelling and really good character backstories . i am rating it higher than Inquisition because overall Origins is a better roleplaying experience ."
903.Steins;Gate Elite,"Fantastic sci-fi and time travel based story. One of the few games that touché me deeply.. I was looking into narrative novel games and came across Steins;Gate and saw hundreds of positive reviews raving about the amazing story and characters. I have now come away from finishing this game and have to wonder what everyone else played. First, this is not a narrative novel game. You don’t get to make choices (no the emails don’t count, or whether or not to send D-mail) and will spend most of the game, around 35 hours, clicking the ‘X’ button to go to the next line of dialogue. That’s all you do, is sit there and read it. (There are so many text screens that are just ‘…’) Why was this made as a video game? Indeed the first three chapters alone took 11 hours, without trying to rush through it, as I did with the rest of the game. This game screams that it had no idea what it wanted to be. We have science fiction with the ideas of time travel and all the science-y talk, a relationship thrown in at the last possible moment, and then all this Otaku-info dump (have you ever wanted to know the deepest levels of Japanese culture thrown up so that they needed to add an entire dictionary so you could kind of understand?). If it could have chosen one genre, the story could have been far stronger because the two halves of the game don’t really connect with each other. Much of the info dump at the beginning in regards to time travel and SERN don’t come up again once their device is operational. They also try to act like they’re butterfly effect without ever using the concept correctly, and often mock it and Groundhog Day when they decide to throw that in too. I got so frustrated by this drawn out process that I paused after chapter three and ended up getting ahold of the anime just to see if that was any better. The fact that they were able to cut out a lot of the endless prattle to make the story tighter, only showed how many useless hours were in this ‘game’. Not only that but I had absolutely nothing but disdain for the main character Okabe in the game. He doesn’t have any cares about what he’s doing and indeed actively tells complete strangers, just try our time machine, we don’t know what will happen! For most of the events, he doesn’t even know what the others are setting out to change! The anime made the characters more bearable and likeable as well. I didn’t want to completely strangle everyone. Technically, there are multiple endings here. I say this because most of them are based on not fixing the timeline and just allowing a certain character to die. Faris’s ending was probably the best as it made the most sense. Okabe was always the problem and this ending illustrated what taking him out of the equation would be like. The other two are letting one character live or the other, and then the final ending is saving them both. You will never be able to get two of the endings without a walkthrough because it involves choosing the correct email replies and collecting the correct amount of relationship flags for these. All of these endings were just whatever, because it just required you to suspend all intellectual thought as the writers continuously contradict themselves, sometimes in the same character conversation! Once you try to get these other endings are just fast-forwarding (beware when the D-mails options pop up because it will blast through those and not send the mail) the game is a whole 2 hours long! The best part about this 'game' was the soundtrack. They were such beautiful tracks that as I listen to them I'm immediately transported to moments that they took place during. Steins;Gate is not what the creators advertise and indeed, not what all the positive reviews make it out to be. If you must try this story, you should stick with the anime. That is the form this story was meant to take. I’m just so happy to finally be done.. It's the best visual novel I've ever played, I really like the story, the way the different endings are developed is incredible. No wonder it has such a good anime. Good story, but written more for young or novice readers. I won't go into the story details, as much of that would be considered spoilers. Though generally, it's a relatively unique conspiracy-themed time travel story with some basic romantic tangents. Several moments in the story are quite good or shocking. It's the plot that ties those moments together that's lacking. Yes, plenty of plot holes, unbelievable science, and a few unbelievable character actions make this a sloppy story. I say the story is for young or novice readers because everything is explained to you. The characters' inner thoughts and science are all written out to you in excruciating detail, so there's very little room for interpretation. Interpretation and vagueness are required for intelligent fiction; In addition to just being more real, it gives the reader the opportunity to analyze actions and characters based on what others see, giving them a sort of intellectual puzzle to piece together as more things are revealed. That doesn't happen here, but that alone doesn't make it bad. The plot holes, science issues, and dumb character actions are what bring the story down. I'd say about 80% of the science in the game is accurate, but the other 20% is so dumb that they should have just kept it hidden. You'll definitely have issues with some of the dumb science on display here if you're into physics or software coding at all. And the plot holes, while not huge, are distracting, especially when the game tries to explain them away. I imagine the writers thought that certain plot holes were so big that they had to have characters try to explain them away, on the fly. This was done poorly though, and again, these explanations should have been left unsaid. Dumb character actions are fortunately rare, and normally revolve around suicide or killing someone else. But at least due to the time travel mechanics, most of those are undone and it helps more intelligent readers forget that happened. Besides the game's storytelling, it has a few technical issues, such as videos cutting/jumping quickly, 2:3 video judder, and typos (a few repeated lines of text). They were annoying at first, but I got used to them eventually. Also, the game has a whole chapter and ending that is only shown if you send the right emails to certain people during your playthough. There's no indication given that this will happen, and I found out after the game was over that I had missed those (due to not getting to the last chapter). So you'll need a guide if you want to see the whole game as it gives you no clues on what to choose. So an interesting and decent enough story if you're into sci-fi time travel, but isn't intelligently written at all.. A game so excellent, I bought it twice. Actually, I only bought it for the download code for Steins;Gate: Linear Bounded Phenogram since I don't have a PC. But I still loved it & got that plat, here's my 10 to combat the negative reviews all the nostalgia-blind fanboys that didn't even play this gave. It's still a great story, even if some of the original lines aren't in this one.. Play original, not that crap. Thats really so so bad and @fully@(rofl) animated(no). One of the best in the Visual Novel genre. I think the most important question is how you look at this genre as a whole. If you absolutely detest reading or simply do not recognize the genre as ""video game"" then this is obviously not the game for you. This is a replay for me, because I've played the original on Vita a few years back. While knowing the plot this time around did put a damper on some of the surprises and twists, it was still very enjoyable. I have watched the anime as well but it felt like they added more original animated scenes? Maybe it's just been too long. If you like Time Traveling stories, especially ones that seems to be a bit more grounded in reality (as real as a time travel story goes), give this one a try.. Awesome game ! Really captured the feeling of the classic and the anime as well ! The best visual novel on the ps4 right now !","the first three chapters alone took 11 hours, without trying to rush through it, as I did with the rest of the game . the game screams that it had no idea what it wanted to be . the fact that they were able to cut out a lot of the endless prattle to make the story tighter, only showed how many useless hours were in this ‘game’ ."
904.The Sims 3,"The original game on the PC is great, the Wii versión is... Mediocre at best.. Best game in the series by far. The Sims 3 is a game I grew up playing all the time. Only downsides to this game is how poorly the game can run at some times and how the game can have a seizure if playing with too many packs.. It is the best game in the sims franchise so far!!! It is 1000 times better in every single way than it's successor, and IDK why it is rated less than sims 1 and 2.... The best of Sims. I spent too many hours in this game. If that doesn't make it worth a playthrough, I don't know what does.. This in my opinion is one of the best Sims games EA has ever produced. It has a ton of features that make it stand out such as a curfew for your teen sims, cars, and an open world with around 90 lots to explore. Did I not mention that this is all in the base game? The Sims 3 is the only Sims game with an open world which does have some downsides *cough* Island Paradise *cough* it makes the word more open not just by locations but by the Sims themselves. The Sims 3 introduces story progression, where the Sims (even the ones you create) do things by themselves. You can actually see this in the world which makes it feel way more open than another Sims game that I won't mention because you already know. There is also Create a Style where you can choose which texture, and color specifically you want your furniture to be. You can use it with really anything you want which is really cool. Gameplay is amazing you'd just have to see yourself. While the game is amazing there is some issues, such as lag and the game being corrupt. On some systems it may not run as well as on others so make sure to check. But overall, it's an amazing Sims game to play and enjoy and is definitely one of my favorites.. I've always liked it more than the fourth game, and I've played it more. Despite EA's horrible DLC policy, it still makes more sense to play this than the fourth game.. sims 3 is still my favorite sims out of all. the gameplay, mechanics, and art is so much more realistic.. Sims 3 with the major expansions is good for hundreds of hours of sim life. There's so much variety and so many potential stories in this game that its hard not to love.. Pretty good game about building your own house and family. I spend some time on building my home and enjoyed that :). A game iv played since 2013 and will likely keep playing for many years to come as EA likely wont ever make a better sims game, the sims 4 sure wasn't. Sure the game looks a bit outdated mainly the sims and shadows (wish we could get a remaster maybe theres a mod idk) and the game does run a bit slow at times tho this is mainly just on really large towns with a lot of objects and sims living in them, the sims 3 is also ""known for running poorly"" but for me its always ran just fine, there are a good few bugs that you'll come a cross from time to time such as pets turning into bat demons from hell but for the most part the bugs are harmless or easily fix able.. I remember spending my whole day as a kid playing this game, it was just so addictive and fun. The expansion packs actually brought a lot of content compared to the sims 4 today and the open world just makes the sims 3 much more superior to the sims 4. One negative thing that I remember would always happen was that the game would crash and I would lose all my progress.. probably the best sims game, although it can be very repetitive and monotonous. Good Superstar Awesome Score 90 Good Superstar Awesome Good Superstar Awesome. I am not very familiar with the Sims series. I have only played Sims 4 and it did not give me the best impressions. But after noticing how everyone praises the 3rd part and calls it the best part in the series, I decided to play it. And in general I liked her. For me, it is definitely better than 4 parts. It feels like they put their heart into this game. Nice music here. Also a very nicely done clothing editor. The longer you explore the world here, the more you will be amazed at the amazingness of this game. Also, this game has very cool additions. My favorite with vampires. The game is great and I advise you to play it.. sims 3 never miss. much better than the others, best sims game so far. sim creating could be little more wider tho.. The Sims series is one of the best known worldwide. After the great success of The Sims 1 and 2, The Sims 3 implemented significant graphics improvements, but it was no longer new. It is undoubtedly a game that guarantees hours of fun, but when I played it I had the feeling of being ""more of the same"". But I will give 10 stars!. It is a really fun game tbh, it is lagging now and has a lot of issues but overall it is a really fun game to play.. Very fun game. I liked either cheating and getting a very easy life, or trying to kill characters in a pool, or actually simulating real life.. The Best game in the world ! Fantastic absolutly fantastic game ! Thanks ea. The Sims 3. The simulator I spent the most of all. Right from the beginning, I was enchanted by the graphics, which again missed some of the piece compared to previous parts and the game looks much better. Not only does it look, but it is. You have even more options for creating a Sim, and this time you can really create it in the form of you, if you want. Luxury house construction. Lots of options, which are again part of DLC. What's great is the opportunity to go to town and overall the fact that you don't have to spend the whole game in your house is great. It's a shame that you don't explore that much, because as I mentioned, a lot of it should already be in the game, but it's not and you're forced to pay the DLC developers. For me, a good game that still improves the second, but repeats the same mistake and that is paid content. Once you have all the DLCs, hundreds of hours of content await you. But as soon as you play a classic game without any DLC, you will play up to a hundred and then you will find that you no longer have much to do in the game. For me, a good game that could have been great, but paid DLC knocks it all down. Nevertheless, I recommend The Sims 3.. Best Sims base game. You can buy buildings and become a tycoon. You can buy fancy cars. you can grow veggies in the garden and improve their quality in time. A challenging one would be to make ambrosia. Which requires 2 very rare ingredients: Death fish and Life plant, and a very expensive recipe. One your sim eats it, it resets their age and expend their life span. You can live forever. A landmark title of my childhood, The Sims 3 is one of the best games I've ever played, easily getting lost in the game and playing for hours, The Sims 3 is an extremely iconic game.. Sims 3 has such a strong base game and any expansion packs add so much to the game however there are many glitches but regardless more well rounded then the sims 4.. This game would be 10/10 if there wasn't so many bugs.. But i still appreciate open world, color wheel, gameplay and hoe you can express ypurseld just the way you want.. A big technological step forward compared to previous games. Spent many hours in it.. i remember playing this one all night long without my parents knowing about it. a really good game. still, the sims 2 wins over 3.. Im still playing it after many years, it has to be good. I recommend it to all girls :). The Sims 3 is a step in the right direction, and two steps back! The open world is innovative and the only thing that makes people go back to the game. The design creator is also very nice and needed in new entries in the franchise. Meanwhile, everything is broken, the loading times were and still are a nightmare, the NPCs turn into pudding people after a while. And everything is just coated in EA's paywall system, where most basic stuff is either added in expansion packs or must be bought through a separate shop for SimPoints. It could've been an amazing life simulator if it wasn't for EA.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of my favorites in the franchise. A must-play for everyone who wants a relaxing, time-consuming and fun life simulation videogame. This game is just awesome! How can someone hate a game like this?. The Sims 3 is easily the best installment of The Sims franchise. Even though it has lots of bugs and doesn't work that well on lower-end PCs, it's fun. DLCs are pretty good, adding lots of new options and objects. However, in 2020, most objects look outdated and not fashionable, which makes Custom Content needed to make perfect Sims.. [ ] Perfect [ ] Awesome [x] Good [ ] Good Bad [ ] Fail Não vejo necessidade em escrever um longo texto analisando uma arte, a nota é apenas um conselho para saber o quanto ela vale para sua vida. I see no need to write a long text analyzing an art, the note is just a piece of advice to know how much it is worth in your life.. Takes forever to load for no apparent reason, and unfortunately character customization really shows it's age here.. This game is buggy and worse than sims 2. It is garbage. There is no fun of playing real-life simulator when the game is so easy.... A really good game. Not as good as The Sims 2, but pretty alright though, I must admit.. The Sims 3 is hands down the strongest in the series. Big open world with so much to do. Sure on lower end PCs it's not the best running game but this sims game alone is a beast. Every Expansion makes the game so huge there's so much to explore and the stuff packs are some of the best. The game is buggy bug with the help of mods it's mostly fixable. It's to be expected with a game this huge and Sims being in real time. So many types of life states you can play as. From things to animals to ghosts, Vampires, Robots, Werewolves, Fairies, etc. (Based off owning all DLC) There's way too much with Sims 3 I poured 1000's of hours into it. It's just too perfect and offers so much. The Car driving, taxi riding, running to places, seeing your sim actually travel to places, etc. It's how a Sims game truly needs to be. Released in 2009 and yet has way too much to do that you end up being **** in to the world of Sims for countless hours. Many Careers to choose from and even controllable ones. So many traits to choose from even from base game. Amazing moodlet system that feels rewarding in every way and isn't too hard to deal with. Lifetime rewards to challenge yourself. Unlockable Lifetime wishes for rewarding yourself afterwards. A Create-A-Sim that'll keep you making Sims as you keep downloading more and more mods. A never ending ""Story Progression"" System. When you don't control your Sims they live on their own and can raise families, pass away, travel around, move, etc. It's like they actually can do things players do. And so much more. Sims 3 is the best game there is in the Franchise. No other Sims game can beat it with the amount of Open World and content this game has.. The first game I ever got addicted to. I still rarely will find myself coming back to this game. Only problem is the loading times and glitches.. The Sims 3 has become one of my favourite games; with its expansions (and even without them) your experience playing this game will be simply wonderful. I really highly recommend this game if you love simulation games.. Not very well optimized, but maybe the best game in its genre. Strategic, addicting, open world, tons of objects to build with.. The life simulator perfection at it's finest. I like every single bit of the game - the world, CAS (although I think that the Sims 4 CAS is better, because you can just pick a body part on your sim by your mouse, and change it, for ex. you can just get your mouse on your sims stomach and get it fatter or skinnier), the house creator, the furniture, the clothes, and many more. You don't even really need to get CC for your sims, but if you want to - go ahead. :D. I've spent more time on this game than any game that i've ever played. Even more than Rome Total War. This game was practically living through my teenage life! I'm too tired to write an extensive review so here are some positive and negative: + Indescribable replayability. + Amazing graphics for it time, especially for it genre. + Very innovative for it time too, if i'm not wrong, it was the 1st semi-open world life simulation game. + Fun Fun Fun! - Too buggy some times, especially in Isla Paradiso, you have to use MasterController and Overwatch Mod in order to play it smoothly. - Too many expansions, if you want a full experience like i do, you gotta pay a lot!. Sims 3 is amazing! It's an older game so the graphics aren't amazing, but the variety to control your sims is great! It's such a good game that the only thing the Sims 4 does better is graphics. Now, this game is one point away from 10 points. My reason for that is because as usual, it's another game EA released unfinished and sold the rest of it in like ten, two dollar DLC packs, which really makes it feel like your missing out but that's alright because the Sims 3 does just fine without them.. The Sims 3 is a good game I play it on steam it runs well on my 4 gb computer. and ending on the 7/5/2017 most games are on sale I got the game for 5 bucks and 2 expansion packs for 10 bucks. good game i love the music in similish and there load of mods and cc content ok thats the good the cons ea having it connect to orgin to boot the game up is annoying sims 3 is a ram hog sims 3 wont run on intell video card. Great open world, the only thing that is enjoyable here. But even that falls into crap due to forever loadings and constant lags. Lot's of bugs and glitches even on high end PCs. Not worth the full price at all. Maybe in future there will be a miracle and a PC that makes this game run properly.. 500 euros for all DLC you must be kidding....I regret I bought this ****'s painful seeing people wasting their money and I feel really bad for you **** your life back. A okay sims game for a low price....................................................................................................................... Not as good as the 1st and not to nostalgic but this game has the best and most useful expansion packs and the game is more addicting than sims 2 and 4. I love this game!. Consider this game is the best Life-Simulation to date. You start a life by get a job and receive those payment for upgrade house, buy new stuffs and pay bills, of course. This maybe my best Experience in the Sims 3, You find a partner and she get pregnant. then your new child born. the baby become a toddler. to me, children is not my best interest. but in the Sims 3, it a little different. when they grew up, they also retain the look from their parent, like hair color and face shape. However, the game has bad AI. Sims simply don't run, like when they late at work. they simply just walk and that can take more than 30 minutes in game, consider your house has long enough walkway. some of the AI is bad enough to make you became annoyed and may want to kill them on purpose. the game will start to get boring, especially without new contents soon.. The Sims 3 only appeals to a small audience and is a very slow paced and boring game to endure. In theory this this game sounds like it would pretty fun but when you get into it you dont have many things to do and i often find myself skipping through a big chunk of the day so i can do something later. I realize i am not exactly the right kind of gamer to enjoy this but it seems like only a child could enjoy. But this game does have some redeeming features such as the deep character customization and it was also kind of fun(and sometimes annoying) trying to multitask and fulfil my character's needs. Besides that this game is painfully boring and definitly worth a skip unless you a fan of this genre a games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The sims 3 stands out as the single best sims game ever created. The open world game style design is excellent as are it's customization features. Unfortunately this game requires a top of the line gaming pc to run at it's best and since it's an EA title good luck accessing the freaking servers to register your game and gain access to the player store! This game is one of the best things EA has ever done and as anyone with half a brain will tell you they have gone straight down hill ever since. If you have a high end PC then you should buy it right away but try to get it with all of the content packs during a sale so you can get the full experience for half or less of the ridiculously high price. I truly wish EA wasn't run by a bunch of simple minded greedy and cheap rejects. There could be so much done with a sims title if it were created by a competent game publisher. Pros: A large open world game system with lots to see and do. Lots of customization options that allow you to build your dream home. The size of your house is unrestricted and is limited only by your computer's limitations. There are some cool content packs and even a DLC island where you can start a luxury resort. If you can freaking access it the player store offers loads of unique custom items that you cannot get in game. Cons: It's an EA game and EA is run by incompetent pieces of **** so the sims 3 servers, The thing that a significant portion of the game's fun factor depends on. Can be impossible to access for some people for no reason and EA won't do a damn thing to fix it either. Because they're EA. And they only know how to be worthless greedy **** holes. The system requirements are higher than most any other game you can think of. This game eats memory like a fat kid eats cake. You need an expensive gaming pc with quality parts to run it at it's peak.. This is the best main Sims title that was made. The Sims 3 is very realistic and there's so much you can do with each Sim you control and that right there deserves every single credit it gets. Masterpiece!. OMG! Best Sims game ever! I liked the Sims Bustin Out and Sims 2 on consoles, but I didn't like how there wasn't a huge open world. Luckily, Sims 3 does full justice on that. It's a steal getting it for $19.99, with a very good expansion and the best stuff pack ever made. Highly recommended. Only downside is that trying to stop playing this game is like trying to stop doing a drug, so be careful!. The possibilities are endless in this AMAZING game. It's one of those games that you play almost non-stop for about a month, leave for a few months and then repeat over and over again. The Sims 4 doesn't even hold a candle to the greatness of Sims 3. Sims 3 is an amazing game, that is very life like. I am looking forward to getting the new Expansion Packs. The amount of content is great. it feels like real simulation not the garbage what sims 4 is. the open world should be in all sims games.. The Sims 3 is a really fun game, in my opinion its better then the Sims 4. It always had a special place in my heart. The only i really dislike about the game is that you have to buy expansion packs to get more which is annoying. Its so much better than Sims 4, and offers the etiquette **** simulation game. Fun, addictive, many options and more options than Sims 4 gives more freedom possibilities than ever before. Nevertheless, its great and the best Sims game to date.. Hard to believe there are only 85 negative reviews. I have a top of the line gaming system running win 8.1 and an older duo core system running win vista. Nothing but script errors, random game crashes, bugs, glitches, freezes, corrupted game saves, performance issues, you name it - THIS GAME HAS IT ALL... I'd expect this from a $10 Beta Steam game, not from a known company such as EA. Very poor programming and patch maintenance. My daughter was so excited to get the PC version of this game, I spend more time ""fixing the game"" than she does playing it. Very poor support and programming, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...bottom line.. The Sims 3 is the best life simulator out there so far. I have gotten personally so much enjoyment out of the game. But Maxis made way to many expansions for this game. The Sims really displays emotion and feeling that I have never seen in a game before. The load time is WAY TOO LONG. I would recommend this game but I would be cautious about buying any expansions because they often lead to longer load times.. As a player sometimes i want to play a game without limits. I look through my old games and try to decide which one can satisfy my open world hunger. And at the end i always embrace my Sims games as a savior. Sims 3 is a very good game with expansions. In spite of many serious bugs and long loading times, game world is relaxing and beautiful. Gameplay is deep and diverse. Challenge is optional and creation tools are great. This is the last maxis game which respects hardcore and casual players equally. But Sims 3 is very expansive toy and without expansion packs content is limited and repetitive. If you have money and patience to ignore serious bugs, game is worth buying.. A beautiful open-world game that can be replayed over and over again. Create-a-Sim is fun and living out a life as yourself (or someone made up) is totally amazing. I never managed to bother with many of the expansion packs simply because they were overpriced and looked dull but the base game was fun enough.. All is fine, but not a lot of cheap additions - is a big negative. A good and a good life simulator. But, really, really a lot of extras that, if we take everything to pull out of the bag 10 times more than the base game The Sims 3.. If you like controlling people and picking their every action, this game is your game. However if you get bored with the Vanilla/Base, many expansion packs are there to rescue the day! Or waste your money... But overall, the game is very enjoyable.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is my go-to game when I have a new book to listen to, but I treat it as a building endeavor over the family thing. The sims are neat. The humor is an eyeroll. Example: the husband of my famous writer dies (from eating a bad jelly bean) and the grim reaper pulls out a smartphone to snap her picture before leaving with his ghost. It's cute in a not obnoxious kind of way. The creative variety available here is bare none. Sims 3 includes a feature called ""create a style"". You can basically micromanage the design of any object in the game be it clothing, a microwave, or the siding on a house. The personalization and variety to the personal landscape here is thus endless and remains interesting. CONS: -system resource guzzler -will overheat a weak laptop -still buggy with no autosave **** you must remember to save every hour -the sims themselves get old -do NOT try to get buy with a below recommendations system, sims 3 is a ""heavy"" game -ability to customize towns much outside of create a world just isn't there -ability to add new lots to an existing town is extremely hampered PROS- -building a house -creating outfits -Create-A-World -create a style (redesign any object in game to customize its look) -edit town allows you to save your family and/or lot and insert it in a new town if you become bored with your old one -players can design clothes, hair, houses, etc and provide them for **** free! It's great to have this endless outlet for new things in your game -exploring your town can be fun I tend to build, and just set queues on my families. I love create-a-world. I love testing my worlds. I have a tendency to work a family until the cash is enough to build the perfect, from scratch, house and then stop playing for months. That said, I've never encountered a ""building"" game I like more than Sims 3. Audiobook always playing though :) Like I said, it's just good, solid fodder for your idle hands while reading a book.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing game with lively characters and lots of places to go and things to do! Watch your characters transform into a virtual character as you control them to either go to a friend's and throw a party, or take a dip in the public pool. If you loved the Sims 2, this is the game for you!. I've been playing sims 3 since 2009. And no matter how many games I play, if I stay away from my sim families too long I miss them. So I generally play for at least1 hour a week, much more in between waiting for other games to be released. Sims 3 is really worth playing especially with all expansions. It's still one of my all time favourite games. A game that has brought me endless fun and sometimes frustration, even when I have a lengthy break, it is a game I always return to. It is not a game without problems, it suffered from being buggy and sims getting stuck and going missing leaving me with game breaking error codes, my game became unplayable until thankfully player mods fixed the game when EA couldn't or wouldn't. Love the open world and that everything is customisable, you can build almost anything you can imagine in endless colours and styles, and make everything however you want, you can have a crazy green faced witch with a massive nose obsessed with making everything covered in a tartan pattern, the stories and scenarios you can have for your family is endless and only limited by your imagination.. i have the sims 3 from sunset valley to isla paradiso and i want to say that this game rocks! i have many story, many supernatural story, many job story, affair story, many town setting story. the music is great, listening sims music doesn't make you dork at all. i want to recommended this game for people who wants to know who they are: why they are born in this world? what kind music they prefer? what lifetime wish they want? what jobs suit them best? what trait are you?how to befriend someone? how to flirt your partner? how to get promotion? etc. Surely you can not copy what you do on game to real world, there is always different of course but this game is like surface guiding and i love this game.. Aaaaah, I remember hours and hours and hours(!!!) of playing this game. Sometimes I was the happiest person on the world, sometimes the saddest one when my sim died. I highly recommend buying TS3 in sales with some expansion packs which will cost a lot because they are as expensive as the game by itself, but still. Yes, the game has bugs... LOTS of bugs, but they usually show when your computer is weaker or you have like ten generations of one family. Anyway, enjoy playing, it's great!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Sims 3 is awful. It looked very promising, but it failed to deliver. The open world was a great idea, but it failed hard. The world was really dead, there was almost zero Sims in the community lots, doing nothing besides stand there. The Sims looked are very robotic, the animations are very repetitive and exaggerated. Sims keep stopping when they're walking, they stop when they walk through doors, it's terrible. Routing system was lame. Teleport into the car was ridiculous. The Sims 3 lacks life. Everything is so dead and robotic. CAS is ok, Create a Style was great, Build/Buy modes were ok too. But the gameplay wasn't fun at all. The Sims 2 was much more dynamic. The expansion packs helped TS3 a lot, but the base game was just unplayable.. I didn't play The Sims 3 when it came out in 2009 because I was still on the curve of The Sims 2, plus I wasn't convinced it could surpass its predecessor. However, after playing, this game exceeded my expectations. We can find lots of new features, especially the open world and create-a-style, a more complex gameplay and the best visuals of the series. I guess the main complaints I have are the glitches, the rabbit holes and the need to have a good computer, plus the animation is too slow paced and recycled from the last base game. Other than that, great improvement. I don't think it's better than The Sims 2, maybe as good, but it's a very decent follow up **** franchise.. I'm a fan of tycoon games, but not a big fan of EA's ""Sims"" franchise. It's fun for a while. Creating people and directing their everyday lives is enjoyable for an hour or two, but when that's all you do, it becomes tedious at best. It's not great, and it's not terrible, it just is. If you liked the ""Sims 2"", no doubt you will like this latest installment. If you're not a fan of EA's franchise, you need not apply.. The Sims 3 Is the best simulation around, and this new addition takes the Sims to a whole new level. A walk able city with plenty of activities to endure. Although its lacking in content and some bugs the game is relaying heavily on the expensive expansion packs. All in all the Sims needs no introduction and I believe this installment takes the series to a whole new level. Can't wait for more, EA you surprised me.. I should not enjoy this game this much, I should not have sunk 300 hours into it, I should not have recreated my best friends, but I have, ad I keep going back. I don't like the philosophy of holding back a lot of features for dlc, but I can forgive it. The modding community made this even more special, especially nraas.. It's a good concept but the game felt dated, and most of The Sims 3 content you have to pay extra for so unless your willing to invest at least $60 this game feels very incomplete and lacking on content. Although Sims 3 doesn't live up to my expectations I will get The Sims 4 when it comes out later this year that way I can get the expansions as they come out.. A near-perfect masterpiece. It immerses you so deep into your ""Sims"" that it ruins your life until you decide to have a boyfriend or a girlfriend. The save system was not as good as the rest of the goodies., though.. Any positive qualities of this game are completely nullified by the sheer layout of the game. The Sims creators have always been a little friendly with putting out ""expansions"", but with The Sims, your entire experience is modular. When you buy The Sims 3 you're essentially just purchasing the bare-bones engine, and everything else is either an expansion or an in-app purchase featuring in-game currency (Simoleons) which you can purchase using real money and then use to purchase in game items. Everything you want to play in The Sims 3 is something you're going to have to buy piecemeal, and we've put up with it for a long time because we wanted the game we loved. Sometimes I feel the game we loved is still in there, but if you want it, you're going to have to pay a much higher price tag than what's actually advertised.. I thought EA will made a very great breakthrough in the series, but I was very disappointed knowing that this version is very heavy and expensive. The graphics are great, but the experience become **** when it comes after one hour of gaming. I still prefer Sims 2 than this one.. One of the best games out there using just the simplest ideas: Create characters and control their life. The Sims series is amazing and number three is by far the best so far that i have played. The art/create style tool adds a whole new customization aspect to the game, its amazing. You can take any object (except fences and stairs) and make it look like almost any material you can think of and have any color in the entire color spectrum. The new opportunities system is a great addition and the lifetime rewards are awesome!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Although not entirely realistic, there are many aspects of the game that make it enjoyable for many users. Apart from the occasional ""woohoo"", ""try for a baby"" and ""kiss/make out"" options on the game, I would suggest that it is suitable for fairly young viewers, and that the 12+ limit that is inflicted in the UK is well suited to the content of the game! Looking at the range of opinions of this game, I think it depends on yourself for whether or not you personally enjoy the game, and having been out for a while, the prices are more aff","the sims 3 is 1000 times better in every single way than sims 1 and 2 . it has a ton of features that make it stand out such as a curfew for your teen sims, cars, and an open world with around 90 lots to explore . gameplay is amazing you'd just have to see yourself ."
905.Freedom Force vs The 3rd Reich,"This is exactly what i wanted the sequel to be; more of the same. If you liked Freedom Force odds are your going to love this game. The reason i gave this a 9 instead of 10 is that it gave me the feeling you have when you watch a movie the second time around its still a great show but those high and lows emotionally you got the first time watching it is not the same.. Loved the original. **** even close. Lots of cool new powers, but the same villains over and over. How many times can you fight Fortissimo and Red Sun? Everything that was cool about FF was overdone, yet flat, in the sequel. Plus the storyline was just awful. The original was pure cheese, the kind that rocks, but this is pure limburger. There's a reason why no more sequels were made, as this game killed the franchise. Shame. Cool new powers and more characters are not enough to carry a lame story (and the writing was awful), and uninteresting foes.. I just played the demo, and unfortunately will not be purchasing this title. I have loved super heroes and comic books since my youth and this only seems to be a mockery of the genre. These Romanesque soldiers come running out of no-wheres and the interface is awful. It would have been great to see the story unfold but i just could not get used to it enough to stomach the duration=P","john sutter: this is exactly what i wanted the sequel to be; more of the same . sutter: everything that was cool about FF was overdone, yet flat, in the sequel . he says the storyline was just awful and the original was pure cheese . sutter: i will not be purchasing this title as i love super heroes and comic books ."
906.Fluidity,"Neat little physics based game. I hope this gets a sequel or something on Switch.. Such a great game with ingenious mechanics and fun puzzles. The progression and secret areas that you wonder what will unlock keep you into the fun of the game. But it can be frustrating at times and a bit repetitive at times too, but that is a very small gripe. If you still have a Wii, I’d still recommend picking it up... it is such a fun time.. An ingenious way to play with water. Once you start getting more and more powers, the game opens up so much more. Some of the controls later on get a little irritating at times (the only reason I didn't give a perfect score), but for the most part they're great. A fun game for kids, and enough of a challenge for the kids at heart, especially if trying to get all the rainbow bits, puzzle pieces, and flowers! A must-have for puzzle fans. Eagerly awaiting a sequel!. Along with the Bit Trip series, this is the best game on Wiiware. It's a great little gem with creative ideas, a cutesy art style and some very good puzzles. An unsung hero on Wii.. Who would have thought to create a game where water is the protagonist? Well someone did and created one of the shining diamonds to be found in Nintendo's Wii Ware service on Wii. The main character is versatile and depends on your control to maneuver through enjoyable puzzles within every room you visit. It may start of simple but the challenge picks on rather quickly.. Fluidity is a game I could play all day. Realistic physics and cool techniques (such as holding in water pressure to make it explode to defeat nearby baddies) is neat. The way this is present is prime.. One of the best original WiiWare games to come out, this game is definitely worth the small amount of money it costs. Graphics 9/10: Solid, not spectacular, but no complaints Sound 8/10: Happy music but not brilliant, good FX Gameplay 10/10: this game is really fun. It feels challenging but never too challenging, and the pacing is just right.. Fluidity is one of my games of the year for 2010, and probably 2011 as well! The controls are superb - the Wii remote lends itself awesomely to the experience of moving water around by tilting the world, and whilst things get tricky when you start opening up the 4 massive levels and changing state, the experience never becomes frustrating. Some of the abilities require some real thought, and the nod to games like Metroid and Mario are obvious with the option to go back and replay sections with new states, and open up new areas and challenges. The art is beautifully realised, with a bright and colourful, yet not childish, cartoon style. Visually the game is never bland and each level offers new environments to explore. An extremely worthwhile buy for 1200 points, and right up there with some of the other big hitters of the year. Great game.. This game is outstanding! The controls are great, and once you learn how to flick the remote, you get such precision its fantastic! Zooming about as Ice and smashing through walls! Exploding water over obstacles, Zapping evil goop with lightning! I love it! There's some amazing mini games built into the levels too! Pinball, helping a little action hero, even controlling a fire engine and a monorail! Truly a superb game! I'll be playing this all over Christmas! Totally under priced at 1200 WiiWare points too! This should have been a Disc game!!. Recently, Nintendo released a handful of free WiiWare demos of various games, so I gave a few of them a try. Wow, this game has me smiling from ear-to-ear the entire time. It's one of those puzzle games that takes good advantage of the WiiMote's motion sensing ability. In the game, you act as a puddle/pool of water that must navigate perils such as sand and hot lava and goop ""fire"" slugs. But as you progress thru the levels you obtain special abilities that allow you to pool yourself, or turn into a brick of ice to get thru tricky areas. The physics of the game is really fun, if only slightly un-realistic. But it's a game, not a physics simulation, right? Anyway, it costs 1200 wii credits and is a veritable bargain considering how fun it is.","fluidity is a great game with ingenious mechanics and fun puzzles . the controls later on get a little irritating at times, but for the most part they're great . one of the best original WiiWare games to come out ."
907.Destiny 2: The Witch Queen,"It was extremely overrated. It was a good campaign but not as good as Forsaken or final shape a good 3rd raid was incredible top 3 easily crafting was a bad idea and the seasons were mid-as hell. *The Witch Queen* is one of the most acclaimed expansions for *Destiny 2*, taking players into a battle against Savathûn, the Witch Queen, who has stolen the Light and is using it to create a Lucent Hive army. The storyline is one of the most intricate and well-crafted in the series, with a rich, twist-filled narrative that dives deeper into *Destiny*’s mythology. The campaign has been widely praised for its cinematic approach and for missions that are more varied and challenging than those in previous **** expansion introduces a new explorable area: Savathûn’s Throne World, an eerie, labyrinthine environment that perfectly reflects the manipulative essence of the Witch Queen. The Throne World is filled with secrets, puzzles, and activities, boasting a complex design that encourages players to explore and uncover the many mysteries hidden within this twisted dimension.A major addition in *The Witch Queen* is the weapon crafting system, allowing players to forge and customize weapons according to their preferences, adding new depth to customization and progression. The Glaive, a new melee/ranged hybrid weapon type, adds diversity to combat, offering a unique gameplay experience that combines close and ranged attacks in a novel **** expansion also includes a new raid, *Vow of the Disciple*, set within the Throne World, praised for its unique design, intricate mechanics, and challenging bosses. This raid demands high coordination and skill, providing a rewarding endgame challenge for veteran **** essence, *The Witch Queen* brings a compelling, narratively rich chapter to *Destiny 2*, with innovative features, a captivating new area, and challenging endgame content that solidify its place as a high point in the series.. Very fun legendary campaign both solo and co-op, and so is post-campaign quests like the Parasite one. New strikes are good, raid is entertaining. Glaives are great and got their place in the game. Crafting is now a thing.. I genuinely do not understand how after 8 years, Bungie still hasn't implemented basic user friendliness features into the game. They have monetized every aspect about it imaginable, but accidental dismantling? Oh, a button was pressed for an entire second on the wrong item on accident? Gone forever. Weeks worth of progress deleted in an actual second. Want to re-customize your Guardian? Nah, delete em and all of their quest progress and make a new one. Want to avoid feeling miserable as you're forced into playlists you don't like purely because if you don't get the rewards, you'll be left behind? Tough. Suffer. And no, the campaign in Witch Queen is not good. Have the people positively reviewing this one actually played any good games in their lifetimes? It's pretty, but literally all that happens is ""Hive get ghosts"" and you already knew that going into it. Everything else in the campaign is just one big lore dump, cool for hardcore enthusiasts, but for people just looking to have a good time, it is mind-numbingly boring. Legendary difficulty is a joke with how insane the power creep has gotten, and the only form of challenge Bungie can muster together is artificially inflating enemy health and damage. The negatives don't even end there. With old content being regularly deleted with no signs of ever returning and seasonal stories taking the forefront, anyone just now getting into the game or returning after a hiatus will NEVER be able to experience the story they missed firsthand. Much the opposite, you're just thrown into current events and the game pretends like you've been there all along, only providing a brief synopsis of what happened in a little circle in the corner of your map. This is, perhaps, some of the worst methods of storytelling I've ever experienced, and the cost of staying up to date is substantial - Bungie even SELLS you DELETED CONTENT just to access whatever leftover scraps that remain in the game. Please, avoid this game like the plague. It's fun and addictive at face value, but there are so many other games that are also fun and addictive, but actually respect you as a human being.. I bought this game because the Witch Queen expansion got good reviews. I found the expansion entertaining up until the final quest. That one stopped me for several days. The combat part is trivial, but the agility it demands was extremely taxing. Finally, after dozens of tries, I made it to the end of that gauntlet. To make sure my game would be saved, I finished the next objective and then logged when I saw another new objective. Upon returning to the game, I found myself back at the BEGINNING of the gauntlet. All my hard work was forfeit because I needed a rest and some breakfast. IMO, this is TERRIBLE game design. I won't be back!. Bungie is one of the greediest game developers existing in 2022. Destiny 2 is widely considered the watered down ""lite"" version of what the playerbase considered Destiny 1 to be. The majority of content has been ""vaulted"" meaning Bungie is too lazy to maintain the content its put out so it completely removes content you've already paid for from the game at regular intervals for the sake of ""keeping things fresh"". And on top of that, they now exclusively use a pay-to-win Season Pass/Battle Pass system to bait players into paying them more money for little to no new content. Would not recommend any game from this greed-riddled company to my worst enemy.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It had violence and guns. It’s on pc. It’s really awesome I love it. It’s on pc. EDIT: NOT FOR KIDS!!!! RATED T FOR TEEN!!!! STAY AWAY NINTENDO BABIES!!!!. Long time no see a good Dlc on destiny. But witch queen show us that even in bad times things can change. And for better. Masterpiece. Main storyline is awesome Sidequest are great And everything left is fantastic. Bungie has knocked this one out of the park. Incredible campaign, large and content-packed new region to explore, weapon crafting is decently designed and implemented. Raid is a step up from last expansion's raid. Definitely worth the purchase price. Its a good campaign but seriously this mechanic is dumb and is needs to be balanced better. Its no secret that bungie has struggled with balancing way to much in Destiny 2. Constantly removing stuff from the game until they can be bothered to fix it. Buffing stuff to a point past ""Obviously to powerful"" but now enemies have ghost which respawn them with full health. Which yh would be fine if they didn't take 20 minutes to kill and then stick to all the other enemies like glue so you can't kill there ghost within 10 seconds. Maybe they should slowly start pushing towards you at low health so then you can actually kill there ghost. Or maybe they shouldn't spawn with a full health bar. These are just obvious things that should be kind of obvious. The campaign isn't bad but like all Destiny campaigns, you either need to play every single 1 to fully understand the story or watch a ton of YouTube videos. I think Bungie need to work on making the game easier for new people to get into. Plus work on there story telling abilities and make each campaign easy to understand if you didn't play previous ones. Like I don't need to complete Halo Combat evolved to understand what was going on in Halo 2? The worst part is several of the campaigns have been removed from the game? Why didn't you just add an option to download or remove campaigns so you could still play them if you wanted to?. Hypocrisy of Bungie in harming russian players because of Ukraine situation. Games are not involved in politics!. Best Destiny Campaign yet. Delivers on all the built up suspense over the last year and finally introduces the big bad of the series. The raid is beautiful!. Really tedious and boring ... The Legendary kicks up the challenge Bungie style, but simply boring ... A lot of challenge, but very little fun. Also, solo players, avoid this like the plague.. You must play this game. This expansion is The Best Destiny 2 DLC ever. This one is same as or better than Forsaken. Wow, Bungie. You are screwing my life again. Thank you. The its just amazingly good one of the best Dlc since forsaken story is engaging and fun and i cant wait for the raid ... the new Weapon'sand exotic are amazing i cant wait int store for us. The best expansion we've had in Destiny's entire history - I'm honestly amazed. The last two expansions were lackluster, but the environments here are gorgeous and inspired, the campaign actually feels like a campaign and not a series of fetch quests or patrol zone grinds, the story seems to be approaching a critical moment, and the gameplay changes, new weapons, weapon crafting, and void 3.0 are absolutely amazing. I can't remember the last time I saw the Destiny community united like this in universal praise (we love to complain about things).. Really a definitive campaign for the game, i was really worried when Bungie say that, a wonderful and astonishing narrative and gameplay that in 7 years in this game, i never felt before. The craft system, as always new, is a little annoying because you can acess and do everything you want, but that's the way it is, you have to conquer everything. The exotics is finally powerfull and interesting, the destination are beautiful and fun to play. Good job, Bungo!. An emotional and amazing start and end to a story I've wanted to experience! Absolutely amazing. Though there are minor quirks, I believe bungie has started ironing things out. So far I would give this an 9.8. Every destiny player has to play this!. It pains me to admit it, but Bungie actually made Destiny fun again. Legendary campaign - very well done. Edit - new raid is trash.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best Destiny 2 Expansion ever. Witch Queen's campaign is one of the most incredible user experience in destiny history. Insane soundtrack and open world design. Congratulations, Bungie. You guys did it.. Another typical destiny 2 expansion, drip feed of content and aggressive yet confusing monetization. The content you paid for are temporary and will be removed in the next releases. Your gears and progress will occasionally get reset and again and again your time and investments are not respected. If you didn't like destiny 2 before or left for a reason, this expansion wouldn't change that. Story is better than many other expansions, but average comparing to other titles. But to be honest, nobody really play Destiny for its stories.. One of the best expansions to date, this is an absolute refresh after a long time period off.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best Campaign in all of the Destiny Universe. This is a turning point for Bungie, with the new crafting system and the throne world you can get lost in this universe, while feeling rewarded. Destiny at it best, if you are a fan of the franchise, this is a must play!. Great game, havent finished it but it looks amazing. The hive with powers is a great addition to the game. Just finished it, great campaign, great story and the final boss... I came. Great final boss.. Overall great campaign, this is the best destiny has ever been hands down and I hope this is the new standard.. I quit destiny after Beyond Light because of how painfully average it was. My friend ended up peer pressuring me into buying Witch Queen and I must say. The story in the Witch Queen rivals that of Halo Reach from 2010. I haven't seen story telling like this from Bungie in ANY OTHER destiny expansion. It blows the Taken King and Forsaken stories out of the water. The missions and side content is also FINALLY not a total drag. Everything you do has meaning and is engaging in some way.. Clearly Destiny's best campaign, even better than The Taken King. It shows the love and dedication that Bungie has put, Destiny fans are more hyped than ever.. The best campaign Destiny has ever had. Weapon crafting is fun and there is so much post game content to unlock. The new subclass and orbs of light changes are a refreshing change for build crafting. Cant wait for the raid!. Absolutely amazing content . Feels short but when you consider the additional content besides the campaign it's really not. Crafting is well introduced, and easy to understand. A welcomed feature. It forces you to try out new guns which was the objective and not just stick to one. Additional dungeons have a raid feel to them and are longer and satisfying. All in all great new fresh content . Long live destiny. Destiny has had its' fair share of glory and disappointment. Over 2,000 hours of Destiny 2 gameplay, it has become quite difficult for the game to maintain my attention. That being said, The Witch Queen held every bit of my attention. From the beautiful set-pieces, to the fluidity of the gameplay mechanics; Destiny 2: The Witch Queen sets an entirely new standard for the game and its' future content. I took quite a time off of Destiny 2 during the last season, and actually did not intend on getting into the game again. Sure enough, Bungie did it. They recreated the joy I felt during my first ever play through. Great Job. Great Game. See for yourself.. This is the first destiny 2 expansion I would recommend to everyone that likes narrative shooters, for the first time the campaign is not only challenging but has a good narrative and flashed out antagonist. The new glaives and crafting sistems are amazing and there is ton of content. -1 point because deleting paid content still **** and I hope Bungie stops. I didn’t think Taken King could ever be topped…but Bungie have done it. And the raid isn’t even out yet!. This expansion solidifies the massive step-up in the narrative, which bungie has been doing ever since the launch of Beyond Light. Rivaling even the long-loved The Taken King in storytelling and gameplay, The Witch Queen takes everything to the next level, by making a lot of choice into the hands of the players. It continues the changes to the elemental subclasses, with Void 3.0 launching alongside the release. This adds the same treatment to Void for all classes, as Stasis has been having since its release over a year ago in Beyond Light. Every team at Bungie has knocked this one out of the park, with extremely beautiful visuals, perfectly fitting soundtracks and effects, as well as a well-written story with a lot of secrets to uncover. Even the secondary background lore to the main story, carries secrets about the game universe itself, which people have been wanting answers to for years. If you were disappointed by Beyond Light with the ""sunsetting"", I can assure you that you won't even feel it ever took place. There is a lot to do for everyone, and a lot of choices on what and how to play. By far my favourite expansion in a long time, even coming off of the back of FF14 Endwalker a few months ago. Highly recommend this masterpiece of narrative twists and revelations long awaited.. Solid expansion with the addition of crafting and legendary campaign. There is a overwhelming amount of things to kill and craft. By far the best expansion that destiny has released and we are only a week in. 10/10. IMO This is the best story telling Bungie has ever done. The legendary campaign was both challenging and rewarding. I had a blast doing the whole thing with a 3 man fire team. 10/10 would recommend.. I've been playing Destiny since 2014 and have spent many hours in Destiny 2, but what Bungie has come up with here is really very well done. The best story in the Destiny universe. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best campaigns I’ve played. The campaign is 8 hours of pure story content with no filler at all. The story is put together amazingly. The weapon crafting system is also any other addition that makes the game even better, allowing you to customise your own weapons with rolls of your choice. And not to mention all the side missions + seasonal content.. They new systems and underlying changes to the fundamental gameplay ruined the expansion for me. Players shouldn’t expect such micro-managing changes that stranglehold choices in this game. Charged with light and orb generation ruined my experience. Player investment into armor and mods was completely invalidated.. This is Destiny at its best, the most transformative expansion this franchise has ever received far exceeding my already high expectations as a player who has been with this franchise since the very beginning, just the campaign alone is worth the asking price, do yourself a favor and play it on legendary, it is an absolute blast with some of the best storytelling I've ever experienced in gaming, Destiny is going places and I highly encourage you to hop on for the ride.. Legendary campaign is fantastic. Great story. New world is immersive, great graphics.. Best Destiny campaign yet. Rivals stuff like Doom Eternal. Also insane Soundtrack and nice reveal at the end with megamind. The best campaign experience in destiny history, legendary difficulty really allows you to feel the steaks of the story, the expanse and storytelling is massive and is a must play for anyone new or returning players.. Fantastic dlc, bungie is back in form with there strong campaign design and story telling with some rich content to be explored. Keep it up bungie. This is the direction destiny needs to go and you have the player base on board. This is an amazing game, the new witch queen campaign is jacked and the new legendary campaign is great for hardcore players like me. I am amazed by the way they have picked up weapons and brought them back from the dead. PVP is a much better experience now that op weapons have been nerfed though the last word remains. Pvp is going to get much better now that Bungie is giving PVP some love. I can trust Bungie they have always lived up to the hype in recent times and have never fallen back on a promise, ever since the darkness of Activision destiny 2 has expanded and embraced the MMO RPG genre. now weapon crafting is so smooth and balanced it's amazing. good job Bungie. That was best narrative destiny experience for me. Thank you, Bungie. I hope that will be a new destiny era","*The Witch Queen* is one of the most acclaimed expansions for *Destiny 2*, taking players into a battle against Savathûn, the Witch Queen . the campaign has been widely praised for its cinematic approach and for missions that are more varied and challenging than those in previous expansions ."
