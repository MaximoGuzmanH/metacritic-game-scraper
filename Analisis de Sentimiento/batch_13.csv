532.Mario Kart 8,"amazing game, really ahead of it's time. hard to top my favorite game of all time (mkw) but this was very close.. Nearly flawless. however the battle mode, and the somewhat rushed feeling of the game bring it down by a notch.. Good game. Just i was waiting more fun than Double Dash but i feel Double Dash is the best Mario Kart on my opinion. Obviously Mario kart 8 deluxe is better but it's original release is still pretty good. However, battle mode in this game is awful. I mean, battle mode in Mario kart has been bad since Wii, but at least Wii and 7 had good battle tracks, but in this, all the battle tracks are awful. It's just 8 tracks picked form the main game. THEY AREN'T BATTLE TRACKS! Also it **** that you can only hold 1 item at a time. The main game though, is good old Mario kart with an anti gravity twist. 7.5/10.. NOW, this is a game you do not want to miss. You can play it really well, and it has a variety of control schemes such as the Wii Wheel, the WiiU Gamepad, and even the Wii Classic Controller! Even when people say that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is better, I'm gonna give Deluxe the same rating because (a) that's all I can do and (b) it doesn't really innovate the series in a way.. Mario Kart 8 is the best looking version of the series to date. With high definition graphics, a lot more features than before and downloadable content, there is little to argue about. However, not everything is as good as some players would like. While the traditional racing modes remain intact, the battle mode is no longer as it was previously. It has now been forced into the current assortment of tracks, no longer existing in cleverly designed structures that make combat fun. It is sad to say, but an added feature that created hours of fun off the track in the previous games has been changed into something too close to the main attraction and thus loses its appeal. If a player loves Mario Kart and does not mind the lack of the traditional battle mode, Mario Kart 8 is definitely worth their time.. great game, but the battle mode is really bad, also the switch version is 100x better. Spent so much time playing at this with my parents. this is super bad game !!!!! I love DustinEden !!!! I love DustinEden !!!! I love DustinEden !!!!. It's just Mario Kart 7 but with anti-gravity. Not enough was innovated, it was a very uninspired entry that was heavily based on the previous title.. Oh, to be 10 years old and go to the store to buy this game, I still remember that day, this game is simply one of the best Wii U games, the DLC's add some of the best courses from old games and great new tracks. I give it a 9 because Deluxe is this game but better, the only downside 8 has is that battle mode.. I don't usually play any racing games, but damn, Mario Kart 8 is a true masterpiece. Every track is literally a sandbox, which gives you multiple opportunities to choose a way to reach the finish line. Moreover, you can't fall off the track, which makes the game much less frustrating. Graphics are top-notch. Everything is unbelievably smooth, colorful and eye-appealing. Framerate is very stable as well, so game runs perfectly. Overall MK8's gameplay makes for a very fun gameplay. Rules are easy and the game itself is literally 'Easy to learn, hard to master'. Moreover, it contains the local- and net multiplayer, which gives you tens of hours of unstoppable pleasure. I wish there was a better feeling of progression though. There're aren't actually any motivators for you to play so you have to find any goals yourself. At the end of the day, nothing but Silent Hill 2 is perfect, isn't it?. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Mario Kart 8 is the finest game on the Wii U. The visuals are incredible, and the game is fantastic, but the battle mode is the worst part of the game.. A great instalment of the Mario Kart franchise with a few problems. First off, the track selection is amazing and they all look graphically phenomenal. There are lots of unique tracks like Sunshine Airport, Cloudtop Cruise, Electrodrome, Mount Wario and more. This game also has the best retro track selection in the series so far, they’re all really fun to play and they have all been heavily updated with some tracks being barely recognizable like the GBA tracks and N64 Rainbow Road. The character selection is okay but not great. There are several important characters missing like Birdo, Dry Bones, Diddy Kong, Bowser Jr and King Boo, while it introduces a couple bad choices being Baby Rosalina and the worst Mario character ever, Pink Gold Peach! The music in this game is all live orchestrated which is a nice touch. This game’s main new mechanic is the anti gravity, which was an interesting idea and works very well. Online mode returns and it’s very solid. I do like the items they introduced in this game like the Piranha Plant and Super horn, but the item distribution is terrible. For example, you can get triple red shells in second or a coin in fifth. Speaking of which, the coin item is useless and comes up too often. The biggest problem about this game however is the battle mode, it stinks! There aren’t even actual stages, instead just modified versions of some of the tracks. But besides that, this game is awesome and I definitely enjoyed it on the Wii U.. The game is beautiful and the tracks are very cool too. But the AI is really easy to beat and there's always a lot of distance between the top 3-4 and the rest AIs. On the other hand, the online mode works really well but it could have more modes like on MK Wii. But it's a fun game overall so it's worth and 8.. One of the best Wii U games. It was so good that Nintendo ported it to the Switch instead of making a new Mario Kart for the platform.. Graphics still look great today, the tracks are really fun, but the character selection without the DLC is debatable, the battle mode is not fun, and how items work can be troubling for some.. +Nice character selection +Courses are nice +New items are great +Graphics are cutting edge +New modes +Mario Kart TV -Battle mode is messed up -Some clone characters -DLC is meh. Although the battle mode was really bad and the character selection could be better, the game is wonderful with amazing tracks and it just looks amazing.. i would give this a 75% This is a fun party game but they didn't really change a lot to it and it does not have anything different to it unlike the other Mario kart games if this is you're first time playing it it is a good game but it is just like the other Mario kart games but they just add new maps and charters i wish they added something new like double dash or something different they just did not really think out side the box.. Evergreen. This game is fun, you can play it with everybody. Anytime. And there are so many great tracks, characters and cars. The gameplay is superb, easy to learn and you can discover so much everytime you play again. My kids love this game too.. imply fantastic! Ladies and gentlemen, GO BUY A WII U FOR THIS GAME. Highly recommended for a fun gaming experience. Nothing on PS4 or XB1 comes close. 10/10. its honestly the best racing game ever to be made it is funny for family and freidns with online adn split screen play. What a game! Mario kart 8 is one of my favorite Wii U games. The controls are just incredible, even when using motion controls. The graphics are very impressive for a game on this console. The only things that do concern me is that the game has costumes locked behind an amiibo paywall. It's not that big of a deal, but I wish you could get the costumes by completing certain challenges as well as being able to unlock them instantly from the amiibo. Other than that, great game.. **** you only get 2 boxes if you playdrluxe and play against people that get them. The best mario kart to date, great fun with friends locally or online. Technically impressive, it makes you deserve to buy a wii u just for this game.. I like this title quite a lot. It has solidified controls that work well with the Wii U Gamepad, and the HD graphics blew my mind when I first saw this game. Where it certainly fell short though was the battle mode, which for one only offered Balloon Battle, and reused courses from the other modes instead of using real battle courses, which makes gameplay feel long and exhausting. Nonetheless, it still scored a 7.5/10 from me, placing it right in the middle of my Mario Kart list.. Mario Kart 8 its the best Mario Kart ever made. It has some problems with DLC, but in the end its an amazing game, with tons of content.. If you own a Wii U, this is simply a must have. This is the best game of the series.. Mario Kart 8 is an excellent racing game with many unique tracks modes and features, however there is some issues here and there. First of all the character selection is weak yes you have your Mario bowser peach Luigi but there was a chance to bring obscure Mario characters but no you get 5 baby characters 2 metal versions of characters and a bunch of nobody’s from the new super Mario games. However the customization is great, sadly whatever you chose changes your states which is kinda of a bummer. However the tracks make up for it, all the tracks are amazing with their very own style and unique designs. The modes are appreciated, but sadly the maps I think are to big for the battle modes. Online for the most part is alright it works...sometimes. Mario Kart 8 isn’t the best racing game ever but it tries to and does it well in the tracks and modes, I just wish there was more variety in the characters and more options, like don’t make the customization change your states or make the battle maps smaller. (Good 3/5) Give It A Try. Mario Kart 8 is a must buy game, and the only reason to buy a Wii U. This game much like his predecessor -Mario kart 7- gives you the ability to costumise your kart combination by using different tires gliders and karts. The game is lots of fun, and more can be added with the DLC wich -at really reasonable price -add 6 more characters ,8 new karts -5 karts 2 bikes and 1 ATM-, and four more cups ,wich are the Egg cup,Triforce cup,Crossing cup and finally Bell cup. This game is really fun and reccomended. Must play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Mario Kart is one of the most popular video game franchises, and that is for a reason. From SNES to Switch, Mario kart never failed to innovate. Each game felt incredibly different than the others. The SNES version was the first, the classic. This game worked incredibly well for the hardware that it is running on. Mario kart 64 was the official switch to 3d, and it ran a lot more smoothly than the SNES version. After 64 came super circuit, which was just insane to me. It basically is the SNES version, it does not have a lot of differences, but it does look better than SNES, even though it runs on a Gameboy Advance, which is a really crappy system, from a visual, audio and hardware- perspective. It is just crazy to me how this Mario kart runs so well on such a **** platform. After that came double dash, with a completely different concept than the rest of the games, with two characters in one car. For many people, this is their favorite of the series. Mario Kart DS was also really good and was very impressive fort he system that it was one. It had a really fun singleplayer mode, which no Mario Kart ever really had, and it was the first handheld Mario Kart that didn’t feel watered down. Then in comes Mario Kart Wii, with a complete do-over on the controls, with some motion sickness included. A lot of people adore these controls, I despise them. I hate this game, the tracks are amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the roster is amazing, but the gameplay got **** up because Nintendo didn’t give an option to race with the d-pad on the Wii mote. All of these games still are pretty amazing, but all of them lack extremely when you look at the newer games. The reason Mario Kart 8 overshadows all the others, is because of the insane tracks, the upbeat songs, the amazing retro races and the Nintendo lasagne that is the Mario Kart 8 roster. Let’s start with the tracks. The tracks in this game are absolutely mental from start to finish. Everything starts with Mario Kart Stadium, a track that is short, sweet, and gives a really good demonstration on the whole wall riding gimmick this game has adapted. It then continues with gems like Water Park, Sweet Sweet Canyons, Toad Harbor, Twisted Mansion and the best track of this game: Shy Guy Falls. These are only the two first cups, which there are 12 of. The tracks are insane, (Pokerap starts playing) Mount Wario, Cloudtop Cruise, Electrodome, Bone Dry Dunes, Ice Ice Outpost, Circuit HYRULE?!?!?!?!?!?!? The songs are also amazing, there is not one that ****. Of course, there are absolute jams like Yoshis Valley, Shy Guy Falls, Ribbon Roads, Wario Stadium, Electro Dome, Music Park. These are certainly the best, but the others are amazing too. Oh yeah, I forgot the Animal Crossing one. WAIT, ANIMAL CROSSING?!?!?!?!?!?!? The retro tracks have always ****. They were never memorable and they were just exploiting nostalgia for money. I thought it was going to be like that for Mario Kart 8, too, but it was quite the contrary actually. It was like they were completely new tracks. Toads Turnpike now had a completely different route on the walls, You could drive underwater at Cheep Cheep Beach and Wario Stadium felt different with the Z- and water section. The retro tracks were refreshing and a total blast, they were nostalgic and original at the same time. It was amazing. All of this makes for a great game, and the roster was pretty fine too. Although Pink Gold Peach really ground my gears. And the baby's are just a joke. Baby Rosalina? Really Nintendo? Nintendo? I think Reggie was too busy playing animal crossing new leaf on the new Nintendo 3ds during the development of this game because this is a joke. But these are just 5 characters, the rest are just classics. They even brought in the WAH himself. But there is one reason, that I have been hinting at very generously, why this game, in particular, is so exciting. On a juicy day called 13 November 2014, an update dropped. Link, the hero himself, got added tot he roster. Everybody went crazy. There also was an F-Zero track in the DLC-pack. This meant a lot. Mario Kart wasn’t just Mario Kart anymore, and this DLC and DLC-pack 2 proved this. This is the reason this game is so amazing, it marks the beginning of a new era. Who knows who we’ll get next. Will a wild Pokémon appear in the next game? Will Olimar pick a fight wit hall the Mario man? Will Kirby return to racing, like in Kirby Airride? It is all very exciting, Mario Kart just turned into Smash Kart, and I love it. Mario Kart 8 innovates, brings new ideas to the table and is extremely impressive with its audio and it is visually also very impressive. I give Mario Kart 8 a 9/10, because the online is still very limited.. This game is alright. The controls a little bit off. the stages are fantastic but i didn't enjoy this game as much as i thought i would.. The Perfect Mario Kart Game Mario Kart 8 (Until it’s Switch re-release) was by far the best Mario Kart game ever made.. One of the very best games for Wii U, and the best in its series at the time of release. Mario Kart 8 is held back only by its seemingly unfinished battle mode, which is best ignored. It's worth owning for collectors, but the Nintendo Switch port is so superior as to make the original obsolete.. What sport is it? Its a racing game. Was it fun? This is my second favorite Mario Kart game. Graphically it looks incredible, its fun to play and the tracks are well designed. Are there any similar games? The Mario Kart series is in its own category. Would you play it again? Yes, i really enjoy playing this game but unfortunately the online isn’t that much fun and so to me this is a local player game. Any complaints? Yeah, this game is not fun unless you’re playing with other people. Don’t get me wrong, its a great local multiplayer game but a very boring single player experience.. I love the colourful yet chaotic aesthetic. The series is coming ever closer to being simply called Nintendo kart with link and a few other non-Mario franchise characters. Nintendo really went all out with this one... But it's not the best entry in the franchise. Mario kart 8 has a large selection of fun tracks, characters and karts, amazing HD visuals, fantastic music, the gravity mechanic and online play that actually works. But, h o w e v e r, the battle mode is the crappiest in the series. but MK8 is still a solid title.. a lot of fun my actual score would be a 8.5/10 but i'll deal with what i have just beautiful. Amazing game amazing tracks poor battle mode tho. I'm not very satisfied with this game, the only thing I appreciated was the graphics, which are very good, but there are many things that disappoint me... This isn't a pure Mario Kart, because there are characters from universes other than Mario's. Notice that I'm not saying that I'm disappointed that there are characters from other universes, but I am disappointed that Mario characters weren't given priority. There are many Mario characters they could have used, such as Birdo, like in Mario Kart Wii, or doctor Toadley, shroob, princess shroob, kamek, fawful, kylie koopa, cackletta, popple. There are so many Mario characters to choose from, there's no need to get characters from other series. Another thing I dislike about MK8 are the physics. They're odd and you go faster if you hop. The characters' voices are too quiet compared to the background music that you hear much more. On top of that, the characters don't have enough voice clips, unlike Mario Kart Wii. I also dislike the rearranged tracks, particularly Wario Stadium. I think they could have done a better job with them. t's a great thing that the retro tracks have been improved, however, they have been modified a bit , which is something they should have avoided. Again, Wario Stadium is a good example of this Another bad thing about this game is the way the objects work. For example, if you keep a banana peel behind you, it doesn't disappear from the object icon like it should.. This game was very well-made and fun, too! It's hard to find any flaws in it, but i have one. You know how they limit chat? That also means there is no reporting hackers... Other than that, it's awesome.. I don't have a big ""intro paragraph"" for this review, so let's just cut right to the chase: ""Mario Kart 8"" is fantastic, and in my opinion, it is the best game on the Wii U. Even as a hardcore fan of the ""Super Smash Bros."" series, I've gotta say ""Super Smash Bros. for Wii U"" is not the best game on the Wii U (it's a close second). That title goes to ""Mario Kart 8,"" an absolutely gorgeous, rip-roaring, fun-filled, exciting time on the Wii U. On top of being gorgeous and fun, the music is brilliant and the online is actually pretty excellent, even on a console like the Wii U that has an awful online infrastructure. Sure, the roster may have a few too many unnecessary additions, and the Battle Mode may not be as exciting as the previous adventures, but at the very end of the day, ""Mario Kart 8"" is the one Wii U game that you absolutely must own. Looking for that one Wii U game that's as close to being ""perfect"" as you can get? Here it is: ""Mario Kart 8"" is phenomenal. Final rating: 10 out of 10 ""Fantastic"". I'm not sure which expansion pack I got, as I was a late comer to the Wii U platform (have only had it for about 2 years now). The version that i bought came with the Wii U already installed and expanded. This version of MK does not disappoint, and truly lives up to all of the previous versions of Mario Kart. So if you are a late bloomer like me, and have yet to get this title, I would highly recommend getting MK8 - you will not be disappointed.. Great game, revoultion for series that bring it back to the throne of kart games. Looks great, sounds great, only lacks battle mode. Great for playing with kids, they really enjoy it.. Mario Kart 8 is everything you should come to expect from a next-gen Mario Kart title. The visuals are beautiful: graphics are very detailed, and courses are colorful and eye-catching. The gameplay is nothing new for Mario Kart, as it employs all of the mechanics from previous games while new additions are minimal, ranging from a few new power-ups to some new kart customizations. Making a return from Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 7 are coins, which add some variety to the game and allows for some ""fun along the way"" as you try to grab coins to cap out your max speed. The revamped courses are gorgeous and very nostalgic, and the remixed music was a blast from the past. My personal favorites are N64's Rainbow Road, SNES's Donut Plains 3 and Wii's Moo Moo Meadows. One minor complaint I have about this game is the item balance, both in quality and quantity. First: one of the new items unleashes a piranha plant that frantically snaps its mouth, giving you speed boosts, nabbing nearby coins and knocking out opponents in the process. Although you only typically acquire the piranha plant when you're towards the bottom of the board, it seems a bit overpowered and does a lot for one power-up. Second: just like in Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 increases the number of concurrent racers from eight to twelve, which drastically increases the number of items on-screen. When I first picked the game up, I immediately jumped into 150cc Grand Prix. Being a veteran of the series, I've done this before with previous entries to challenge myself and was able to get accustomed fairly quickly. In just about every race this time around, I was in first place for more than half a race, ahead by a considerable distance, and then out of the blue I got hit with an assortment of three or four different shells that sets me back at least eight places and left me to finish the race in fourth at best. For a game that requires you to get first on all four races in a cup in order to get the best award for that cup, this is infuriating and incredibly frustrating. You can do everything right in a race (drifting, drafting, hitting speed boosts, doing tricks off every jump, collecting ten coins, etc.), only to be barraged with shells at the very last second and to be thrown into sixth place, forcing you to restart the entire cup and ultimately resulting in a waste of time. It feels like, no matter what you do, this game doesn't reward skill but simply gives you a slight chance of having a three-star rating fall into your lap, which honestly isn't fun in the slightest. Items aside, this game is very fun to play with friends and it's a very refreshing Mario Kart experience. Just don't expect to have much fun if you're in it even remotely for the achievement.. Mario kart as a franchise, throughout its 25-year history, has become not only one of Nintendo's go-to-games but also a firm classic in many gamers opinions. The latest full game installment to this franchise, Mario kart 8 for the Wii U, brings about more of the same traditional Mario kart with a breath of fresh air to keep this classic relevant in the modern era of gaming. The core of the single-player campaign gameplay remains almost the same as the previous game in the franchise. You choose from a selected roster of characters (most of which feature in previous Mario games) and race in grand prix consisting of 4 pre-determined races in order to unlock new characters, kart or bike choices or further grand prix. Of course, if you're on your own you don't have to play the single-player campaign; you can also set up a casual race, play in the battle mode or if you have an internet connection you can take your game to the online multiplayer mode. The multiplayer mode is the best yet in the franchise with a suitable ranking system that has you racing against players with various skill levels in order to extend your own personal score. The downside to this being that you can sometimes get into games with a limited number of players; this can cause the race to lose its competitive edge. In comparison to the previous games, Mario kart 8 looks stunning with a high definition glaze. As you glide around the colourful courses with your slick wheels twisting and turning you can't help but have fun. Despite its many upsides, you can't help feeling that Nintendo has finally hit their last peak for the franchise.. I just say that this is a must have game in your Wii U, i dont think is possible to make something better than an anti-gravity feature. The visuals, the music the gameplay everything is TURBO-TASTIC, but fails a bit in the battle mode.. This game is too much good quality and have a lot of guy + the koopaling are no appropriate. You can pay amiibo just for a Mii costume and the amiibo price like 16$. After the drop Mario Kart 7 was, the 8th game is a very decent improvement. The race tracks here are overall much better than those from MK7. The music is very memorable, the visuals are stunning for a Mario game, the redesigned tracks from previous games feel fresh and the online has a very good quality. But the 8/10 has its reasons: the character roster is by far the worst in the series, the difficulty is average, character voices are annoying, the new anti-gravity system is barely noticeable, the items are just too unbalanced for my liking and the game has the worst Battle mode in the series. Overall Mario Kart 8 will give you a lot of fun, but it will still leave much to be desired. (On a side note, I know the Battle mode is fixed in MK8 Deluxe, but at the time of writing this review, I have not played it yet).. 8.9 - Another great Mario Kart, although it lacked battle mode, and had the same issue of 1st to 12th as mentioned in my Mario Kart Wii review. Other than that, additional characters and DLC was well done, and online gameplay was fun.. It's a cool razing game and one of the best games for the WiiU. Good to Play with friends. And it makes fun on a party. Only critic point is, that the battle-mode is bad.. Incredible graphics, even for the WiiU, amazing gameplay, great musics, lots of content... This is an instantly fun game, wether it's offline or online, and it'll keep you busy for quite a while. Nintendo has delivered once again with its main IPs, if you own a WiiU, this is one of the must-haves. Mario Kart 8 is fun for all ages but can be enjoyed by the pros as well. Yes the battle system may ****, the item balance is not great, and the Rainbow Road may **** but this still is the best Mario Kart game to date. The tracks are beautiful and fun, there's a huge variety of characters and gravity system is amazing and one of the most innovative ideas in Mario Kart history. Overall Mario Kart 8 may have it's flaws but the good aspects of the game definitely make me forget about the bad stuff in the game.. Mario Kart 8, one of the best Mario Kart games ever made. A great selection of tracks, some tracks remade in glorious HD. And, it's being remade for the Switch too. Can't fault it, perfect game for some great single player time trials and online mode. Only flaw is no voice chat, but otherwise a great game.. Mario Kart 8 is a release that tries to bring many new things to the Mario Kart franchise. With a great online scene, there is always something to do. The stages and courses look better than ever and the soundtrack is top of the line. But while those things are terrific, the game tries a bit too much with the zero gravity driving and the paragliding. I feel like I have much less control over my kart compared to previous titles. I do not think those additions where refined enough. The item roulette is pretty bad in the game with distribution of items being weird. Blue shell not being able to fly feels like a minus. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable game but not one I'd marry. I'm happy to give this a 6/10. Decent.. Nintendo once again puts out another fantastic Mario Kart game, also bringing a new fresh game play dynamic in the form of gravity, the ability to go up or on the side of walls with your kart. Mario Kart does everything it intends to at a smooth 60FPS. Its a blast with friends and a blast online. My one quarrel is the lack of voice chat for online. Other than that great job Nintendo, can't wait for this game on the switch.. There is no much to say about that game besides the fact that is Mario Kart, I have a lot of fun, all courses on this game felt imaginative and the zero-gravity feature is cool, but not groundbreakin, the main problem of this game for me is the lack of a properly battle mode, but still, one of the most fun Kart games that I ever played. Another great Mario Kart game to add to the collection. Although the battle mode is poor the rest of the game is top notch and a certain buy if you own a Wii U.. The best wii u game, and surprisingly the best Mario kart game ever, it outdoes MK 64 and Double Dash. I was not expecting this game to be this good. It is one of the few games that is worth buying on the wii u. If you own a wii u and don't own this game yet, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? Seriously this game is awesome.. for about 60+ hours and obtained all easy, medium difficulty on gold on all maps. Mario Kart is fun to play, there is no denial, and if you have never played this genera before you will be having lots of fun, Mario Kart have detained the best title of its kind for a while, until i tried Sega all star racing transformed, that literally transformed my vision on Mario Kart.specially after playing both for a super long while: Mario Kart Pros: Solid character design Large variety of vehicles Bring nostalgia Can be addictive Colorful Rewarding unlocks Sonic All Star Transformed Pros Level great design Different ways of racing land see and air Level Musics Level Variety Fast paced , true feeling of racing Progress to unlock levels and other.

Brings barelly nothing new from previous mario karts Very expensive game at 59$ USD and 75$ CAN Dollars and rare discounts Few Modes Exclusive to WiiU Sonic All Star Racing Transsformed Cons Online match making is a little random. The Casino slot machines are kind of useless at times. Gathered Slot machine stars are too expensive to use.. the game was cool at everything! but if you don't have the DLCs it's a very short game that you can finish in just one hour :/ apart from all the gamemodes. Mario Kart 8 is the best of all of the Mario Kart games I have played so far. Its main attraction is its graphics which look amazing when playing in full HD. I have decided to list the positives and negatives of this game. Positives: -The tracks are very creative and fun. This especially goes for the tracks taken from previous games since they are given an updated look and have the new features implemented into them, but are still kept as close to the original as possible. -Online play is very fun with very little lag. I also like how you can have someone else play online mode on the same console. -The DLC adds a huge amount of extra content with its three different packs. These packs add new karts, characters, and tracks to the already huge collection of content. -The customization of karts returns from Mario Kart","the battle mode in Mario kart 8 is awful . the main game though, is good old Mario kart with an anti gravity twist . the battle mode is no longer as it was previously . it has now been forced into the current assortment of tracks ."
533.Super Mario Maker,"there is one major issue with this **** didnt support uploadingyour own levels which is sad for those who made good levels. This game is exactly what mario needed. Mario typically lacks that the courses are made by people targeting them to be simple and easy. Letting the community run wild was perfect. Super fun courses and perfect for a fun 2D mario game.. The game's concept is simplistic but works perfectly. The idea of building your own levels is fun, even if a few small objects or scenery are missing. The game is fairly complete and easy to access, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to challenge themselves.. I simply think, this game is overrated. To be honest, there is no too much content. Okay, i will start to review this game. The level creator menu is very interesting But it lacks more enemies and objects you'd wish to place And there's no slopes. WHY? The challenges are fun, but some of the levels are annoying And most of the uploaded levels (which are no longer playable, because Nintendo recently shut down the online servers of Wii U and 3DS) are even worse than those from Lost Levels. You cannot even create your own world map which ****. No other playable characters, because they are replaced by these Mystery Mushroom Skins. Multiplayer is also missed out there. And finally the most important thing: WHERE IS SUPER MARIO BROS. 2 GAME THEME? I get it, it's a Doki Doki Panic re-skin But it would be so cool to have this game theme as the unlockable, by completing the specific challenge mode. Overall, Mario Maker is a good level creator game Don't get me wrong But the sequel just expanded all of the missing content from it's predecessor. And the 3DS version is just more underwhelming, than this one. If you're enjoyed this one, then okay I still prefer sequel, because it's better.. since this game is about to shut down...tomorrow?! ill talk about mm1 briefly. it's a great game and im so glad it exists. giving fans the creativity to make games for everyone is great. amongst the piles of **** are some great levels to look back on. i never created them and i never felt like i needed to with how whole the game felt just playing the massive catalogue of levels.. it's fun dumb but fun making your own levels without Nintendo sueing you is nice and playing other levels is pretty fun I just with there was more stuff in the maker (note all this applies to the second game as well). This is the most creative game, Nintendo has ever released. Even though the Wii U shop is closed, you can download old courses from other players and build your own. Mario fans should definitely check this gem out. Overall rating: 9.2.. Yeah it does its job pretty good. Being allowed to play other peoples courses is pretty good too.. It'as an amazgin game, but seeing what's ahead It's very hard to play. Mario maker 2 for switch. This is what my childhood is built on. The amount of love and effort I put into levels really started my passion for building.. This was probably one of the coolest ideas of this console generation. It controls better than the sequel too.. Mario Maker 1 is a nice game, but Mario Maker 2 has arrived, and I'm at a loss for words.. one of the best utilizations of the wii u gamepad, and a terrific new direction for 2D mario games. This is a good game, but what may upset you is that if you upload a course, after a few weeks it WILL be taken off. Another thing they don't tell you is that you can shake some things and they change to something else. And despite a few flaws, it still is fun to make your own Mario levels.. Amazing tool to make your own Mario games. Wish they'd bring the Amiibo costumes from this into the sequel.. Simply the best idea Nintendo has ever had! Super Mario Maker is a masterpiece that can be played and created for years to come! If you still don't own a Wii U and consider ****, now is the time to switch over to pure gaming bliss! I can't give a higher. Very fun game make your own level and share them with the world jsut wished they made it 2 player split screen. everything i've ever wanted. infinite replay value and my goodness this game is go. Super Mario Maker is one of the most creative games and has one of the best ideas ever, but it seems Nintendo oddly doesn’t know how to support that idea. Making Mario levels is a dream come true and it feels good editing and creating stuff but the way to get those items is to wait, not joking you have to wait real life days to get 3-5 items per day this is so stupid. But at least all the items and tools available are fun and cool additions. Now you made your level and you wanna share to the world, I bet you think the online is good right? Wrong it’s terrible for some reason Nintendo forgot this game released in 2015 and use codes to search for levels wtf Little Big Planet 1 had a better search menu then this crap. But at least the levels are awesome, also this game has a neat mode where you play levels and have 100 lives, you also get amiibo costumes which are awesome but it’s so difficult to get sometimes. Super Mario Maker is a celebration of Mario games with 4 awesome games in one with an awesome Editing tool, sadly the online and the bad way of earning items and tools really make the game feel bad sometimes. (Good 3/5) Give It A Try!. When this game released, it was super fun. I had so much fun making levels, playing other people's levels, finding some great creators, commenting on levels on how fun they were. At release, this game was a 9 outta 10. Fast forward 3 months. The number of troll levels increases tenfold, Content Creators from YouTube get so much attention that it completely overshadows everyone else, Game Grumps makes over 100 episodes of their dumb show trying to beat levels and wastes even more of our time. After 3 months I was being sent troll messages and barely anyone was playing my levels, I was beginning to despise the game. Next thing we knew, Nintendo was just straight up deleting levels. My own levels were deleted permanently from the game's server, I was starting to get angry. Fast forward even more and Nintendo announces that Miiverse is being shut down; every post, every picture and every reaction to these levels were about to just disappear and never return. I have no idea if the messages were kept on a separate server, because by then I had completely given up on this ""Game"" that used to make me smile. By the end of this game's life, it is a 1/10. Thankfully they turned everything around with the sequel.. Great game, but far from perfect. It was an awesome idea, and well executed. It has flaws, but it has lots of love put into it.. An Absolute Blast! Mario Maker is a game where, well YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN MARIO LEVELS! HOW COOL IS THAT!?. Mario Maker is a fun time. Yes it may lack a lot of the mechanics that make the games so great but you'll find yourself building levels for months and months. It's community and creators pushed very ""non Mario"" levels foward that were crazy and unbearable. It had it's audience but I was not a part of it. Overall the game was super fun, not perfect but fun.. Super Mario Maker is one of the best games made by Nintendo. The game has a endless amount of levels to play and you can create your own levels post them for other people to play. If you can't find a level that you want to play you can just do the 100 Mario Challenge were the game picks levels for you to play. The 100 Mario Challenge also has multiple difficulty levels so you can pick the right difficulty for you. The only problem is that the level creator is missing some feature from the games the themes originate.. There's a strong argument to be made that Super Mario Maker is the best game ever released for Wii U. If nothing else, it comes closest to fulfilling Nintendo's vision for the troubled console: it makes perfect use of the GamePad, while offering a treasure trove of content that can be enjoyed both on the big screen and in off-TV mode. Making courses is easy and fun, and you'll never run out of new levels to try. Just be wary of the 99 Mario Challenge; on the highest difficulty level, you'll run into a lot of troll courses that are nearly impossible to beat.. Even when Mario Maker 2 comes out, I will still come back to play this masterpiece.. This is an amazing game and the best way to celebrate Mario's 30th anniversary! Super Mario Maker is a fantastic Wii U game allowing players to create their own Mario courses with four different themes, and several different items and enemies from the entire series. The level design has a very simple to learn interface that allows players to create courses and share them to the world via Course World. Playing other people's courses online from the course world is very fun with courses that span from easy to very difficult. There's also 100 Mario Challenge for players to play other people's courses and earn rewards. Simply this has to be one of the best games for the Wii U with heavy replay value and lots of content. Super Mario Maker is a perfect creation kit with years of Super Mario history in one game. For Wii U owners, you should definitely get this game. It's not only a fantastic game, but it's a perfect celebration of Super Mario.. The Nintendo 3DS version was the worst, but the Wii U version is the best ever!. This game is the high point of the Wii U. While the community has its fair share of bad, difficult, or troll levels, the amount of creativity that goes into the rest is absurd. You can do things you would never see in a mainline Mario game. There is always something to do, a new level to play, or a new idea to try out. If you still own a Wii U, this game is a must-have. Unless it comes out on Switch. (P.S. - Do NOT get Mario Maker for 3DS, as it does not have the Mystery Mushroom, and online level sharing is removed.). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Let's be honest, the Wii u was certainly a flop on Nintendo's part, with nearly all games being forgettable and rehashing insistences that were also becoming apparent that Nintendo was lacking in the creativity department. This is the one game that nearly turns that notion around as its saving grace. I bought a Wii U simply for the sake of accessing this game! Giving you a chance to bring some ideas to life, as well as challenge to anonymous players from across the world! I wouldn't give too much credit though, there are some people who've single-handedly outdone this concept, such as Hello's Engine for GameMaker. And that's free! But, since not everybody's knowledgeable about things like that, I guess this will have to settle for the sake of ease-of-access creativity sharing.. The game was fun. Level design was in your hands. It was fun playing friends levels and it was fun watching friends play my levels. The game did get boring after a while. I really hope they come out with a Switch version.. this game is amazing if it was just Mario it would be a 8/10 but no, mystery mushrooms allow you to become characters, this brings true freedom to the player to create anything they want for 30$ this game is a masterpiece but if it was 60$ it would be above average. my 2 problem with it that people's levels are bad still this game is amazing a must buy for all Wii U owners.. A gem on the wii u library. Instead of making yet more of the new smb game series, we got instead a game were we can make our own smb stages, picking from a gigantic variety of options.. super mario maker is simply a master pease the amout of creativivdy is is MIND BLOWING I HIGHLY RECAMEND SUPER MARIO MAKER TO ALL PEOPLE WHO LOVE VIDEO GANES. As a celebration of Mario's 30 years, Super Mario Maker does a decent job, but I find it somewhat overrated. This game is really good to test your imagination when makning Mario levels. You can post your levels online, as well as trying other people's creations, which can give hours of challenges. amiibo functionality is great, as it unlocks costumes that you can still obtain in the 100-Mario challenge. You get tons of items and space to create the greatest level in Mario's history, and even choose the visual style (from the original Super Mario Bros, SMB 3, Super Mario World and New SMB U). All of this, and you get a game that is almost endless. However, it's drawn back by huge flaws. Some levels online are just bland and uninspired. The 10 and 100 Mario challenges feel like filler content sometimes. Your experience depends on your levels's popularity. And the biggest flaw is that, if you have Parental Controls on your Wii U, you get the most mediocre Mario game of all time (Mario Maker without online deserves a 5/10, or even a 4/10, A.K.A., the 3DS version I did not even think about playing). But Super Mario Maker will still give you a lot of fun most of the time. Thousands of online levels give the game HUGE replayability, which is something many Mario games lack. If you are a huge Mario fan, this is the game for you. It's a good game, and you can expect many great things about it. Just try to keep those expectations not too high, because if you expect a masterpiece from a level editor, it's quite likely that you'll feel dissappointed.. This game is amazing. You will never get bored of playing this game because there is an infinite amount of levels that you can play,and there is the 100 mario challenge.. Super Mario Maker is loads of fun. Putting the creators mind into to you, Mario Maker's selections for level design are infinite, and having the ability to post your stages online helps ascend this game to god hood. Fun is to be had with Super Mario Maker, take my word for it. A game who uses to the limit the capacity of the Wii U Gamepad, and the dream of many Mario fans. The game is more fun than using Lunar Magic for sure and the fun it offers seems endless, so many things you can do that cannot even done in the original Mario games, a great way to celebrate 30 years of jumping up.. Super Mario Maker is the next big milestone in the 2D Mario series after New Super Mario Bros. Going into the game with relatively low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of fun I actually had with this title. Mario Maker's gameplay is clearly divided into two big facets: playing levels and creating levels. I actually got into Mario Maker because I thought playing other people's levels was going to be the really entertaining. To be honest, I've never really cared about the level creation. Being able to create my own Mario levels is something that has never got me excited, despite being a fan of 2D Mario platformers. But surprisingly, making levels ended up being my favorite part of the experience by far. One thing that should be noted if you’re planning to play Mario Maker is that this is a game that takes an active effort from your part to be truly enjoyable. This isn’t a game that you just put and enjoy. Well, you can do that if you only play levels, but to get the most out of Mario Maker it takes a bit of creativity and effort from the player. Initially I thought this was going to be a problem for me, believing that I would be staring at a blank level creator without any ideas on what to make at all. But fortunately, once you start messing around with the tools you’re given, fun ideas just emerge naturally. And once you get on a streak of creativity, that’s when Mario Maker realizes its full potential. That’s when the game becomes truly addicting. The level editor is very accessible and enjoyable to use. Some things are missing, sure, like pools of water, certain enemies, power ups and such, but overall it feels complete. It has a pretty big repertoire of tools from previous Mario games for the player to use. I wish the enemy limit would be a bit higher, but it’s still alright. Mario Maker is very self aware that people are going to create stupid and nonsensical levels, and because of this the game offers a lot of tools for doing just that, crazy levels that are pure nonsense. The presentation is very good. The developers clearly intended to make this game as user friendly as possible. The game is full of silly gags and secrets. Like once I got a notification with a random philosophical quote involving chain chomps. Funny things like that are all over the place. The online functionalities are well optimized. Uploading your courses and seeing other people give you stars and comments is always satisfying. You can even see the parts of your levels where people die, and also the clear percentage. There are also official courses uploaded by Nintendo, which are pretty good. But there’s a problem with Mario Maker’s online. One that anyone will notice very soon. The problem is that nobody in the world knows how to make good levels, or even decent ones. 90% of the levels are either a cakewalk made by a 5 year old, troll levels, levels that play themselves, levels full of dumb gimmicks, or in the opposite side, levels that are so hard that nobody but a hardcore Mario player can enjoy. There are good levels every now and then, and playing bad levels can be fun and even hilarious at first, but the novelty wears off quickly. There is always some fun to be had with 100 Mario challenges and such, and this is definitely a good option to have around if you feel like playing some Mario, but if you want to play good Mario levels that are actually well done, you better stick to New Super Mario Bros U. So overall, this is a game that never caught my attention because I didn't care about making my own Mario levels, but once I started playing it and dedicating myself to creating levels, Mario Maker finally clicked on me. I could finally see what all the people saw back in 2014 when the game was announced. Mario Maker was truly a great way to celebrate the ex-plumber's 30th anniversary, and is a game I can totally recommend to anyone interested in 2D Mario, creating platformer levels, or game design in general. Score: 8.5. If you have rich imagination and always wanted to create Mario levels give it a try. If not you can play some levels made by people, but they aren't perfect as levels stragiht from Nintendo gods of level design.. Super Mario Maker is a groundbreaking achievement for Nintendo that fully realizes the concept and potential of the Wii U platform. The game utilizes the gamepad better than any other title in the system's library and the extent of creative options in the maker mode turns a construction zone into a playground. Mario Maker's reliance on online components is simultaneously the game's biggest strength and downfall - the experience is basically made or broken by the strength of the community.. Very fun title to share your creations with friends, but this is not a complete Super Mario Bros creation tool, as it lacks a lot of the things and possibilities we see on the classic Super Mario games.. This is like Mario heaven. Not only can you make your own Mario levels, you can also play thousands of courses that other people have made. A must buy if you own a Wii U. One of the best ideas for a game ever. Well done Nintendo.. You know what's funny, is that before this game came out I actually had dreams of something like it existing. Crazy, right? An official Nintendo-published video games for a console that allows you to make your own Mario levels. I'd been using unofficial and poor-quality programs on the Internet allowing you to do just that for the longest time, so God am I happy this game exists. It's so much better than what you can illegally find on search engine. In Super Mario Maker, the possibilities are endless! (Well, maybe not literally, but to the point where new level concepts are being made all the time) Sharing your very own Mario levels all across the world is an easy and fun experience, and I often found my levels being played more than I expected due to the good balancing of accessibility. Creative courses are being made by several people every day, and there's always something new to try. There's a great interface and a substantial amount of tools for plenty of gimmicks. Even if you don't consider yourself a ""creative"" person; give this a shot! I can promise you you'll at least put hours into the levels created by others.. This game deserved be released a lot of years behind, in same time of Little Big Planet. Ok, the possibilities if you compare this game with LBP are less, too much less. But the Mario universe helps this game, and you can enjoy all Mario games across the years. Awesome game, must buy. I bought this launch day and over a year later it's still fun. You do have to spend some time searching online to get to the really good levels, but there are many amazing levels out there. Building levels is fun too, with a good variety of items in the palette. For the most part the physics and general control schemes match up with the game style. Super Mario world levels feel very similar to how they did on the SNES and New SMB levels feel as they did on the NSMB games previously release for the Wii and Wii U. Great game overall for those that are a fan of the side-scrolling Mario games and/or those who like to create things. Highly recommended.. This game is amazing, My favorite Wii U game I played, and here is why Super Mario Maker allows you to make your own Mario Maker levels with 4 different themes and 30+ different course elements by either shaking or putting something on it, this allows people to easily get into game design and also allows malicious people to make some of the hardest Mario Maker levels ever, albeit there are a few flaws but the game does make up for it, lets list them -Not much Nintendo takes from the community -Takes all stars away from people who make glitch levels -Very easy to copy downloaded levels +More than just playing levels +Provides kind of frequent updates +Easy reportation to take down Copied levels. Super Mario Maker is absolutely brilliant! Everyone knows the Italian plumber and his platforming adventures, and now you get your very own cornucopia of infinite Mario fun. Both casual and hardcore gamers of all ages will find something to enjoy here. If your a seasoned platforming expert looking for challenge, you will find it here in boatloads! You can easily sort levels by difficulty and find what best suits your play style. If your a novice just starting out try some easy of normal levels. More of a veteran? Don't worry! Some expert levels will provide even the most hard-boiled gamers with decent challenge. As for the level designing aspect, it's amazing as well. Everything is streamlined and easy to learn so gamers of all ages are welcome! I think it's that broad appeal that gives Super Mario Maker it's undeniable quality. If you like platformers in some capacity, you will find enjoyment in this game. Even if you don't enjoy playing levels, there's millions of levels you still play and share with others easily. If your on the fence about this game, let me assure you, you will find so much to love in Super Mario Maker!. And that is what sums up this game: an anticipation of what’s up next. With such a vibrant community and already 1,000,000 levels uploaded, anything can be possible. That is what keeps me playing. That is what keeps me creating. It’s a drive to be a part of the community and a desire to build into such a formidable culture. Super Mario has been engrained deep into many cultures and with the arrival of this game comes the arrival of a deeper level of investment into who Mario is and who we get to make him to be.. The good: If you're a thoughtful, creative person, you have a fantastic medium to express yourself in this game. Creating levels is easy to do. Further, not only can you *create* the levels, you can have literally anybody in the world play the levels and critique and make comments on them. It feels great when you put your soul into creating a clever level and have someone give you positive feedback. There are good tools available to help you fine-tune your levels to perfection, including being able to drop yourself into the level at any point and with any power-ups, and a gameplay-path tracer so you can master your obstacle/enemy positioning. Most of the levels you play will be pretty decent levels that feel very ""Mario."" That's a very good thing. Occasionally, however, you'll come across incredible, fantastic levels that make you wish Nintendo would hire those people to design levels for the actual Mario games. And then there are other great levels that aren't very long, but rely on execution of a single difficult trick to complete, that will make you feel like you've accomplished something impossible when you finally get it. The number of n00b-fodder levels is limited by a clever system. When you start the game, you can only upload 10 levels to share, but if your levels are acclaimed by people ""starring"" them, you will be allowed to upload more levels. This way, the number of levels designed by people who **** at level design are limited while people who make fantastic levels will be able to upload more, thus making better levels available to you. Oh, and if you don't like a level, you can skip it. The not-so-good: Play a ""100 Mario Challenge"" and I guarantee you that you'll come across at least one level that bothers you. While there are (rarely) some clever ""auto-Mario"" stages where you don't touch anything and you're bounced around on springs et al, I hate most of the ""auto-Mario"" style levels. There are also levels that are neither original nor very ""Mario"" feeling, or any good at all. And while the addition of special effects can marginally enhance a level, more often than not those special effects are abused to make super, super annoying levels. Also in the negative column: It's not very fun to watch your kids make levels. All in all: I recommend this game. If you don't have a Wii U, I'd recommend buying one just to get this game, and even though I don't rate it as highly as some other games, I don't usually recommend buying a Wii U just for most other games.. If you are a mario brothers super fan THIS is your game my friend! Everything in game is BUILD BUILD and BUILD! I can tell you this is the game I most played on this week! You can enjoy Thousands of thousands of levels around the world makers! The servers are super stable! You don't need to worry about paying for a membership to play this game, and yes, You can make thousands of mixes in level design, your onliest limit is how crative are you? Just play this game, Seal of approval.. Super Mario Maker is one of the defining games for the Wii U. It really shows off how the Wii U GamePad is made to be more compelling compared to other systems. You can play the game without the TV, and the touchscreen being really convenient. It's presented in the same way as Mario Paint from the SNES. It may be goofy, but it's fun. The same can be said for Super Mario Maker. The UI may a bit silly, but it's enjoyable. For example, you can play a loaded course on the title screen! You can place nearly all types of enemies and items in your levels, and choose from 4 different themes with those from the NES, SNES, and the Wii U. There are a lot of things you can do and you can even break the rules of Mario to make your level a ton of fun. If you want to get the game just because you want to play other users' levels, I say go right ahead. There are literally tons of new levels uploaded every day, and from what I'm seeing, they're challenging, but fun. I don't want to deduct points from this game for levels made by players that are nearly impossible to beat because that's saying more about the user's style, not the game. Ever since we were kids, we wanted to make our own Mario levels. Today, you can live that dream if you buy Mario Maker for the Nintendo Wii U.. A very commendable effort, and generally fun to play around with, however, I did find it to be a bit bare bones in a lot of places. The customization is a bit lacking, as there are aesthetic designs that I feel could have been put in without too much trouble. The Star system doesn't feel reliable, since it doesn't seem to really reward players for making good levels that much and there is really no way to discourage players from making bad levels. The search feature is also largely incomplete, as there's no way to search for a level by name and it's extremely easy to not be able to find a level again. The challenge modes are also largely disappointing. Since it's completely random which levels you get, you'll very often end up with levels that are either terribly designed or were specifically designed to steal lives from you, with no way to punish players for doing this. This is especially true in the higher difficulties, where it is completely possible to end up having half of your lives taken from you without being given much chance to avoid losing them. Overall, I will name this as a good first effort, and simply hope they add more to any hypothetical second game.. Nintendo is running out of ideas but the games aren't all bad to be clear. But I think this game is just bland and nintendo just gave up besides that the game is great but I hate the community making impossible levels like don't do anything levels and other TERRIBLE levels.. This is a fantastic game with fantastic ideas and variability. It is a chance to play limitless classic Mario, to express your creativity, and to experience that of others. It has it's flaws, but imperfection in a video game often does not eclipse its ability to profoundly entertain. If you're unsure if you'll like it, rent it or borrow a copy from a friend. If you like it as I did, you'll find yourself buying your own copy soon.. Super mario maker is the best wii u game out there and you should right now pick it up why? Well ofc it's cuz you can make your own mario levels isn't that your dream since you played mario for the first time? If not then get out. 10/10. Why didn't Nintendo think of this earlier?This game is as simple as it sounds:you can make your own Mario levels and share them to the world!Almost every single object from the main Mario series is in this game,and you can make a lot of levels out of it,as well as new objects such as the Mystery Mushrooms.However,this game suffers for a few reasons. 1.There are way too many crappy levels that are either extremely difficult because of cheap invisible blocks,or dull and uncreative ones where you literally do nothing and watch Mario make it to the end of a level(this is a trend in the community).There are some truly creative and fun levels in there,but they gets overshadowed by the pile of bad ones. **** are way too limited at the beginning,where you can only use a certain amount of objects before a new shipment comes the next day.I'd rather just have all the materials right when I get the game instead f having to go through the process of resetting my Wii U **** only that,you can only upload 10 levels at a **** problem with this is there are WAY too many levels out there,and only 3 or 4 people are going to play your level per **** you're forced to beg your friends to star your levels so they don't get kicked off the server in a **** can eventually upload more levels with a certain amount of stars,but you'll probably need to beg your friends to do that. Conclusion:Super Mario Maker is a brilliant concept that was executed fairly ****'s not Nintendo's fault the community makes such annoying levels.. This shows that Nintendo still knows what they are doing. They took a simple idea being done for years and made it blossom. The maker tool is so simple and works so well. There are four styles of mario games to play with. I thought I wasn't creative enough to do anything good in the game but even then I made some pretty fun levels. Having an online server with infinite levels is great for the Wii U with a game you can play for as long as the servers are up. Sure there are troll levels which is very annoy","the game's concept is simplistic but works perfectly . the idea of building your own levels is fun, even if a few small objects or scenery are missing . the level creator menu is very interesting but it lacks more enemies and objects ."
534.Tekken 5,"Tekken 5 is a peak fighting game experience. It has a good graphics for it's time, great characters introduced, has a vast customization, new setof moves, and one of the greatest stories of the Tekken series. It's a solid choice, and Tekken 5 could be one of the best fighting games in the history.. ""Tekken 5"" is one of the best fighting games on the PS2. Combat is faster-paced and more refined than in previous entries. The roster is made up of 32 fighters including 7 new characters. You can customize them with new costumes, colors, items and accessories. There are also several modes to choose from including Story, Survival, Time Attack, Arcade Battle and the side-story, ""Devil Within"". In addition, ""Tekken"" 1 - 3 are included. In terms of graphics, this is one of the best looking titles on the console. Overall, I would rate ""Tekken 5"" with a 9 out of 10.. Best tekken. Enough said exept some information of the game that im gonna write right now (this game is realised ESCLUSIVLY on the ps2 and it's a fighting game whit a lot of characters). One of the greatest fighter games, I would give it a 10 if the difficulty of the story mode and The Devil Within mode final boss was fair.. The fighting game i played the most in my life. I played it for years, with so many people that i could not make a list. From family to HS friends, to college friends, to coworkers.. Objectively the best Tekken game, even though it's outdated for today's standards, it's still a pretty good package overall. The character roster is just perfect, every character looks and plays well. The core gameplay is fun but unfortunately a bit unbalanced, and the boss fights can be quite challenging. The music is great, and the stages look nice. I consider this game the peak of the series, it's a very complete game. Final Rating: ""Good"" ~ 7/10.. Tekken 5 is a fighting game developed and published by Namco for the arcades in 2004, and for the PlayStation 2 in 2005. It is the fifth main and sixth installment, in the Tekken series.. Not quite as good as Soulcalibur II, but the best of the Tekken games also comes bundled with the arcade versions of Tekken's 1, 2 & 3 making it an essential purchase for beat 'em up fans.. Masterpiece game. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning. The best ""Tekken"" game on the PS2. It's visually spectacular, features a ton of fighters and several modes. It is the PlayStation 2's equivalent to the Xbox's ""Dead or Alive 3"". This is a must own for the fans of the fighting genre. Great stuff. I would rate it with a 9.2 out of 10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My favourite childhood game on the ps2 to this date. Was very fun back then and still is today the best tekken entry in my opinion. Doesn't include all the classic characters (!) and offers them as DLC ! Controller disconnects everytime when you go to main-menue. Simple Plug and Play to play versus? Good luck with that!. This game is beautiful until today, its setting, destruction of the scenery and character design are perfect. Can I say this is my favorite fighting game ever? Well, i guess so. Almost twenty years later, you can play it and still get the same vibes the present tekken give you, with no doubt, whatever the tekken 10 or 234597 be in that day. Also, it had the arcade games and a lot of playing modes, it was the whole-package. Ten, ten, ten across the boards, honey.. Story: 70/100 Gameplay: 100/100 Graphics/Art Style: 90/100 Music/Soundtrack: 100/100 Character Design/Costumes: 100/100 Regular Enemies: 100/100 Bosses/Boss fights: 100/100 World/Level Design: 90/100 Playability (Bugs and optimization after patches): 100/100 Would I Play It Again?: Yes Where Does It Rank In My Top 500 Video Games of All Time List?: 14 Rating: 90/100. one of the best fight games ever have everthing that a game like this must have story mode for every character arcade mode to personalize and shop customs and lot of maps and characters to choose instead of having to buy them you have to unlock them. While Tekken 5 took some steps into the right direction for the series, it also scarified some of its characters in the process.. An excellent arcade fighter from that time. If you find it at a game shop buy it (it's like £5 max) call a friend or don't, sit down and tackle reasonably balanced ai using all sorts of combos. It's characters are unique and fun to use so you won't get to bored with the game. Absolutely worth it overall 9/10.. Easily one of the best entries in the Tekken series and one of the best fighting games on the PlayStation 2, Tekken 5 takes the series to the next level. The fighting is a lot of fun to learn and pulling off combos and special attacks can be very satisfying. The graphics look great for its time and there are many modes outside the main story mode to provide challenges for the player, such as Arcade Mode, Time Attack and Survival Mode. My favorite mode is easily the Arcade Mode, as I had played 33 stages to get to the top. However, there are some issues with the game, such the enemy AI can be a pain in the ass to beat and the final boss is very difficult. The boss is so overpowered, it took me a long time to beat him. That's **** Anyway, Tekken 5 is still a great fighting game and I highly recommend it to any fan of the franchise.. Classic tekken. Very good fighting game with interesting characters. One of my first games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is just awesome and i dont know how you can dont like it but okay. Probably the best Tekken game, great stages and music, perfect character roster and many game-modes to play.. Best tekken ever released and best fighting game for ps2. Not much to say. THAT KANGAROO WAS BROKEN AF.. One of the best Tekken games so far, it is amazing playing with this characters such as Yoshimitsu, Jin Kazama... Every character with their own story but everyones ends with the iconic final boss, Jinpachi Mishima.. Overrated as hell by the fans Tekken 3 is still better Tekken did not have it easy in the PS2 era.. The final game of what I would consider the ""Tekken classic age"", as well as my second favorite Tekken title. This has the sensibilities of a classic 3D fighter, but you can feel the leanings to more modern style of Tekken. The juggles aren't MvC-level half HP wonkiness like later entries, but are probably best combination of damage and execution based that the series has. The game has many modes, a beat-up-up mode, a story mode (like a basic arcade mode), another story mode based on Jin, and my personal favorite, arcade mode. The arcade mode in this is not your standard 8 fights and then get a character ending. It is more akin to playing an endless stream of enemies, and ranking up after so many wins to fight harder ranked enemies until you hit ""Tekken Lord"" rank. This mode really lets you test your stuff against an AI and you can really see your improvements as you go up. Tekken 5 is a solid 3D fighter, and a neat little send off to the classic Tekken formula (it even has Tekkens 1, 2 and 3 on-disk) before the series became all e-sports.. This game was my childhood,perfect balanced,epic characters,amazing story and graphics ahead of its time. A great Tekken with exciting gameplay, a large roster, memorable stages, and tons of content. The Devil Within adventure mode is a bit dull and not as good as Tekken Force and the final boss of the Story Mode is undeniably cheap, but that is balanced out by a polished product that even features full versions of the first three Tekken games!. One of the greatest games that was ever created ! Tekken5 Legendary classic ! Amazing soundtracks amazing stages awesome fighting game Cant say anyzing bad About Tekken5 spend over 6 years playing it !. The game that revived the series after the mixed reception of Tekken 4. I love this game. The graphics were so realistic for the time and were a big improvement over Tekken 4. They looked so impressive. I love the stage designs much more than Tekken 3 and Tekken 4. The soundtrack is THE best out of the series. I dare say it's better than the Tekken 3 soundtrack. The sound effects are brilliant. I love the sound of punches, kicks and deathcries. The gameplay is better than Tekken 4. It brought back a lot of the original characters and also gave us the original trilogy in arcade form which was really good. It also gave us one of the most famous and hardest final bosses in fighting game history. I did like the Devil Within mini game but it was too short. The Starlight mini game was disappointing. The AI is also very unforgiving and heavily unbalanced. It is so much fun though despite its flaws. This is a must buy.. As close to perfection as you can find in a fighting game. Same legendary balance between complex movesets and accessible controls, fan-freaking-tastic action, and by far the most visually pleasing backgrounds in the series, nay, the entire genre. It's just like stomping in someone's skull over the Mona Lisa. Plus, the damn thing includes Tekken 1 through 3 on-disc. Why didn't I give it a 10? Because for some reason, Tekken games on the PS2 never supported analog controls. Why?? Sure, you get used to it, but you SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. Some people say the direction controls are tighter on the D-pad... to them I say, go back to 1995 and take Madonna with you.. The best part of Tekken on Playstation 2, and in general the best fighting game for PlayStation 2 in my opinion. In this part of the game we sell all the events and family disassemblies of the Mishima family, watch the fifth iron fist tournament and sell the arcade mode.. It's a great game, it's possibly mechanically one of the if not the best fighting game for the PS2, however it is incredibly unbalanced and broken in difficulty and AI. Easy is much more like Hard mode on other Tekken games, it throws you in the deep end. Seemingly the highest ranked AI are sometimes easier than lower ranked AI in Arcade mode and is a lesson in frustration. Other than that issue it's a solid fighter.. Tekken 5 is a fighting game developed and published by Namco. It is the fifth canonical installment, and sixth main installment, in the popular Tekken series. + One of the Best Fighting Game of PS2 + Excellent Graphics + Ending Cutcenes + Devil Within + Excellent Rooster + Ranking and Customization. Tekken 5 is the fighting game classic game that is played only 1 vs 1 The challenge between friends makes it very exciting . The choice of characters is very wide as their skills .. Tekken 5 is the best 3D fighting game history. Many moves, great history, many possible combos, incredible graphs for the PS2 and the time it was released, a lesson in how to make a great fighting game, many characters, each of them has a great history and all are charismatic, unlike TRASH Virtua Fighter.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While some of the extra modes aren't as strong as they could have been, the core fighting is nearly perfect, whether you're playing against other humans or computer-controlled opposition.. This game is really good. I'm not a big fan of fighting games but this one gave me a lot of great fun with (and without) friends. Awesome for VS. mode and really enjoyable for single.. Tekken 5 I consider worthy farewell to the PS2. Slightly improved graphics compared to its predecessor and a lot of interesting characters. To combat system I just can attach a little because not entirely satisfied me. There were a few things that could be improved but they were trifles. Story is pointless but has anyone ever seen a fight game with a good storyline? Tekken 5 is one of the ""must have"" for the PS2.. This game is a master of fighting genre. If not all, the most of the characters are very interesting and if you decide to master one of them it will take a lot of your time and you'll be happy for that. Arenas are good and music is something from nothing, but if you want to fight in a more serious style, turn it off (I did it for a while). The most important you have to know is that you have to be patient, because the game demands patient players or gamers, who have patience and will be very skillful. Namco didn't create TEKKEN for it to be played from everyone. No, Namco made this game to make fans and it actually worked.. the best tekken ever with amazing visuals and so many characters to choose from it is just amazing the only bad thing about this game is the final boss he is so cheap and so difficult even on the easier difficulties but still the best tekken ever. Obviously one of the best fighting games you will ever play.Characters are awesome and action and arcade mode are the best.I mean when you beat your enemy you got too see how you beat him with slow motion effects.They should do that in other fighting games too.. Why people want easy bosses? Jinpachi is what it was meant to be, a BOSS. Difficult, frustrating, but is the gratest boss on Tekken, and it's even playable on TTT2.. The best fighting game to date. For me it tops even Tekken 3. Great graphics, smooth animations, many characters and the gameplay is superb. Tops every other fighting game.. Well, that's a great fighting game for PS2. The visuals are amazing considering the platform, animations are very good and the combo system is awesome too. Gameplay is harder than its predecessors and that is a great thing, considering they were a little bit easy for hardcore gamers. Another great point of this game is that Tekken, Tekken 2 and Tekken 3 arcade modes are available for playing, that's good for remembering the old times. Unfortunately there's no online mode, but Tekken 5 is a great game where Namco willed it to be.. The LAST best Tekken game including Dark Resurrection. Hands down everyone. This game went back into its original roots and played similar like Tekken 3. Its soundtrack was also outstanding but not as good as Tekken 3. This game had the most bonus's ever in the franchise. A Devil Within mode, Tekken, Tekken 2 and Tekken 3. Their was also an old shooting game where your in a spacecraft but I forget its name. So its got the bonus's/re-play value completely covered. Story is good and goes into cut scenes involving the fighter your playing. This is the last best Tekken game before it all went downhill. Funny because ever since Tekken went mulitplatform it went downhill. Hopefully they return exclusive to the PlayStation brand.. wtf am i seeing!?!?!? intro star fox intro movie fatal frame. graphics looks like star fox/ even tekken 2 is better. Tekken 2 3 and 6 are the best why did they ever make this. A good fighting game realized by Namco Bandai, who have crafted a good story mode for each character succeeded, more than 25 characters, versions Tekken 1-3 and a good mission with Jin Kozama.. Effective fighter, and good gameplay is worth the play by new gamers that want fighter's. Great catalog of good fighters in it which is fine. The bad thing is that is to slow the scheme, and frustrating. Tekken is classic followed by tekken 3 , but tekken 5 fails to do dome stuff, but not in the big way.. It's not the best of the series, but Tekken 5 still offers refined gameplay and some great new features. Pros: Beautiful graphics; stunning level design; variety of fantastic characters; a lot of extras, including Tekken 1-3. Cons: Lacks the innovation its competitors are shrouded in; sluggish adventure mode; no online play.","Tekken 5 is a fighting game developed and published by Namco for the arcades in 2004 . the core gameplay is fun but unfortunately a bit unbalanced, and the boss fights can be quite challenging . Tekken 5 is the fifth main and sixth installment, in the Tekken series ."
535.F.E.A.R.,"Very good enemies AI. This game is not scary. You have more FPS moments than horror experience.. A pretty decent on the rails shooter that lacks variety in combat and environments. I also got annoyed at the last level. The plot doesnt make a ton of sense and comes off as a cheesy haunted house. People say the AI is great but Halo and Half-life have better AI. Possibly the lamest ""boss fight"" ever.. Good game. It is a tense corridor-shooter (most of the time), where you shoot ATC securities or Replica soldiers on the way to get the objectives. Variety of places is decent enough, although game has focused about on events on ATC building. So, replayability is not.... It's above average. Lackluster, but precious. Like a cloudy crystal you keep for nostalgia alone.. Honestly the best fps game ever made. It's atmosphere perfect, Combat Perfect, Story Good and Characters Perfect. It's one of my favourite games of all time. Such a shame the future games didn't live up to fear1. It's a game with a lot of detail for its time, but it's too clunky for today. There is no variety in the gameplay and you fight against a single enemy type for the entire game. I wouldn't say it's very scary either. The story seems interesting at first but loses its impact after a few hours. The gameplay is just about killing an infinite number of SWAT teams in similar locations, and the story just feels like an excuse to do it in the **** gameplay is not intuitive and you don't always understand where to go or what to do. I don't think the power to slow down time is very useful, and most of the time I forgot it even existed. The flashlight system is terrible. Every few minutes you have to wait for it to recharge. The animations are very dated and the main character moves like a snail. It gets boring and repetitive very fast. It may entertain for a few hours but trying to finish it is a chore.. AWESOME what an amazing really goodgame. Fun shooter and fun j-horrorto the genre. A solid old school shooter. It's not trying to do too much and pulls off what it is doing quite well. I pretty quickly understood why the game gets mentioned and complemented on the enemy AI. They take cover, they flank, they're pretty accurate and pose a very real threat in most encounters. I couldn't get the idea of this being Half Life plus horror out of my head. Some of the level design, shooting, physics, and movement felt very like that of HL. All in all, a pretty solid horror fps, that both makes you feel very powerful at times yet still manages to keep my hair standing up at times. I am a mega scaredy cat when it comes to horror and I did ""okay"", not super friendly, but not too in your face. It does need a couple easy tweaks to play well on modern hardware.. First some good things, really good Ai even for today. The Graphics are also good for 2005 and the controls aren't bad, nothing special. I really don't know what is happening in the story, you follow one guy and more I don't know. The game feels like a mix between Doom 3, a new guy have to fight against some randomn enemys on his own. The other part of the mix is a generic shooter. This game is nothing special,if I have to discribe it in on sentence I would say: It is like Doom 3, but Enemys have guns and they are smarter.. I don't understand how it is possible to make a game like this in 2005. Its artificial intelligence is smarter than most people I know and it often feels like it is reading your mind, but despite this, it offers a very balanced difficulty. IT IS DEFINITELY A GAME THAT EVERYONE SHOULD TRY AT LEAST ONCE.. Truly amazing. The feeling of shooting in slow-motion with the shotgun is just superb. It's a shame we don't get games like this anymore. True, the story is obviously a b-movie plot, but the way they have carried it forward with the cinematics, you just have a keen interest on what's going to happen next. The A.I. of the enemies are also outstanding. Definitely a must try!!. Graphics: 7/10; Storyline: 7/10; Gameplay: 9/10; Atmosphere: 8/10; Music: 8/10; Summary rating: 8/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good athmosphere and horror environment, combat changes with every encounter, great graphics even for it's release date, the gameplay becomes a little repetitive after the final hours of gameplay.. The first of its kind, F.E.A.R. is high regarded as one of the best FPS games ever, and I do agree with that! Very good level design, art direction and pretty fun action packed combat.. The game **** at scaring you, and if the scares don't work it turns out to be mostly a corridor shooter but with quite good AI and decent gun mechanics. I can't leave a negative because this is a review from 2023, for 2005 this is an epic level of technical achievement that can be felt whilst playing, it's quite eye opening just how bad some newer games are at AI and gun play. The game becomes repetitive by around interval 5, it loses all of it's magic if any it had to start with. There is zero difficulty to any enemy engagement if you are around average or above average at shooting with a mouse. I played on medium difficulty and thought I was playing in a hospital because there were so many med packs and I was always full of them, I also forgot I had a slow-mo feature because enemy encounters were that easy. Other than that though? yeah it's a run of the mil shooter campaign not bad and by today's standards not good either.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Top notch firefights with cinematic melee and legs! One of the two best AI ever made for a first-person. And the horror ""how not to do"". (extreme difficulty; no explosives, no first-aid kits, no slo-mo) Gameplay: combat mechanics 10/10 combat logic 9/10 atmosphere [mystical/radio trashtalk, bad levels] 6/10 Gameplay as immersive horror [mystic is a trash] 5/10 Story [mystical trash is awful] 2/10 Graphics [all-grey] 9/10 Sounds & music [psi-trashtalk, absurd ambient] 7/10 . The very last Monolith PC production. RIP, PC-FPS development.. The original F.E.A.R is probably one of the best horror shooters around. Jump scares still hold up in 2023. Story is amazing and smooth. i remember as a kid i couldnt play this game in the dark, and it still holds that factor 14 yrs later at 27.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. F.E.A.R. delivers heart-pounding scares, a haunting atmosphere, and an engaging story. Its unique blend of horror and FPS make it a great horror game.. Pros.: - For a time being, it was a legit shooter with elements of horror. - Bullet time in FPS. - Smart enemies, flanking you. - Legit story and characters. Cons.: - Boring music. - Occasionally poor level design. As if the game was cut. - Plot holes.. 10 April 2023 So far, no shooter has been created better than F.E.A.R. and that's not surprising since the developers have stopped paying attention to physics, destructibility, AI, interactive objects, and the sheer fun of gunfights.. Pretty well aged shooter, a bit repetitive but still fun. good atmosphere over all. if you like games like condemned or call of cthullu you should give this a go or vice versa.. I've never finished the campaign as I hate horror games, but we played F.E.A.R. LAN multiplayer last weekend with the boys and I must say it's perfect! Highly reccomend.. Good old game. With beautiful graphics, an interesting plot and good shootings. But alas, there are critical flaws. The game is very corridor, and the locations themselves are not diverse. The first half of the game is clearly stronger than the second. Some characters in the game are simply not needed. The story itself leaves more questions than answers.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game for the standards in 2005, is incredible! They really did a good job here adding not only a fantastic horror story but implement and take bullet time to the next level. I was 15 when this game was released and I can remember being scared, intrigued and loving the excellent combat! Admittedly it's not great in 2022 (at the time of writing this) but still pretty darn fun actually. You can see how cool and technically built it was back then, but it is very old. You have to be willing to allow yourself to enjoy old games to like it, but I think you should. This is a must play and a great addition to the books of gaming history.. Graphics 7/10 Sounds 8/10 Gameplay 8/10 Story:6/10 Classic game, i love experience this game. FEAR Definitive! It's amazing how in 2005 this game has such good physics and perfect artificial intelligence! One of the best I've seen in my life. It's a very good game over the years. The quality of artificial intelligence does not exist today. Don't play the sequels. You can play dlc.. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME RANK : 76 IIIIIIIIII====================. The mid-game drags could have been trimmed down for a more polished experience, but F.E.A.R will nevertheless guarantee you a good time.. Looking back at the time this game was released, it was a really good game that guaranteed me hours of fun and fear! I remember being scared during several moments of FEAR. The atmosphere of the game for that time I consider to have been very good and engaging!. F.E.A.R. was an absolute classic that, at least within its own genre and series, has yet to be dethroned, but is it quite as remarkable as people remember it? I played F.E.A.R. or ""First Encounter Assault Recon,"" -which doesn't really roll off the tongue as well as the accronym, but I digress- way back in 2006 and you can for sure bet I barely had a computer that could run it at the time. Of course over the years that issue has been made null and void, but coincedentally what was once difficult to run on older hardware has become even more difficult to run on modern hardware for various reasons. Let me just rip off the bandaid here for anyone who's still too hardheaded to admit it: F.E.A.R. is not as good as we all remember. The first hour? Pretty great, but even after multiple playthroughs the entire Armacham office is a total blur and I don't care how many times someone reminds me what the last few levels were, because I could not recall them from memory without watching a video or reading a synopsis. F.E.A.R. as a game is weak in areas that at the time we weren't too upset about. Doom 3 had come out the year before, as well as Half-life 2, the latter remaining probably the best (but not perfect) shooter from that decade, though F.E.A.R.'s first foray still collects accolades for its particular blend of combat. For one, its like May Payne, SHOGO and Half-life had a baby, but this baby also inherited every trope, cliche, and stereotype from whatever pop culture thing was relevant when it came out. Creepy ghost girls? Check. Nerdy fat slob who secretly betrays you? Check. Generic black uniformed enemies with very little variation? Check-a-roo, and lets not forget the slowmotion ""effect"" that was slapped onto the game because hit-scan guns from enemies were the go-to method back then and are what probably gave people the impression that the A.I. in this game was mildly intelligent. The game was always a hodge-podge of very marketable generic FPS trends and features a very lackluster line-up of weapons that feel good to shoot, but lack the inventiveness of even the heavily criticized Half-life 2 or Halo series. The levels are very linear, featuring barely any twists or turns, though they have slightly different routes, but those are just hallways that happen to meet at some other junction. As far as the game play is concerned, its great fun, or was really enjoyable at the time, but now it can be absolutely blown right through when you realize how bad the A.I. actually is and how much they CHEAT to locate you in most instances. The enemies always know where the pointman is, but they pretend they don't due to the way they're programmed to engage you. Now remember, this game occasionally gets huge compliments in the AI department and this was even after the original Halo made large maps accomplishing the very same thing years before F.E.A.R. saw the light of day. The list of dumb advantages that make the game moderately unenjoyable later are mostly just the few beefcake enemies that have huge health pools and the big robot mechs you find later. The shooty-shooty-bang-bang was always entertaining and players will often reload quicksaves just to try things a little differently or maybe optimize gunfights or even experiment, but that is the experience people enjoyed about the game. Not the story, not the ""characters,"" not the voicemails, and certainly NOT the final boss fight (if you can even call it that). The sequels were so bad, I often wonder if they even had a good concept to begin with for any sort of overarching plot, and I'd go as far to say that the backdrop for the first game really only worked in the first game. Visually and aurally speaking, those were all knockout features in the game that really helped sell the atmosphere, though the jump scares are extremely archaic by today's standards and wore out their welcome after the first few times you happen to encounter them. The original F.E.A.R. game has a whole host of problems on newer machines, you have some graphical glitches, problems at higher frame rates, problems without V-sync on, mouse input issues that require a dinput fix, and the original EAX effects are somewhat broken even with Creative Alchemy's software ""restoration"" and it just kind of **** that the engine itself was so miserably proprietary (thanks Monolith- that's like every one of your titles). I know in my head how F.E.A.R. played, what it looked like, and sounded like way back when, so obviously it **** that I can't even play that version of it without weird issues. I know this comes down to subjectivity, but I think F.E.A.R. was kind of a one-off. It was a really remarkable game, not brilliant, but certainly had some of more memorable gunfights, though in my experience even the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series had more depth and more options in terms of how you could approach its combat scenarios.. AI at the time was very good, also kinda scary (but that mb bc I was 12 or smth),decent scenario+ spectacular gameplay, horror scenes if not scary right now but still feel good and artistic. Fear an amazing first-person shooter ,is one of the best of it's time and maybe all time, the only problem with the game it's the environment it kind of same i it should have garden maybe more interesting environment because I don't want to see office ever again in my life. But the shooting is phenomenal one one of the best shooting games ever made and I would recommend it to anyone it is truly satisfying and the shotgun is the best of using in any game. This game is sooo damn good, I remember I played this game when I was a 12 years old and that's my first scary games I ever played and I like though. the story and action is soo good. This game take place on my heart and this game atmosphere is soo cool. I want this series to continue or Remake, this game is a masterpiece.. One of the most Scariest games i ever played F.E.A.R is unlike anything you've seen the AI is what makes this game so much fun and the scares and music are the best part seeing the little girl in the game gave me the chills all i gotta say is it's better if you play this game in the Dark!. Really smart A.I., they do all kinds of tactics and I love how they behave In general just super exciting and difficult on harder. Great graphics for the year it released and amazing physics. Where this game flops and falls flat on its face is the level design and the horror, its really not scary and the level design is worse than Half-Life (1998), Its really dull and uninspired level design, just as the game gets good it suddenly gets very boring and bland because of the level design.. The horror scenes are so predictable they instantly break immersion because it does that transition into ""horror land"" and you know you cant get hurt in the horror land because its just like a flash back or something... This feels like a very long tech demo to show off its AI and great graphics and physics. 6/10 - Some excellent AI, probably the best ever seen In a video game, held back by its claustrophobic and very flat level design... A generic FPS. Mix Counter Strike and Half Life, and this is what you'll get. imo the best single player FPS ever made. The AI is so well made you feel like you are playing against real people, the gunplay and sound are awesome. The levels and art are the most boring thing anyone could think of yet they feel completely unique and fit the game like a glove. The story is cool and told in a way that doesnt get on your way of enjoying playing the game.. F.E.A.R. plus its expansion packs Extraction Point, and Perseus Mandate, are some of the most intriguing games I've played. Horror was never a genre of games I could get into, however these games blend horror with great first person action. This game reminds me of a tech demo, but made into a very serviceable game. The story is not ever super clear, but its great piecing it together, and making sense of the world, and the crazy **** happening in it. Voice acting is done very well, and isn't cringy in any way. The atmosphere is just perfect, with the gray, and brown color scheme that just works. Gun fights consists of ricochets, sparks, smoking, intense gun fire that is a beautiful sight to see. However, one thing became pretty apparent, especially during the play throughs of the expansions packs: The padded out campaign. The story and action is usually drip feed when walking through the huge levels, and without the ability to run, it makes it slower going through the levels, and backtracking for equipment. Other than this complaint, F.E.A.R. is a great game. A must have for PC players!. F.e.a.r is a game in which I had a lot of fun playing and had a great experience, the enemies are very smart knowing how to deal with you in different situations.. horror and action wonderfully mixed with a good story to make a memorable game, there is a multiplayer included for free. F.E.A.R. is one of the all time greatest first person shooters. That is something I believed back in 2005 and something I still believe now. It has some of the most satisfying combat I have ever had the satisfaction of playing and one of the best uses of slow mo I have seen next to Max Payne. There are plenty of weapons to choose from and all are fun to use in their own way. Every firefight just felt like pure unadulterated fun. The story is fantastic and one of the few times I would say it would be movie worthy without much if any changes needed. The graphics were top notch for their time. Blood; gore; facial detail; dust and smoke particles in gunfights; shadows; lighting; it was all mind blowing. The soundtrack was well done especially in the intro which is one of the finest intros I have ever seen. The voice acting is great all around. The storytelling devices were well sued as you can find laptops with backstory; find voicemails with current info as well as news reports that shed light on how the story is effecting the city. The AI was also some of the best I have seen and that is still true today sadly. The enemies work as a group; communicate about your strategy as well as to each other; they try to flush you out and flank you. The gaming world has had fifteen years to advance enemy AI in games and few if any have taken steps to even be as good as F.E.A.R. let alone better. The only criticisms I can offer are that I would have liked more info on just how Alma got her powers and what happened to Jankowski. I also think the game lacked a true end confrontation; it felt a bit out of place compared to the previous 8 hours of play. In this most recent play through I played F.E.A.R. on Linux using Wine and Lutris. It did crash on me one time with an error stating “out of memory” but other than that ran without issue and the performance was great. The game has twenty graphics settings; two AA options; and six AF options. Alt-Tab worked. You could pause and skip cut scenes. You could manually save whenever you wanted and there were ten save slots to do so or you could let the game simply save at checkpoints. You could change the difficulty at any time. The game does have some odd physics at times where bodies will rag doll off the ground even after death. I’m not sure if this is an issue with Wine or something that is just a game issue.

It is the total package of graphics; AI; game play and sound. The pacing was done well. It took me eight hours and nine minutes to beat the game on the extreme difficulty setting which didn’t feel too long nor rushed. I originally paid $56.48 CAD for F.E.A.R. when it first released. It retails for $12.89 CAD at the time of writing this. I can honestly say it is worth whatever they wanted to charge for it. I thought $56.48 was fair and I would think $100 was fair if they asked it of me.

[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best shooters ever created in this world. Change my mind! Topographic cretinism simulator. After all, only in these corridors you will spend a lot of time to find an exit from one location to another. Urrrhhh!!!. MASTERPIECE! Game was developed to feel like you are a movie star. It looks very realistic and well even on full hd! Great AI and level design. It is not like horror game, more like psychological thriller in japanese style. Mainly heavy combat focused and with slow mo. Absolutely beatiful physics and effects. This game needs remaster on VR. It would be stunning on VR! Story is also good, you have to pick out small details to understand it, which is hard sometimes, when characters are speaking there is noise, but it is mainly combat focused, very quick pacing and absolutely EPIC fights! This is must play for everyone. This is that kind of FPS, that revolutionized the genre and is original! Now what do we get? Give your kids FEAR instead of Fall guys! They need to play real games! To not become gaming zombies... I played this when i was 10.... I've been meaning to replay F.E.A.R. for quite a while and I'm glad that I enjoyed it just as much as I did, back when I first played. While it didn't age VERY well, it still plays like a charm, owing a lot to the first Half Life. Love it or hate it, F.E.A.R., alongside RE4, is one of the best games to blend horror and action together. It's a little more action oriented than it should, but its suffocating creepy atmosphere and ominous pacing keeps you on your toes. You never know if you're going to get jumpscared by a terrifying little girl or shot by a dozen heavy armored replica soldiers. It seems weird and it kinda is, but it works! I believe that half of the reason why it works is due to its strange story. It a mystery told in 11 chapters that still grips me to this day. It's not INCREDIBLY well-written, but it's engaging. It made me want to get to the ending and uncover whatever the hell was happening in the Origin project. Alma, Fettel and even you, the silent protagonist, are driving forces in a quiet story that, in my opinion, did not disappoint. Gameplay is also quite competent. Weapon variety is good, using SlowMo gives you a huge boost in combat, guns are impactful and the action is way more tactical than I remembered. Enemy variety ****, but the AI compensates, since they constantly try to flank you, react to your actions and force you to play smart to get to the next area. And while the game might be challenging, it plays so nice that I love how accessible it is for anybody to just pick up and shoot. One other thing that I LOVE is the sound design. Horror games usually nails this, but F.E.A.R. took it to another level. Do play this with a headset, please! F.E.A.R.'s biggest enemy is the level design. I usually prefer linear games than sandbox/open-world ones, but this is a perfect example of linear design gone terribly wrong. Levels are a repetitive, unimaginative and bland hallway fest. Some corridors feel like labyrinths. I got lost so many times on some areas that I just got bored! The pacing is not bad, but its straightforward nature hurts how well the game could hold up nowadays. I may love the story, but MY GOD does it take its time to unfold. You're basically left in the dark for the first 7 chapters, with minimal information and the same objective. And It's not like they did not have anything to reveal, they just decided to wait and rush it by the end. I love the final chapters, but if the game just focused in telling the story and frightening you more than throwing more enemies in the way, it would be much better. Also, whose idea was to make the flashlight so annoying? And why are there MECHS in the game? They feel so out of place... F.E.A.R.'s problems did not break the game in any way for me. This is still an amazing hair-raising experience. It's easy to recommend this to anyone, since it works so well as an fps and as a horror game. Sure, it didn't age like a fine wine, but it does its job of keeping you hooked and terrified.. I don't care what you have to say, this game had some of the best shooting mechanics and graphics at the time. And it was very very immersive.. The F.E.A.R. game is still playable in 2020 at Windows 10 after FPS fix applied. There is also fix for a too small subtitles on high resolutions, so... have fun after 15 years from the game's premiere :) From what I think you will most likely buy the main game with two DLCs in one purchase nowadays.. Nice old school shooter. If you looking for a long, fast game, to kill enemies in slow motion while their blood splashes everywhere, this is the one for you. Currently you can find it very cheap with it's expansions and sequels. Tens of hours of good old classic shooting game for less than 5€.. Good FPS with time dilation feature. Good combat vs this replicas soldiers. that's all.. Best horror game, not obviously spooky but tense in a good way, excellent gameplay, only weakness is enemy variety.. This game is frequently hailed as one of the only truly scary FPS games made. A game rich in atmosphere, and setting, that drives you to keep playing it. I just don't see it. I have tried to get into this game. I want to like it. But I just can't. I can't now, and I couldn't ten years ago when it first came out, the first time I tried to play it. Nothing in the game, nothing in the story, makes me want to keep playing. That is not to say the game doesn't have its strong points. The AI in this game is top notch, and holds up well even today. The enemies will try to flank you, surround you, they react to being seen, being shot at. They'll throw grenades, they'll fire from cover. They really are some of the best AI I have ever seen. And the game should be played if just for this alone. (Edit: This only applies to the first enemy type you see, the soldiers. When you start getting to the invisible robot ninjas (I am not kidding), the good AI goes right out the window. I witnessed two of them performing a Scooby-Doo routine of running back and forth randomly between the rooms in a hallway, simply because I had my gun pointing down the hallway so they wouldn't come at me. It was hilariously pathetic.) But there are also problems. There's no on-screen indication when you take a hit. Your life goes down, and that's it. So you could be in a fire fight, shooting from cover, and thinking you're doing well, only to find yourself on the edge of death. Because you didn't know that the enemy was hitting more shots than not. Or didn't realize that someone had gotten to your side, and was free to open up on you. That severely hurts this game. (Edit: There actually IS a visual indicator. But it is on the very edge of the screen, and flashes by so quickly that I literally did not notice it for more than three hours of gameplay.) They also made a bizarre choice with the weapon and ammo mechanic. In an effort to make you switch weapons often (you can only carry three at a time), when picking up a new weapon it comes with a full magazine loaded, and enough ammo for a second. However, if you already have a weapon of that type, when you pick the new one up for more ammo, you get roughly a third of a magazine. Of course, you can game this system by first tossing your weapon on the ground, picking up the new one (which is now reloaded for you), and then picking up your old one with all the ammo you had before. You'll start to do this very rapidly once you find a weapon you like. Also, despite being only ten years old, the game does not run well on modern systems. Disabling ""HID-Compliant Device"", and in my case ""HID-Compliant Vendor-Defined Device"" is required to make the game run at anything higher than 6-7 FPS. So don't expect your gaming keyboards and mouse to function when you play this game, and be prepared to reenable those when you have finished. There are other problems. The game forces ""Letterboxing"" when it does cinematics. Even if you're using a wide-screen monitor and resolution. So expect to see black bars and the top and bottom of an already wide-screen image. And the FMV cut-scenes are letterboxes as well, but set in 4:3 ratio, so they'll be displayed with a box with black bars on all sides. So what about the story? Well, this was before the ""scary little girl"" trope was completely overplayed. But even so, nothing in this seems to work. There's a few pseudo jump-scares, and some places where the graphics will change on you into another, ""spooky"" scene. But both Max Payne and even Postal 2 of all things had done this years before. (Quick edit: The Postal 2 expansion that featured this was released the same year as F.E.A.R., but five months before.) And to a better effect. In fact, that might be one of the problems I had with this game ten years ago. It so desperately wants to play like Max Payne, but with a horror twist (""Bullet Time"" - the slow motion effect - was featured in Max Payne as well). But this game just didn't seem to push hard enough. There's a level of interactivity... but it's so painfully limited that you notice more when you CAN'T do something than when you can. You can only do anything with phones if they're already flashing with a voice mail message. You walk by a radio and can't turn it on yourself, but some will spout something directly from the Exposition News Network, letting you know a plot update... and then promptly fall silent again. There are blocked doors, sometimes you can figure out a way to open them, but frequently they can't be. And, again, to put in perspective as to the environment when this game came out, System Shock 2 and Deus Ex had both been out for half a decade before this game was released. The game shows its age now. But it wasn't fresh and exciting when it came out. F.E.A.R. - First Encounter Assault Recon (which, BTW, Assault and Recon are kinda mutually exclusive, but they had to fit that name in somehow) was a game that was trying to just exist.. The configuration is very good. You can play with most computer. Graphics are very good for this year. The Artificial intelligence is amazing.. The Slo-mo powers were unique. Unfortunately, I played on Xbox trying to get the achievements, so I was forced not to use them just for an achievement. But these powers makes the game ",a pretty decent on the rails shooter that lacks variety in combat and environments . the story seems interesting at first but loses its impact after a few hours . the animations are very dated and the main character moves like a snail .
536.Psychonauts,"This game succeeds at making a compelling story with unique and mostly memorable levels the best being levels such as one of the greatest oat the milkman.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An incredible, unique, and recommended experience. Visually stunning and creative.. this is literally the worst game I've ever played. like I don't even dislike any games. except this one. **** this game. firstly every single mf in this game is the most annoying asswipe in the world and having to hear all of them back to back to back makes me wanna blow my brains out. also the controls are janky as **** and moving the stupid ass camera around the character is so godamn annoying because it never does what u want it to do. this game is also absolutely terrible at telling you wtf to do in a level. it'll just say something like ""grab the hedge trimmers"" and throw u in a massive ass level. WHERE TF ARE THE HEDGE TRIMMERS U CAN'T JUST GIVE ME VAGUE ASS INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPECT ME TO FIGURE OUT WTF IS GOING ON IM NOT J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER. also they'll give you these tools to use but never tell you when and how to use them so you'll be stuck on a level running back and forth for an hour until u look up a walkthrough on youtube and then go ohhhh I was supposed to put on the night vision goggles to press a button in the fridge that then unlocks an item in the shop that you have to buy to continue the level. LIKE WTF IS THIS GAME DESIGN. they'll be parts in the game where I'd actually be having a bit of fun and then the game will go nope **** u and throw some stupid ass thing at u like having to use a metal detector to pick up 600 fictional currency before progressing. I tried. I gave this game many chances. but it's actually torture. **** the electric chair this is 10x worse. congress plz fix this game.. EN: Perfect! Game with the best dialogues. Great humor. The art design is beautiful and the levels are interesting. I'm excited for second part. SRP: Perfektno! Igra sa najboljim dijalozima. Odličan humor. Art dizajn je prelep i nivoi su zanimljivi. Radujem se drugom delu.. Psychonuts is weird because the gameplay it's average platformer but The Story, character, voice acting it's one of the best of PS2 Xbox generation and you can really feel the heart behind every detail in the game, but why is the gameplay average? Because the character you play as feel way to stiff and when he jumps he falls down too fast you can get used to it absolutely, the best part is assumed you get the bubble his movement becomes way More good . The characters design is looks like some with Tim Burton cartoon stuff that I would have loved to watch as a child ,and all the small details that every character react to when your use psychic Powers and and you can use second sight to see what they think about you. I love this game even if is gameplay is a clunky mess. While the gameplay feels antiquated and a bit dry, the immersive environment, ingenious writing, and unique but charming characters will draw you in like no other game. Tim Schafer knocks it out of the park with this gem. I cannot wait for 2!. Game is fantasticly creative, fun and enjoyable! 100% recommendation. 12/10 as for me. :) Never played so good designed and well made with so many mechanics and fun things to do game before.. It visually holds up. In terms of its narrative and characters, it far exceeds any other 3d platformer I've ever played. It's level and gameplay variety is impressive. One level in particular stands out as one of the most compelling and noteworthy that I've maybe ever played. Certainly for a game of this type. I feel it deals with what are often sensitive matters very well, even whilst still maintaining the game's charm. However, for a platformer, the platforming is not good. It's inconsistent, and the design of many of these platforming sections are confusing. In fact, I spent a great deal of the game confused. You get so many powers in the end that can all be utilised in various ways, it often feels as though you're forced through a period of trial and error to figure out what the game wants of you. It's where the signature Double Fine - let's face it, ridiculous - puzzles begin to be problem for me. Mixed in the platforming and combat, it can be frustrating. Also, despite the quirky dialogue, it's never very funny - though this really is subjective. It's a fun game but also it's missing a lot of polish. Definitely worth going back to if you love 3d platformers though.. Psychonauts getting stuck in your mind Psychonauts is an 8 and a half hour long 3D platformer where you play as raz.. youre a psychis and youre at this camp to hone your psychic abilitites and become a psychonaut… and I absolutely loved this game from start to finish.. it feels like youre in an interactive cartoon from the late 90s or early 2000s, the humour, the voice actin, the perasonality of every character in the worlds.. I absolutely loved it… eventually brains strat getting snatched up so youll be going on a journey to get them back.. and along the way youll need certain items to progress and to get those items you have to teleport into the minds of different charatcers and deal with their demons, their insecurities, really anything that’s holding them back emotionally.. and every mind feels unique.. this is ultimately a 3d platformer with light combat aspects.. youll unlock new psychic abilities as the game goes on,giving you new ways to interact with the world… but no 2 levels feel the same, and I love that especially for a 3d platformer… every level here is memorable, youll be faced with different obstacles and problems to solve, and I love it.. one moment youll be floating through the air and rolling on a ball, and the next youre inside of a board game… the only issues psychonauts has is that it is in ways. But only in a couple of ways stuck in time.. I did have to check a walkthrough a couple of ytimes to figure out where to go or what im supposed to be doing to do damage to a boss.. as in a good and bad way.. bosses are all different and cant be damaged in the same way.. this is great when it comes to boss variety, but I feel I would’ve appreciated some cinsistancy in this aspect of the game.. especially since dying will cause you to restart the battle completely, and there are multiple stages and the way to damage the boss isn’t even consistent within its own battle… overall though psychonauts is pure nostalgic magic, this over 15 year old game is worth going back for before the sequel comes out. I give Psychonauts an 8.5/10. A lot of people are giving it a 10 but I'm giving it a 9. The game is still great don't get me wrong! It is just the game is a little annoying but besides that the game would have been perfect.. A quirky, original and astounding platformer, and it holds up 8 years later. It's got the most clever, funny writing I've seen in a game, and with innovative ideas, like sortings ones literal emotional baggage and jumping into peoples brains that match their personality, that are executed perfectly. Granted, the platforming itself is a bit off, as this is Tim Schafers first stab at puzzle platforming, but the characters, writing, aesthetic, adventure and story are completely pitch perfect, and it's one of the best 3D platformers of all time, even though the platforming isn't as tight as other platformers. It's a shame this didn't sell well, because if it did, more developers would be focusing on story and characters than xenophobic shooty-fun.. Certainly doesn't have amazing graphics but it does have a good art style. The gameplay is... a bit bland and clunky. I can't give this more than a 8, it's just not that well. Fun.",the controls are janky as **** and moving the stupid ass camera around the character is so godamn annoying . the game is absolutely terrible at telling you wtf to do in a level . i tried many chances but it's actually torture .
537.The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"I just signed up to give LOTR: Power of Rings a ""0"" rating. While I'm at it, I wanted to give this a 10 as well.. 500 hours in, deadgod achieved, know every bit of trivia about the game and still wanting to learn more, not my favorite roguelike but just for the replayability and the mass exposureit has made for the genre i got to give it a perfect score. Might be a little hard to get into now if you know nothing about the game.. Amazing roguelike. The only problem is that you can't read the items descriptions during a run if you're playing the console version. There are hundreds of items, so you really need a way to read what each item does.. by far one of the best roguelikes out there, much to the chagrin of roguelike purists, definitely a must play. it would be a ten and its a really good game but spider-man isn't in it. This game is a masterpiece. It's kinda hard but if you put a few hours into it you WILL get addicted. It is the KING of Rouge-likes and it's really fun. If you have around 15 bucks to spare this is hella worth it. Also a short tip: Play the game until you get experienced before you buy the DLC's. Especially before you buy Repentance because this **** hard. Also another Tip before buying any of the DLC's: MAKE SURE THAT YOU BOUGHT AFTERBIRTH BEFORE BUYING AFTERBIRTH + AND AFTERBIRTH + BEFORE REPENTANCE. This is because Afterbirth + expands Afterbirth and Repentance expands Afterbirth +. Do this so you don't have to complain. My conclusion: BUY IT!. Fun and challenging rogue-like where I get something new to happen every run. A good time waster! Graphics look nice and crisp on the PS4 too. The only downside of the game is that most items don't come with a description of what they do, but it's not a big deal since there are various useful websites to look these up on.. It's a fun dungeon crawler/rougelike. Coming back to it after a few years I realized it wasn't nearly as hard as I previously thought but still it's great.. Update they finally fixed there **** meaning i can rate this game a solid 10 No support for PS4 in 3 years. Still no trophy fixes or any fixes at al SHAME ON THE DEVELOPERS would have giving it a 10 otherwise.. Addicting fun and replayable!!!!! I am obsessed with this game and have not got bored since I downloaded it. Very challenging at the begining but also very satisfying to play and quite funny. The best rogue like i have played.. I am absolutely addicted to this game. It's been so satisfying to learn how all the items work and try new tactics. Pretty difficult to learn at the beginning but so addictive, that you won't even notice playing it for hundreds of hours. Randomized levels, great variety of opponents and countless items combinations make this game an endless experience. Totally a must-play!. Is one of the best, maybe the best Roguelike I've ever played in my life. The story, the characters, the gameplay, the design, is all done perfectly.. Simply addicting. The best rogue-like in the business. I've played for at least 600 hours yet, and i never feel tired of it. I will post this review for the PS4 version since it was the first one I played, but it also applies for the VITA, Switch, and PC as I have played them all and they're pretty much all on the same level as well. Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is by far my favorite indie game of all time and also the finest, most unique Rogue-like game I ever had the pleasure to play. Make no mistake about this game. It might look like a silly and innocent game but the rabbit hole stretches deep and there is a lot about this gem than meets the eye. I will start by speaking about the gameplay. The core mechanics are quite simple and the game while challenging seems pretty easy to follow, but soon enough you will get your way blocked by secrets and hidden features you have to figure out by yourself. The RNG and all the items make for some unique and diverse runs so the game can remain interesting even after 300 hours of gameplay. My main issue about the Binding of Isaac is just its randomness. While this is one of its greatest assets it also proves to be a double-edged sword at times as one run can get ruined by extreme unluck or lack of keys/bombs, etc. There is a lot of different characters each with their own level of challenge and unlockables and on the PC version, you can even extend that list with countless modded characters. Now we're talking about Binding of Isaac's major strength in my opinion and what makes it such a distinctive game compared to other Rogue-like games. BoI does not only deliver one of the most addictive gameplay in the genre but it also delivers a very intriguing and vague story the player can try to figure out. There are many theories and it all ties to religion. The game that at first looks silly and even innocent is actually a game with important themes and a ton of religious symbolism. By the end of the story, it's up to the player to interpret what truly happened to Isaac and his family. One thing is certain, be the gameplay or the vague yet effective visual story-telling, Binding of Isaac is a game that won't leave your memory.. As someone who has played probably 200-300+ (there's no way to check in-game, sadly), this is probably the best top-down rogue-like dungeon shooter you are probably ever going to play. Completing a single run can be difficult, but completing two separate runs without ever being hit (as I had to do, now this is much easier due to a change to the character's starting items) is another story. My stats say that I have completed the game approx. 150 times, but I have only COMPLETED the game once. Unlocking and picking up ever active/passive item/trinket (~340 total), unlocking all the secrets (~270), and completing all 20 challenges to earn the ""Real Platinum God"" trophy was a journey filled with so many different emotions that I was happy to continue until its conclusion. Just like with the Dark Souls games and many other cult classics as this, many players will be turned off by the difficulty and high learning curve, however, those willing to invest some effort (and time) into the game will be the ones who tell you that there is tons hidden lore and sense of accomplishment experience within.. Very unique. Simple, but unique. Very diverse and an extremely good enemy/boss design. The items are also superb, and I have easily sunken hundreds of hours into this game.. An excellent game with literally hundreds of hours of content, a HUGE amount of different items offering layers and layers of gameplay modification. Every run is completely different, and the gameplay loop is amazingly addictive. Definitely a 'just one more run' type of game. The game also has multiple paths, endings and twists, and just as you think you've seen everything it will throw something new at you. One gripe is not having a clue what some of the items do, as it doesn't usually say in-game - I ended up downloading an unofficial app to look up items and understand how to use them. Also, it can be heavily luck-based, as one run can have you feeling god-like powerful, while the next can have you struggling with basic enemies, completely dependant on the items dropped. However this I suppose can be expected from a procedurally-generated rogue-like game. Definitely recommended to pick up, and as good as the base game is, if you also pick up the Afterbirth+ expansion, or buy the complete edition available, this only makes it even better, with tons and tons more items, enemies, bosses and more.. Awesome little time filler with countless combinations in terms of power ups and levels. It might be a bit offensive to some but you can never please everyone all the time. The levels are randomly generated as well as the loot so it makes for some very interesting and constantly different play through.. I've lost hours in this game from the moment I got it. This is a rogue like done 100% correctly. Should you get this game you will be surprised at the amount of depth in this game. You will have lucky runs, you will have unlucky runs and you will hit walls where you die 15 times in a row.. This is what happens when you get a bunch of white infants on LSD and throw them in a scary, haunted, satanic maze.. I have sunk over 1000 hours on this game, between PS4 & PC. If you enjoy a top down, rouge-like, randomly generated challenge then this game is for you. Each time you play it's different, the ability to try new builds and tweak your play style is endless. The creator (Edmund McMillen) and developer (Nicalis) have given this game the loving tweaking required. This along with developing updates with user mods being applied as now patched items. After 4 years the game is still showing why it's one of the gods of indie.. Possibly my favorite Indie game of all time. The atmosphere is grim, the game is highly addictive, the game is brutal and just pure fun. Plus the game is highly replayable.. Super addicting game, I like it very much. I just think it's very unfortunate that everything is so gross and ugly. Blood, poop, aborted fetuses... well if it's your thing (!!!??) you will be pleased. The same game in a different setting would have been so much better in my opinion. Definitely DON'T let your kids play this game. I was a bit disappointed by the coop mode, as the 2nd player cannot choose his character, cannot pickup items or cash and have less health than first player. Otherwise I have nothing negative to say. The game is very challenging, the rooms are randomly generated, there are plenty of original items, secret rooms, great boss battles, tremendous replayability... and it's just very, very fun.. Idk i just dont know. I admit i havnt played that much. Maybe im here too early. I just Dont get the high praise. Maybe im missing something. Since its a twin stick im gona hav 2 compare it to geowars 3. It just seems like a baby toy compared to that. Its already down by the bottom of the library just because i hav way more games im interestd in. If i ever figure it worth more than a 5 ill let u know. Kinda of a funny little grotesque perversion world though and atleast it works u know since some of the high $ crap dont even work these days. Edit - Totally Didn't give this game a chance at first. It is good, going on great! My mistake! 9.25 rescore! Awesome! The End.. This is a really fun game. First game I ever platinum'd. It is short in duration from start to finish, so the daily commitment isn't grueling like some other games - I can usually start and finish a game in under an hour. Almost everything about the game is different each time one plays (rogue-like), which makes it a real hoot. The biggest problem I have with the game is that it crashes when playing on the PS4 - this happens a lot during the Daily Challenge which is extremely frustrating and disappointing. Other than that, it's one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life (been playing video games since the 80's.). A fantastic, deep, difficult, and time consuming game. It really brings me back to those feelings of frustration I had playing these kinds of games as a kid. It's a game that has be coming back two years post-release. Everything from the gameplay to the soundtrack are top notch.. I have played probably close to 1000 hours of this game and I'm still not completely finished with it. What more do you want from a game then good fun that last for hours and hours? The game has a difficult learning curve but if you allow yourself enough hours, you will discover a very deep game play system. There are always goals and things to unlock which keeps you coming back for more. Fantastic game!. A rouge-like that tasks the player with traversing randomly generated 2d dungeons from an isometric viewpoint the art work, difficulty and twisted sense of humour make it clear from the outset that this from Edward McMillen, creator of the well-received Super Meat Boy. Overall I didn’t enjoy it quite as much as the precision platforming of Meat Boy but the fast paced gameplay and huge variety of enemies and power ups, meaning there always seems to be something new discover, certainly gives it that ‘one more go’ factor and provided me with a fair few hours of entertainment.. Far and ahead one of the biggest sleepers on the PS4 and video games in general. This is a random dungeon crawler with A LOT going on. I was really surprised at how much thought has gone into this game, especially with all the biblical references. I can't wait until the expansion comes to the PS4.. This is the absolutely best rogue like I have ever played and still do. And enjoy as well. At first the concept is a bit confusing. In it's base the game is a top down shooter where you progress from room to room, beat the boss of that floor and move on to the next. This is all backed up by a rather strange story and game is heavily influenced by bible mythos though twisting and bending it for it's own purpose. You go through different floors, picking different items that you have no idea what they do. Things get unlocked, paths of the game change. You beat one boss, another one gets unlocked. Whole floors get unlocked even. But with every play you learn something new - how to fight a certain boss, what a certain item does and how to find things you had no idea existed just a few plays ago. And it's so addictive. Some runs are hard and frustrating, other with a right combination of items become a walk in the park and it's so enjoyable. Items, and there is a lot of them, synergies with one another creating great combos and combinations. The replay value of this game is just mind boggling. And the community around the game is both great and large. Definitely recommend that game as it's the best in this category.. It's a very simple, addictive game which has a lot of content. If you've never played The Binding of Isaac before, then you are definitely missing out. This is a rogue-like game with a lot of features that will remind you of classics such as the first Legend of Zelda game, and it definitely works well in complimenting the game and its absurd plot.. An overrated and over hyped game that comes as a cook recipe for teenagers, p** and p**p gags+gore+baby hero=choking sensationalism all-rounder. Hipsters and dumbsters have really questionable tastes sometimes.. The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is my go-to game when I want something familiar but new. Detach yourself from the subject matter and it's great dungeon-crawler with lots of replayability.. Let me start off this review by saying how i absolutely LOVE this game. in the first few playthroughs i was immediately hooked and have continued playing it periodically since i got it from the playstation store. the graphics are awesome and remind me of a snes zelda game that is just a tad bit darker (maybe a little more than a tad lol). the gameplay is amazing and playing each run definitely feels like an entirely new experience every time, whether you are extremely op or just getting the bare minimum to get by the game is always entertaining. also i have showed this game to everyone that would listen and seen them all love it as much as i do, so don't listen to the BS negative scores because this game is definitely not something you would want to pass up. 11/10 seriously. I have 300+ hours in this game and I'm still playing it and I don't think I'll be stopping anytime soon. This game is fun, challenging and almost infinitely re-playable.. Insanely addicting and probably my favorite Indie game ever made. Binding of Isaac is a fantastic roguelike twin stick shooter that is inspired by Legend of Zelda and is full of Biblical references. Sound strange? It gets way weirder than that. Go watch some vids to check it out and then buy it.. I already gave a 10/10 review for PS Vita version few months back after I first killed mom, thinking that the game is over, oh boy I couldn't have been more wrong. That was all just the start of another hundreds of gaming hours long adventure deeper into the depths. It shows how much longevity and replayability this game truly has. Months of real life spent on shooting **** with my tears. Beating the entire labyrinth with Lost character on hard without being hit a single time, challenges like these were pure hardcore experience. I finally got the platinum and it was a hell of an adventure. PS4 version is smoother in framerate, richer in details and allows local co-op, but on the other hand pixel artstyle of this game and overall feeling is still better suited for Vita. Both versions are fantastic and I'm glad that the Nicalis fiasco with broken trophies and SONY EU not patching it for months was already resolved. Overall, Issac Rebirth is one of the best rogue-like games and triumph of game design and hardcore gameplay. 10/10. What a fantastic little game. the depth and randomness to this game still has be playing off and on. It is one of those games where you do not need to play everyday but when you do play you're hooked in for an hour plus. The random levels and items really make the game a new experience everytime. Will you make it to Mother, Mother's Heart, Satan...Isaac? Or will you get owned by spiders in the first stage. You just never know. More games need to adapt this formula.. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a very big suprise for me. I expected to play a simply game but when i play, I became open-mouthed. TBOIR is a very good rogue like game, very addictive and funny. It looks great, also it have local coop, and hundreds of items to explore. A very real diamond for your consoles and Pc's that you can't left it forgotten. Game is so addictive. Quality indie title, if you like rogue-types and don't mind dying (A LOT), give it a shot. Its like Legend of Zelda, but grittier and more dark.. I'm updating my review because recently I have began to play The Binding Of Isaac:Rebirth again. I feel I wasn't really fair on the game at first. Partly because I didn't understand it. I believed it to be another cheap twin stick shooter. But now I've put in a good few hours I can see how deep the game is. In fact once you get past the first 1 hour of play, the game becomes highly addictive and keeps you coming back for more and more and more. I now feel this is one of the most fun, deep and interesting games I've downloaded from psn and I am thoroughly enjoying it.. There's too much to say about this game to fit in a 5000-character limit. Just take my word for it, buy this game! You will certainly not regret it. I would honestly rate this game higher than 10 if I could. Procedurally generated games like these are making waves in the gaming community as of recent, and for that and so many other reasons, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is heralded as one of the best games on the market place right now. And who am I to argue? This game is about discovery, and piecing together a disturbing story about a troubled young boy whose religious extremist mother neglects and isolates. Left to his own devices, Isaac gets lost in a dark and incendiary world of anthropomorphized poo (you heard me) and demons and such. Battling his conflating opinions about life and death, Isaac must decide which he's happier with. It's an engrossing and very challenging (sometimes frustrating) experience, and one not to be missed by any fan of good indie games.. Don't understand what I'm missing but this game is not the least bit interesting. A string of random dodge and shoot messes loosely tied together by disturbing (but not good or particularly intriguing) pixel drawings. It's like the people who make retro games today didn't actually play the games they're trying to emulate. I lost all interest in this game in the first 10 minutes. I played longer just to be fair due to all the hype, to make sure I wasn't missing something. I'm not. There's nothing here but the shallowest of gameplay.. I just cannot get into this style of game. I played better games than this 20+ years ago. Today, this game ought to come in a cereal box; there are mobile apps with more depth and better gameplay. I don't even know if 2D dodge and shoot should be called gameplay anymore. Sorry Isaac, lot of hype, zero game.. Binding of Isaac is the game that made me like roguelikes. It is unfortunate that as things have panned out, it's one of the only roguelikes I have thoroughly enjoyed. Binding of Isaac is retro arcade good times with unlockables to keep you working toward something and just enough of a bizarre, twisted story to keep you trying to piece things together. Simple, fluent controls stay simple until you happen upon one item that changes your whole play style, perhaps for the better or perhaps to your chagrin. I have scrapped a few runs from picking up items I just didn't want to deal with, but when you hit that sweet loadout and you're mowing things down like the tortured floating head of an angry god, this game can't be beat for triumphant satisfaction. A genuinely good skill challenge combined with the blessings or smitings of fate, Binding of Isaac is a game that deserves a look, and then a few-dozen hours of play. Truly a benchmark for indie gaming, and a reminder of what we can pick up from the past and improve through the future.. I'm a hater not a lover on Issac. The game is original and yes, it's different every reload, but that doesn't make it a great game. I think we have already seen much more fun rogue-like games on PS4, and as a PS+ freebie I gave this a day or twos efforts before removing it from my hard drive. It's just not that good for a PS4 title. I think had it been on iOs / android, I'd play this on my phone or tablet, but on a 55"" screen it seems like a real jump back to early games, but without the fun factor for me. I'm also not a hater cos of the graphics, but the art style is pretty boring when compared to say Darkest Dungeon (which I'm playing on my laptop at the moment) or the absolutely flawless ""Dont Starve"" which is easily the best indie title to hit PS+ to date, and I'd say the PS4 altogether. I'm really puzzled as to why this game is so loved. Buy it, see for yourself, but I'm glad I got this free and didn't pay for it, it wasn't for me.. Just recently I have not returned to a game that i have completed, thanks to the cross play feature I am able to play this game at home or on the go on my vita I got this game VIA the PS+ free game but if i knew just how good this game was I would have easily payed for it. The controls are basic Left stick to move and Right stick to shoot you can only shoot in 4 directions up down left and right (you can also use the X, square, triangle and circle in relation to which direction to shoot) but don't let that fool you this game wants you dead at first it seems easy but as you go deeper into Isaac's hell it will stop at nothing to kill you, very much like the many rouge likes before it you have to grind through the deaths to become good, I have played for many hours and I still die more times than I win but when you do the victory is all the more sweeter for it. There are tons of items to collect, hidden rooms and power ups to collect each play through has different items in different places each power up changes the way Isaac looks (in one play through Isaac was wearing mums underwear, moms heels and a ginger wig while the next I looked like the devil) sometimes the combinations over write each other but you still keep the benefits of the power ups. You collect pills from time to time these are one use items that give you benefits or negative effects but each play through the effects are switch so you never know what will happen you take the pill. There are more items that change how you play but I'll bore you no longer with descriptions of the items. Lastly the graphics are good not fantastic but the drawing are great you can quickly identify what you are fighting at a quick glance which can effect your approach to the room, now the atmosphere is the best i have come across, I didn't know much about this game i saw a few screen shots early on and thought it doesn't look special but upon playing I found a delightfully dark undertone to the whole game, it might look childish on the surface but once you start the game even the short intro just shows how dark the game is if you look beyond the drawings and take the atmosphere in you'll see a dark twisted world that begs to be explored.. Honestly, i absolutely love this game. i have poured countless hours into this and i am still unlocking trinkets and secrets. I never played the flash version, but followed enough videos to know that i would love this game. It is absolutely worth the purchase. DLC is in the works and it will make this even more extensive. My only complaint would be that sometimes i feel it ways too heavily on luck, although when you get lucky, it feels soooo good.. Deep, charming, and unforgiving are the three words I'd pick to summarize how I feel about this game. This game is phenomenal! It is a breath of fresh air. In a vast pool of games that hold your hand to ensure you win, this game throws you in there with little to no instruction or explanation of the various upgrades you can get. This game feels like an old Zelda title mixed with Smash TV. The randomly generated levels keep it fresh, and as you play more and more runs you unlock more and more stuff such as items, upgrades, and bosses. I'm still seeing new things in this game, and I'm closing in on my 100th run! The only reason it lost one point is because of the grotesque backdrop, but the reality is that I got used to all the poop trying to kill me (literally, poop). This game definitely has a dark, twisted side to it. Everyone's entitled to an opinion, and I'm not by any means degrading the negative reviews. This game won't be for everyone. The only reviews I will address are those comparing this to a story driven game such as The Last of Us. If you're looking for a compelling story, you are definitely in the wrong place.. Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is an amazing game, which offers tons of replayability for a reasonable price. It is highly recommended to anyone who wants to have a good time. Plus: The new DLC is coming out soon and offers even more replayability and more sweet goodness. For 15$ it's worth the price. I got Platinum on this game too. Way too fun. Addictiveness, strategy, and a tad of rage creates an amazing game. Tons of levels and different rooms combined with a load of random and unique items gives the player the choice of what strategy he or she wants to use when facing these rooms and bosses. The feel of accomplishment when destroying the toughest rooms and bosses are excellent. Of course after a while it does feel repetitive but coming back every now and then and the game will never get old.. Worthless game, it's so boring that it's funnier to sleep than play this game. The graphics is terrible and I can't understand the high rating, it's higher than mafia 2! Seriously, who likes this kind of games?. Cheesy and boring. Bad visuals. Just stay away from this game. Way overrated in my opinion. I know I played it for free from ps plus but I'm still bashing it.. Let me start off by saying that Edmund McMullin picked the right team to help with this version or remake of the original The Binding of Isaac and it's expansion. The game alone isn't something that you will get right away since it clearly is made with the intention of giving you that classic 8 bit difficulty and plenty of meme references and put you to make stressful decisions that may or may not benefit you in the long run. Anyone that has picked up this game may have a grudge against it and that's because this game will put you in some situations leaving you feel it's the games fault but in true retrospect, it's only your fault and this game makes you know that. Every time you pick up this game to play (either on your PS4 or Vita). Know that you will walk out playing this game knowing that you will get better every time. With that in mind, I love this game and I am excited for the DLC that will be coming out in the near future with more items and more everything.. Visually different but not much new in the game mechanics but with a very weird and unsettling plot. A mentally ill mother who listens to a voice in her head that she thinks comes from ""God"". This voice tells her to kill her own son. He manages to escape the abuse by going to the basement. From then on the child becomes more and more disturbed and dark. Really strange. The gameplay is old school static screen puzzler with few new twists; clear room, use bombs, find keys. This quickly becomes boring and repetitive. It's not all bad as the power-ups were quite fun as were the different outfits that represented them. That said these outfits add to the unsettling nature of the plot. They chart the toddler's decent into various mental disorders.. After 10 minutes of playing this game I hated it. It was super hard / frustrating. (Super Meat Boy level of frustration). However I kept finding myself coming back to it again and again. You could sink 100+ hours into it, complete many times but it offers so many different endings, new characters and bosses that makes you come back for more. This is easily one of my top games of 2014.. Those of you who read my reviews know I can get a little long-winded. Buy this game. Point blank. Any age can appreciate the crude references and simple yet addictive game-play that Isaac brings to the table. I actually said ""what the f***!?"" out loud more than I ever have in past gaming, this game is TWISTED. I mean the guys that made this have Mother issues twisted, and it works out just swell. What's left is a very blue comedy crafted shooter that uses procedural generated levels to make every new game feel like a brand new adventure. I was discovering new power-ups and bosses TENS OF HOURS into the game, and yes you will sink some time into this. The last 10 I gave was to Duke Nukem: Forever, which I stand by because it was exactly what it should have been. If you disagree, don't let my lofty evaluation deter you, this game is for anybody who wants to laugh so hard they cry, and enjoys the simple mechanics that was abundant in early consoles. 10/10. The Binding of Isaac is a sick game, a horrific game full of stomach churning moments that will, more than once, make you double take on whatever had just happened. It's grotesque and horrific, and it does it so very well. The story is similar to the tale in the bible of Isaac being bound and almost sacrificed by his father in the name of God, but with a more modern take and a twisted extension. The game itself is a dungeon crawler very reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda, just a lot more grotesque. The game will have you traversing between various rooms with their own little sick surprises or, occasionally, an item that will allow you along your way. I could go into detail about each room, each item, each **** that would defeat the object of the game entirely. I personally found that the game was meant as less of a challenge (although you'll get a lot of that, don't worry) and more of a kind of venture to investigate a disturbed world, to discover different secrets and hideous monsters and to uncover the best kind of strategies to pass through the game, taking the least amount of damage possible. I also find that the game is very luck based; if you don't get a great seed or a decent item towards the beginning, you may find yourself struggling a great deal. Fortunately, the game does allow you to view the seed code so that you may travel the same dungeon once again. I doubt the items will be generated in the same fashion (I haven't yet used the seed codes yet) but it may be worth it just to know where you're going and what you're doing. There are many different items, and you can review each one of them through several pages filled with each that you have come acros","i just signed up to give LOTR: Power of Rings a ""0"" rating . the only downside is that most items don't come with a description of what they do . if you put a few hours into it you WILL get addicted ."
538.NHL 10,"I bought this game two weeks ago at a retro video game store. Best 3 Bucks of my life. Coming from a person whose first NHL Game was NHL 08, I was blown away. I don't know if It's the nostalgia from NHL 08 and 09, or the Roster of greats from my childhood, but it was an amazing decision to buy this game.. I've found myself playing this game a ton in the past few months. It's really enjoyable and doesn't really get too boring. The ""Be A Pro"" mode isn't very realistic. It starts you off at the beginning of games as well as at the end of intermissions as the first line out there. Which doesn't really make sense, neither does the expectations to stay on a NHL team at the beginning. But Be a pro is still really fun and enjoyable. Playing it with friends is always a fun time and overall the game is really good.. I've never played NHL 09, but when I got my hands on this game I fell in love with it. It's one of the best sports games I've ever played, and way better then NHL 2K10.. Outside of the default settings resulting in a game with too much offense, it's the best hockey game ever made - bar none. Great feel to the game - skating, passing, shooting... even the checking feels pretty solid.. For some reason i had much more fun playing 09 but still this game was a good one. Goalie mode was by far the upside of this game and because nhl games seem to get better every year i give this a 7.8","coming from a person whose first NHL Game was NHL 08, i was blown away . i've found myself playing this game a ton in the past few months . the ""be a pro"" mode isn't very realistic ."
539.BioShock 2,"Not as good as bioshock 1 as of story but the gameplay is improved a lot………,,,,,.,,. It falls just short of the original in terms of its scope and storytelling, but makes up for it with balls-out action. Ramps up the intensity with the combat to a really fun level.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Bioshock 2 is largely a fan service to admirers of the original instalment, it expands on the epic atmosphere and combat of Bioshock 1. I absolutely love this game, it is just as good as the first if not better, 2k gave us the rapture experience through the eyes of a big daddy and delivered on every front. It will hold a special place in my heart forever.. Compared to 1, it is said that the operation is better, but it lacks the feeling of bringing more fun.... It's a beautiful game. Very atmospheric, those remnants of the city of Rapture, the former greatness of titan. Which is now dead, with **** crawling over its corpse and flies all around. And in all this ****, we find ourselves by the game.. dual weliding plasmids and weapons pretty good, these things part of the story of sofia lamb not so much too bad the ""common good"" binary choice did not see her in an insane asylum bare minimum. With the second game in the franchise, you don't get much new content. But it is nice to have even more of the great Bioshock gameplay, story and atmosphere. Overall rating: 9.0.. This was really amazing, I do like how it isn't directly connected to the first game, so if you find a copy the second one but can't find a copy of the first one, it doesn't matter too much. One of the things I like is being able to dual weild my gun and plasmid, which was one of the few problems I had with the first one. An all around master piece like the first.. I like this game even better than the original. The gameplay is superior and the story is just as good. Sure, the story is less clever than the original with no big twist but it's more emotionally resonant.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A good game but that’s all. It chooses to focus much of its gameplay on the worst part of BioShock 1. Furthermore, the story is just so much worse and has a lot of plot holes which are“explained” by saying “because Adam” which is just Lazy. Furthermore Lamb is a super uninteresting villain who is just comically evil. Overall a good game but nowhere near the quality of the first. Bioshock 2 improves on some aspects of the original. Systems such as the photo taking and other game mechanics are smoother and more fun. The story did not hit me as hard, but the overall experience was definitely well above average.. A better game than the first in almost every way. But compared to other games that came out around it's time, it's still pretty generic. Also Minerva's Den is overrated.. Return to the beautifully designed undersea realm of Rapture, this time filling the diving boots of a ""Big Daddy"". Another intriguing story although the differences to the first game are more embellishments than real changes so it all seems very familiar. If you liked the original Bioshock, you're sure to like this too.. Combat and levels are very good, but the story wasn't all that special at all. Some good additions and fun new things to play around with but it just isn't as good as the other 2 games.. Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock Bioshock. I did not play the DLC but I did play the base game. It was not as long as the first game but it did improve on mechanisms from the first game which made playing more fun and easy. Yet it was still missing some charm.. Bioshock 2 is an improvement to the original in almost every way. The gameplay is the biggest improvement the addition duel of wilding plasmids with weapons is a fantastic addition which lends itself to a better flow in combat. New and improved plasmids along with better weapons then the original also go a long way to making combat more engaging which was a problem in the original for me. The story is something a lot of people have a problem with and true while is doesn't have a big twist like the original what we do have is still an interesting plot that explores many of the themes from the first game in addition to some new interesting elements brought in this title. And while you cant play it today this game did have a multiplayer mode that I remember being fun but then again that was a long time ago so it's hard for me to say if it was good or not. The main issue with this as well as the first title is that I would say they struggle to find the right balance of difficulty as it feels no matter the difficulty I choose the game is either a cake walk or it's a near death experience when I enter a room. Not that it's an issue to much seeing as when you die you simply respawn in a vita chamber and only need to walk back to where you were with out loosing much actual progress. Despite that and some minor technical issues the game has at times I'd still say that the Bioshock 2 is a better game then the first if only by a bit. And while I don't want to talk about this too much the DLC expansion Minerva's Den was also really good and if you do enjoy this game at all it's definitely worth your time. And it comes along in the Bioshock collection for newer consoles.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing story and characters. The decaying atmosphere is very well done. Gameplay is better than the first.. Bioshock 2 was my first introduction to the trilogy, and it was an enjoyable experience from start to end in both gameplay and storytelling.. Gameplay 7/10: As the first part, BS2 contains tons of play options by a vast choice of weaponry. However, at some points the selection is too extensive and at times it becomes annoying to change the weapon too frequently due to low ammo. Style 9/10: Here dies BS2 the most. Coming back to Rapture felt great and the Soundtrack is just fitting. Story 6/10: My main problem with BS2 is that it does not feel very new after the first part. While the main story is quite boring, the background story of rapture was already told and does not offer mich more. Conclusion: Recommended to all huge fans of the first part, who want more. However, the DLC Minerva's Den would have been enough for me to play from the Big Daddy perspective.. if this game was not a sequel to BioShock then everybody would call it a masterpiece. The story is good but not as good, the gameplay is actually better then the first, music was amazing as always overall a very enjoyable experience.. Overall, BioShock 2 doesn't live up to the expectations of the masterpiece that was the original BioShock. The premise of the story was well executed, but loses its charm partway through. As a sequel, it plays it a bit too safe, encorporating familiar concepts and mechanics that were present in the original game. Though it improves in some of these aspects (such as the gameplay, graphics), there is a lack in innovation to try new things. Despite these flaws, I had a very enjoyable experience with the game and was not disappointed.. Also a good game as the first Bioshock but not as interesting as its predecessor. The biggest thing, in Bioshock, for me, was the game premesis. Not fan of big Dady :(. You may have fallen slightly from the first, but BioShock 2 has plenty of emotion to captivate even the most critical. .. I have never played this game. .. Certainly the lesser of the three Bioshock titles, but this second release still delivers strong. It is impossible to not enjoy delving deeper into new areas of Rapture.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I think it's just as good as the first, except feels a bit too familiar. Everything has been improved but story, and a multiplayer has been added. If you liked the first, you'll like this one, if you didn't, you won't. Bioshock 2 gets an 8.7/10. Don't get me wrong this was an excellent game, thrilling story, polished game-play, enthralling scenery and that same creepy shining-esque vibe of the original Bioshock. I gave the first game a 10, This game i have given an 8 largely based on 2 things. First the atmosphere of this game whilst staying true to the image of rapture never truly creeped me out or scared me, I felt that the colour scheme and graphics were more stylized and though beautiful were lacking that same dark edge of the original. Second was the gameplay, it was slightly more polished but similar enough that it only served to point out the shortfall between this games end result and that of the first. In saying all this it was never going to be a good thing being destined to be compared to a game like Bioshock and this game is definitely still worth your time.. I believe this game is well developed and I do agree that there are not as many twists and turns as the first but its story line is vary elaborate and entertaining.. Perfection yet again! They took an already amazing game and turned it into an amazing sequel with new characters, new enemies, and a whole new situation. You now get to see what it is like to be a big daddy and see what Rapture has now become. Not to mention and the new improvements they added to hacking! I could not have asked for a better sequel! It even adds a new version of the Big Daddy known as the Big Sister and be ready because she will give you a run for your money!. Rapture isn't quite as mysterious or intimidating the second time around, but the combat is hugely improved in Bioshock 2. If you enjoyed the first game for more than its story, you'll have fun with 2.. Back in 2010 this game was received positively by critics and gamers alike. 3 years later this game still plays great, with amazing scenery graphics this game simply rocks. However being a sequel to the extremely successful Bioshock 1 comparison is unavoidable... And this is were bioshock 2 falls a bit short.. Simply put its predecessor is much better.. However Bioshock 2 is still an amazing game and it has to be enjoyed by every gamer.... with the exception of the final run of the game it never gets out of its predecessors shadow, but on its own terms its still a great time that deserves a playthrough. Gameplay is improved in every way, even if the story is not as strong.. Bioshock 2 is the sequel to one of my favorite games, so it has a high expectation in my opinion. The story this time around has you playing as a big daddy and protecting little sisters. The plot does not feel as fresh as the first because we already had visited Rapture before. Nothing story wise lives up to its predecessor, not even the villain who falls in comparison to Andrew Ryan. The gameplay on the over hand is better than ever. You now get to use a weapon and a plasmid at the same time. The combat feels good and you really feel like you are a big daddy because how powerful you are in the game. There are a couple of new additions like a defense segment where you have to protect your little sister as she gathers atom for you. The multiplayer is very unnecessary and feels tacked on to an already complete package. The premise and set up is interesting but when you get down to the game itself it feels very bland. Bioshock 2 is still a good game, it might not live up to greats like the first Bioshock, but still worth a play for fans of the series.. Firstly; If you're expecting the beastiality of Biosock the First, then dont get your hopes up. However, this game is still a really good ride. The gameplay and graphics are better than Bioshock one. Overall a more fun game. But- and there's always a but- The storyline is not as good (so you get shot in the head, live, but the only way you can live forever is through Eleanor, I won't spoil it though), and there is way too much ammo lying around, and why no tommy gun Anyway, the guns are a bit OP, especally the drill, and there is not much interaction between Big Daddys (imagine how cool that would be). On a more positive note, the Big sister battles are really fun. Overall, pick this game up for a very enjoyable ride through the Rapturian Eutopia.. Bioshock 2's biggest flaw isn't one of technical or story parts, but rather the feeling. If you played the first Bioshock, everything feels all too familiar. It is no longer as mysterious and as a result, the game loses some of its luster. However, I will say the game is a step up from the first in its design and gameplay. While not vastly improved, minor annoyances such as the hacking minigame has been simplified. I just wish I felt like a Big Daddy throughout the whole game. The story on the other hand, while not as shocking or engrossing, is more clearly told and is much tighter emotionally since there is a set goal from the beginning. The multiplayer of Bioshock 2 is good, but nothing we haven't seen before. In the end, Bioshock 2 does not surpass the original, but boy it sure is fun to play.. Its story may not be as complex as the game preceding it, but ""Bioshock 2"" sure does elevate nearly every gameplay element, making it a brilliantly worthy sequel.. Take everything great about Bioshock and strip away the good story and you'll have Bioshock 2. Sure, it's entertaining, but the magic of a memorable story or new environment isn't there. And I don't know about you, but I expect big daddies to be agile, menacing characters. Yet when you take control of one, you're a slow, lumbering beast. Overall, the worst entry in the series by far, but still a notch ahead of most games you'll find out there.. Not better than Bioshock 1, but it definitely a true sequel to it! The MP is the only thing that brings this game down, but its you'll forget its there very easily! The atmosphere of this one is just as creepy with the new water riddled ruins of Rapture! A great sequel overall!. Fun and entertaining, It will continue to go all out on trying to kill you with wall crawling enemies or giant brutes that will overwhelm you. The Story is amazing if you haven't played the first one. But for a person going blind for the first time, The old fashion futuristic city is almost a dream to play in and kill some rotting ass. Plasmids are fun to play with once you mastered them but at the beginning I felt like I had to save it for major battles instead of using it on little guys which really held me back and got me hit. You have some weapons that you could upgrade to make them stronger but at times I just felt like I wanted more weapons enough though they were at poverty, there could of been a lot more than the generic weapons that was given to you. Bioshock 2 is amazing until the end but trying to play it again was very boring for me because I knew what was going to happen and I couldn't really play in any other direction.. Irrational Games, or 2K Boston, stepped out of the Bioshock series and left it to 2K Marin to develop the sequel to the marvel that is Bioshock. Bioshock 2 sold more copies than its predecessor during the opening month, but did not get the same rave reviews. It did is still a critically acclaimed game, just not the same as Bioshock 1. I believe it was overrated. Single-Player The gameplay is about the same. You have a similar amount of plasmids with a few old ones being replaced with new ones, and it is the same deal with the weapons. How you upgrade the weapons is exactly the same. There are still environmental hazards that can be utilized, however it doesn't seems as important to the mission. I found myself not using them nearly as much as I used them in Bioshock 1. The things that are new in the gameplay is the certain missions that are given like protecting a little sister from time to time. The presentation in the first game is not the same. This could be either a good or a bad thing. In my humble opinion, it is a bad thing. The entire feel of the world completely changed for me during my play through because of one thing, which took me time to realize. In the first game, you are practically alone against impossible odds. This time, you are the impossible odd. You are what you feared most in Bioshock 1, which is a Big Daddy. For some this can be an awesome experience, but to me, it took away that feeling of helplessness and fear that I once had. People feared me, instead of me fearing them. The game did have that same underwater, eerie city with psychos around every corner, I just feel that I wasn't really caring because I was the badass with a drill for a hand. Multiplayer I was actually surprised by the multiplayer. The use of plasmids and upgrading certain weapons using attachments was welcomed. There are also different weapons to be used in the multiplayer apart from the campaign. The maps may be limited and the customization may be slim, but the choices you had to eliminate the opposing team or protect a little sister was massive with all the combinations. At any given time a Big Daddy suit will pop up and allow a player to jump in it and have the abilities of an average Big Daddy. This added a sense of competition to it, as the first one who gets in it is able to dominate, however it isn't overpowered at all. There are multiple game modes to go along with the multiplayer that are welcomed and varied from each other, however it is the typical capture the flag and team death match deal. Overall the multiplayer is good, but it doesn't seem very bioshock-e. It is more like Call of Duty with plasmids, and you have to pick up a randomly dropped care-package in order to get a score streak. Overall the multiplayer is good, and is new to the series, just not new to the gaming industry, and what it has done has been done better. Put both the multiplayer and the single player together and you do indeed get a decent game, but the same thrill as in the previous game wasn't there, and it seemed to be more of a shooter than a survival horror shooter.. Flawed. Not as good as the first one, not my favorite, but this is a good game. I will start out with the good. This gameplay has been improved. Now that you have the ability to dual wield your plasmids and weapons, its great, really. The sound is still here. This game sounds great, and nothing was lost. The game is still really creepy, which is awesome. And it is cool how you participate in the Little Sister-Big Daddy relationship. The music is still fine, but not as breathtaking as the first. And thats the good. But the graphics have... lost some touch. No more art-deco means no more beauty. Sigh. And some of the level design was just to generic. It was based off of the items you achieved through the game. This game is less scarier, mainly because we have been here before. But I hate to say it, but some characters are not developed like in Bioshock 1. Eleanor, a main character in the story did not feel that emotional, even when she was supposed to be emotional. In fact, this games only competition is really against itself, Bioshock 1. But it still is fun to play. Bioshock fans will enjoy it, but it is linear. And as for the multiplayer, I did not like it. I will continue to avoid it because it was not ""well developed"" at all. I did not enjoy that aspect. But in the end, this is worth a buy, but only if you enjoyed the first.. A decent sequel, but lacks BioShock 1's attention to level detail, especially later on when the levels become more sloppy. The game feels a bit like you have been there and done it before, but even so, 2K Marin improved on the formula in many ways and even managed to tell a very meaningful and emotionally moving story too. My biggest regret is that they put you in a big daddy suit right at the beginning of the game. This took away a lot of the fear of vulnerability and kind made me feel overpowered like a superhero. Still the game has its moments like exploring outside Rapture, but I think making the player a big daddy was the wrong call. The biggest detractor for this sequel though goes to the inclusion of a pointless and expensive multiplayer mode. I really wish such an unwanted component didn't bring the score down, but it does. So there you have it. A great sequel marred only by its forced in multiplayer addition.. While I know many will disagree with me on this, I preferred Bioshock 2 over the original. Granted it more or less is almost the same game, but just better with improved gameplay mechanics, more or less fixing and improving on things that people complained about in the first game. It is a true sequel and as such it works well. In fact this is the first game who I actually like the multiplayer. It's nowhere near as complex and developed as other online multiplayer shooters, but for me that's what I like: It was simple and straightforward. Overall: I thoroughly enjoyed Bioshock 2 and look forward to Infinite.. Bioshock 2 was definitely one of my favourite games; to begin it has one of the best story lines I have come across in a game, to fully understand it you would have needed to play the first Bioshock, but in short… A city was built incredibly deep underwater as a form of paradise away from the rest of the world, but the city had its floor including the stem cell discovery called ADAM discovered from a parasite in the ocean that caused addiction and terrible side effects as well as a civil war breaking out in rapture to earn freedom, while you play as a “Big Daddy” which is an experiment of a man connected to a girl whom collects the contents of ADAM from corpses. All of the Bioshocks have this amazing/beautiful world the developers have created, but it is once you have entered it that you see the real sinister side behind it that was hidden from you, but what I loved about the introduction to Bioshock 2 is how it shows the point of view from the “bad guys” of the game, you see how they see and how they are trapped in this glorious world of their own in shining gold and its glory when actually they are in a war-torn wreck of a world with corridors of leaking cracked glass flooded with the growth of fungi and the dead. The game gives a large amount of back-story to the original and teaches you the details and viewpoints of several characters while introducing new ones, while playing the game at times you get the sheer amazing feeling of being a walking tank as you plough a drill fist through the face of a splicer or light them on fire with a modified rivet gun. The original Bioshock was slightly more of a horror game using several scenes that will make you jump and just a scary atmosphere in general, the second Bioshock how ever didn’t have as many scary scenes but still had its moments, I still remember playing the game in my younger teens when the game came out, several moments in the game had scared the living crap out of me including suspense built by the “big sisters” in the game. All in all Bioshock 2 was a very amazing beautiful game and has earned a high place in my list of top games just for the sheet sights, beauty and amazing feeling of being one hell of a bad-ass.. This was a very well done game an excellent succesor of the original. It is a shooter with some RPG elements which takes us back to Rapture an underwater city which captured my imagination the first time I visited. The action is very narrative driven which I love in a game and while I did not find the story quite as captivating as the original it is still very well done. I think they actually improved several aspects of the game such as the hacking mechanic which I did not enjoy in the last game. The action in this game hinges around preparing for battles with the big sister characters. Unlike Big Daddy's they are very fast and hard to pin down. The multiplayer doesn't really do much for me but that takes nothing away from a very solid single player experiance. Pick up this game if you haven't. Well, I have to say I was excited to see a Bioshock sequel coming around the corner, considering how much I loved the story, environment and combat of Bioshock. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. I was glad that they decided to allow you to use Plasmids AND Guns at the same time, rather than having to switch between each one manually. Also, they did do a great job of making you feel as if you are a Big Daddy, with the big submarine helmet, your bigfoot movement and the damage you took. I'm glad they added melee attacks to guns as well (since you might not want to have to switch to your drill). Hacking is now done in real-time, which seems like an improvement, but now the hacking system is even easier than the previous hacking system. And the guns, well, aren't much to brag about. They are practically the same as the previous game, just with a different name, ammo type and outlook. The only 'new' item is the hack tool, which is particularly good considering that now you can hack remotely from a distance. The ""Protect the Sister"" parts on the singleplayer are a nice touch, and I'm glad that 2K took attention to realize that you are a Big Daddy that needs to protect their little sisters as they are recovering adam for you. And you will need it. the secret improve-your-gun stations are more rare and now you will have to strategically choose which upgrades you want on your gun, because you won't get them all. However, I was disappointed they completely cut the ammo creation station, which made the game feel much shorter from the previous game. Also, I don't like how you have to use your Health Kits using one button on the D-pad, yet you can only take your plasmids when you are COMPLETELY out of EVE at the time. Iron Sights have been added for all guns now, and you can put on true ironsights if you want (even for the hack tool). But, the story was the real kick in the shins for me. Now, it was interesting, initially, with the whole Big Sister concept and how you were slowly dying and losing your mind from being torn apart from your little sister, but the tyrant, Sofia Lamb, was a lot less interesting than Andrew Ryan and more annoying so. Sofia just seems to keep talking to you as if she's trying to analyze something, and compared to her methods from Andrew Ryan, she's taken a more collective and socialistic method rather than him. The graphics seem downgraded somehow from the previous game, with graphics constantly being blurred out that haven't loaded right, as well as very smooth and choppy NPC's. Also, the ending was most possibly the most anti-climactic boss fight I have seen yet. In the fight to retain your little sister back and to get revenge on sofia lamb, you COMPLETE THE GAME BY DESTROYING TWO PIPES! TWO PIPES?! WOW! that must have been hard, considering that vigilante Big Daddy's and Brute Splicers will keep spawning on you if you don't destroy them. But, the most annoying thing that I think 2K thought they had to do to make the game popular was the multiplayer. I have heard so many bad things about it, and playing it, all of them were true. Most graphic pop-ups won't load, player movement is always choppy, and gameplay can become seriously unbalanced considerably. But, other than Black Ops, it was actually funny for me to see all of this happen as I was playing, and I just played to see how bad or good it really was. Bioshock doesn't need multiplayer, the first one was fine on it's own on the singleplayer because it was engaging and awesome at the same time. I guess when 2K decided to make Bioshock 2's singleplayer kind of recycled from the first game, they decided to make multiplayer to compensate for it. It didn't work. Hopefully, Bioshock: Infinite should be worthwhile considering that is free from the original bioshock universe. Still, this game should be worth your time, considering many of it's improvements, but it is seriously lacking in a decent multiplayer experience and far more an engaging and unfamiliar story arc.. The first BioShock was amazing but the game broke on me :(. So I decided to play the second game. Improvements from the old game, decent story, improved gameplay but its too much the same as the first one. BioShock 2 8.1/10. Great game.. BioShock is among the greatest games of my generation, and ranks in my top 10 all time games (classics not included). BioShock 2, for the most part, does not live up to the standard of the first. But that's not saying much. It is akin to trying to sequel a masterpiece of art, or a symphony. Sure, the artist will give you a good product, but overcoming the barrier they set for themselves seems to be too much to handle most of the time. This game falls squarely into that category. It is a very good game, and one I enjoyed very much. But really, how do you follow up a artistic masterpiece?. I didn't think anything could beat Bioshock as my favourite game ever. that was until no2 came along. I need a 11 rating for this as i put 10 for Bioshock 1. The story is better, the plasmids are improved, the weapons are a step up and the fact that i can simultaneously use my weapons and plasmids really opened up the game! Love it, my new fav game of all time!. Bioshock 1 instantly impressed with its unique design and kept the player hooked with its uncommon gameplay and story through the game. Now with bioshock 2 it is somehow like hearing the same joke twice in a row. It fails to deliver enough new elements to be interesting. While i would really love to tell positive things about this game since i generally really like the combination of 3d shooter with slight rpg elements i just honestly can not do so. I did not even manage to finish the game, just got bored after a while and stopped playing it. Sure will give it a second chance some time and maybe even enjoy finishing it than, but at its release it just disappointed me. 6/10. A disappointing sequel that captures none of the magic that made the first game great, the campaign is weak, the story and characters are uninteresting unlike the first where the story instantly **** me in and I had to find out all about the characters, even the audio logs which were fantastic in the first, are stupid and honestly just boring to listen to, and the while thing just suffers of a feeling of been there done that, it's only in its last few levels that it's fun to play, and packs one moment I wont forget, you think that going back to Rapture would be a chance to find out some new secrets about it, but it only allows you to find out one, and finding out that secret is the best part of the game just because it's more info on the little sisters, they did add some new features like the ability to use Plasmids and guns at the same time, and added new weapons but honestly I didn't really like them I would have much rather just of had the original guns, and only the shotgun actually seems powerful, and you also are a Big Daddy this time, but for some reason you feel like a weakling, I felt more powerful in the original, and ammo just seems to disappear to quickly, so the campaign is a HUGE and frustrating let down up until the last few levels, the best part and the reason you should buy this is for the multiplayer which is fantastic and will keep me coming back, and still has a large community still playing it, so if your not connected to Xbox Live you can pass on this unless you have to have more Rapture, in the end it's a sad sequel to a fantastic game, and it's campaign only manages to be fun in it's last moments, but manages to pack some fantastic multiplayer, but learning more about the Little Sister is worth it, so do I recommend this? yes, but only to the most hardcore of Bioshock fans that can forgive the numerous flaws and the disappointments.. a disappointment to say the least. this game did not live up to the hype for me at all. The entire premise of the game is being able to play as a big daddy, but you never actually FEEL like the terrifying monstrosities from the first Bioshock. I can understand why you're not supposed to be invincible, it doesn't make for a fun game if no one can kill you, but there just wasn't enough in this game to set aside the growing fact that t","bioshock 2 is largely a fan service to admirers of the original instalment . it expands on the epic atmosphere and combat of Bioshock 1 . compared to 1, it is said that the operation is better ."
54.Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree,"Shadow of the Erdtree is one of the best and most extensive DLCs I've ever played. It skilfully uses all of Eldenring's strengths and simply transfers them to a new setting. The bosses and the open world are designed to be just as fascinating and adventurous.. The best and most extensive DLC I've ever played in a game. It does everything exactly right that a DLC needs to do. Same strong game but a big interesting story&world expansion. Miyazaki gets it right again, for the second time in a row, in one of the best games ever made.This DLC is a work of art, a beautiful painting with every imaginable color. Only a true genius could create something like this, Miyazaki (and his entire team) are to be congratulated for this achievement, Shadow of the Erdtree is a game in itself, if they wanted, they could sell it as a separate game.Every time I thought I had explored the entire map, more and more things appeared, this is an unbelievable level design. All directions were used, the map stretches from the extreme north to the extreme south, from top to bottom, there is always more and more to be discovered, and God knows I explored this game too much and there is still more to be found. There are so many bosses, so many enemies, and always in wonderful scenarios that simply enchant you; at no point does the player feel ****'s scary to think about the size of this DLC, but most of all it's scary to think that human beings made this, and not literal Gods, this is, by far the best DLC ever made for a game, and maybe forever will be.. Utterly satisfying. Shadow of the Erdtree is a natural and satisfying complement to the original masterpiece. It's also worth mentioning that this is the first (story) DLC I've ever played and was very excited to do so. And of course all of this excitement is grounded in the acceptance of Elden Ring being a masterpiece, despite all the objective and subjective shortcomings. So, if you loved the main game, then Shadow of the Erdtree is a must. Firstly - it's massive, it took me 50+ hours to finish compared to the 200+ of the original game and that's more than enough. I disagree with the complaints about the game's 40$ price tag, since it's still a very dense experience that outshines the value of many full-priced AAA titles actually. Of course, it's smaller than the original, but the original was huge, to the point that after some 160 hours of play I was torn between the itch of exploring every spot I missed and wanting it to be over. While having a smaller map size, the map is much, much more densely packed. The size of the map is similar to Limgrave, but, for one, there is much more verticality, also the points of interest are closer to each other. The only complaint here is that the main game's map layout feels more natural, though this is the Shadow Realm, so maybe that's also on purpose. All in all this helps SotE to conclude on the high note of feeling satisfactory and not overwhelming. The DLC is nicely woven into the main game, both from gameplay and story perspective, as if the story was initially planned with the DLC in mind. Shadow Realms is visually very impressive, and FromSoftware manages once again to deliver the same wow effect when transitioning from the cave to getting the first glimpse of Shadowlands. From the first glance, it's clear that Shadow Realm has its own visual identity. Not only through its locations but also primarily through its visual style. You could easily guess from a screenshot whether it's Shadow Realm or Lands Between. That said, I should admit that it's not as visually striking as some of the main game locations, but that's partly because the main game had the advantage of this first wow effect. Some aspects I didn't care about were the new combat styles and weapons. I ended up playing the whole game with my main-game character and build, only occasionally switching to the new stronger talismans and armors from DLC. Speculating about a possible Elden Ring 2, SotE maybe wouldn't cut it, but it's more than one can expect for a DLC.. Masterpiece. Best DLC of all time, only DLC to be nominated for GOTY, rated 10/10 almost everywhere. I don’t need to say more BUY ELDEN RING+SOTE!!!. Some of the best crafted world design I have ever seen. Shadow of the Erdtree already builds off the masterpiece of the base game. This DLC takes it to the next level in terms of world design, boss battles, and much more. The DLC is massive and rich with content. Some of the most difficult bosses lie ahead so be warned.. It is the absolute insanity of letting an artist become a game director, and making every corner of the game an art house Nightmare. Including the boss fights, and I experience an unmatched typed of intensity and sensation from the whole thing, and it was my pick for game of the year. I knew it wasn't gonna win, I think they just wanted to make sure that DLC like it were made more frequently on the same level of effort and quality, by just acknowledgment. and the whole thing was truly Beautiful for everything that may potentially come next..... but if it doesn't this is the DLC, that can help me say with honesty, Elden Ring can last forever.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. There is really nothing to criticize about the gameplay. If you like the main game, you should also play the DLC. However, some of the bigger bosses sadly have no cutscenes. I don't know why they cut back on the presentation. Also, some areas are very nicely designed but barely filled with content. Just an amazing game it makes you feel that you are playing a new entiere game. More of a boss rush than actual exploration The map, while empty and full of reused enemies, is still really cool and the new content is nice. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands on the base game with a massive new map, featuring intricate designs and stunning visual storytelling. The DLC introduces fresh environments, including eerie fields and towering castles, while maintaining the series’ signature challenge. New enemies, like horned knights and grotesque creatures, enhance the difficulty, and the bosses—such as the Divine Beast Dancing Lion—are as brutal as ever. The dense exploration and interconnected zones reward curious players with countless secrets. This expansion refines the open-world formula and offers even more reasons to immerse yourself in Elden Ring's universe. fromsoftware always manages to make improvement to something already considered to be a masterpiece. I know everyone will say it's good, just cos it's from software. However it's ok. However, enemies just felt more like eye candy, instead of stuff that's fun to fight. Every boss needs all these flashing effects going on, then you take tons of damage at some random time. Your not learning the times from the animations, your learning them by counting how long from the moment the attack starts. Yes I completed the DLC before writing this. But this new direction FS are going in where they are constantly trying to 1 up themselves by making things more extreme, just isn't for me. Malenia **** in the base game. I didn't want to fight several more similar bosses. I love hard bosses. Why else would I play these games. But when you have no idea what's even going on cos of the exaggerated effects, just feels tedious to learn. I still prefer Dark Souls 1. Encounters were just overall more thought through, and boss attacks were easy to pick-up and understand. Not a bunch of disco light. Oh yh. If you enjoy your 60 fps in the base game. Your gonna love the constant stutters in the DLC. The moment you enter the DLC, despite the area having less stuff going on, your frame rate is all over the place. Still no performance fix patch as of 26th November 2024. I normally don't care about Unreal Engine. However I think they need to finally switch. Lies of P is a clear example that these games just work better on UE. From software games on PC, always feel terrible compared to consoles. Apperantly it doesn't pre compile shaders on PC?? The DLC does look nice. Area can be fun to explore. Some enemy types and weapons were fun. They just dropped the ball on the bosses. I hope we get more classic bosses in their future titles.. For those complaining on the nomination: This is NOT fault of the game, Fromsoft or even Miyazaki. It was nominated because of The Game Awards decided it should be this way. Oh, and of course, this DLC was nominated because no game compare to it this year, hehehe.. For all the people review bombing the DLC for it being nominated... stop, the DLC has no fault and shouldn't be getting all the hate, take all your hate and dump it somewhere else.. DLC did not live up to expectations a lot of lore was mishandled and didn’t have the impact it was building up to.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It’s amazing I don’t know what other people are saying beautiful addition to the game. Probably best dlc ever created,map is back to dark souls 1 lvl of **** design is phenomenal since, probably got my favourite boss soundtracks from dlc with Rellana and **** sure harder then base game like it was expected ,lots of broken weapons to use ..This dlc is how every developer should make dlc and not ask 40e for hours like diablo.. This DLC is everything I hate about fromsoftware. Bosses are very bad and the game is slow. Not worthy of game of the year level.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The fact that people are now review bombing this DLC, which is comparable and better than a whole other game, just tell how much other game fan base are falling, and feel both hostile and in danger to a DLC. The DLC does not match the quality of the base game at all, given the wonky level scaling and the most tedious and unfair boss design ever seen in a Souls game.. It is a giant map for a dlc, took me many hours to beat, with much frustration, but it‘s Elden Ring. So many new bosses and enemies its crazy what you get. It would be really cool if the dlc gets GOTY award, one game winning two times never happened before. And remakes and remasters can also get nominated, why shouldn‘t dlc‘s.. Well...what can you say when one of the most creative team takes 2 years to deliver a DLC big as the average open world production of the current days (minimum 50 hours of gameplay) improving the formula of the vanilla game of 2 years before and delivering a massive lore content that could be considered as Elden Ring Part 2? 9/10 only because there are some balance issues with some bosses or mob (did someone say damage output?) and because some elements of the lore and narration, expecially around the end, could've been more detailed and polished. But considering the huge amount of work and overall quality of the DLC it's not a cardinal sin. Everything that I dislike about souls games is in this dlc, tanky beyond reason enemies. Unfair attacks that cannot be dodged. They took what I loved about Elden Ring and through it all out sadly.. I love the new weapon types, the new ashes of war, the new bosses and all the new weapons that add more depth to your builds. Such a fun expansion, you can tell fromsoft put a lot of love and care into this!. What to say? The best videogame expansion ever until now. It can provide, for the first run, like 40-50 high quality hours. The world design is improved from the base game, and the Shadow Realm remembers Lordran for its complexity and the number of interconnections. The DLC pushes you to explore carefully, because some entire sections with important bosses are very well hidden behind dungeons or even fake walls. The boss fights are incredibly stunning and choreographic, even though some are a bit problematic, like “dirty” in moveset, with moves difficult to predict. The difficulty is pretty high, but if you know how to exploit what the game offers, it can become a lot easier (there are of course OP weapons, incantations and summons). The narration is clear and also more explicit than expected, the NPCs are quite numerous and their quests easy to understand (with some exceptions, sadly). If you liked Elden Ring, you can’t miss the DLC.. Kinda hard, but still fun gameplay, good graphics and solid gameplay. Story is decent, but it seems as if that wasn't really the focus of the devs.. best DLC oat and it isn't even close. i was playing this game when my gran fell down the stairs and died but i was too busy playing sote to care. 10/10. ""Shadow of the Erdtree"" further enriches the Elden Ring experience, adding high-quality content while preserving the unmistakable Souls-like formula. This DLC expands the already vast world with mysterious new areas and breathtaking settings, all steeped in a uniquely eerie atmosphere. The challenges have been carefully crafted to test even seasoned players of the base game, featuring enemies with improved AI and even more demanding, inventive boss **** lore deepens, introducing elements and narratives that seamlessly connect to the existing universe. Every corner hides secrets waiting to be uncovered, adding layers of intrigue and discovery. While minor technical issues persist, they don’t detract from the adventure or diminish the overall experience.""Shadow of the Erdtree"" is a DLC that makes Elden Ring even richer and more captivating—perfect for those eager to continue exploring this dark, rewarding world.. Great dlc. Cool new boss, items, spells, locations. I just wish there's a second and final dlc to come.. Great DLC. I'll say more - this dlc is a million times better than many AAA modern games, which can't help but be frustrating really.Added very nice new locations, mechanics, weapons, armor. In general, everything as always at the appropriate level, the developers are good!Yes, as it seemed to me, screwed up the complexity on some bosses. Yes, and in general there were mobs that with two blows took out me. But I overcame it all! The game is very satisfied. In addition, they revealed even more detailed plot, which can not but please. Definitely recommend it to everyone!. This dlc did everything better than the main game except for exploration and loot. The fights were insane and really enjoyable, the world that they have created is also amazing. But the only thing that I felt lacking in comparison to the main game was that the world felt more empty and that there was no real reward for exploring every corner. Normally in soulsgames you would always find something satisfying. Even though it was lacking in that part, the rest is just more than perfect for me (fights, weapons, lore). Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is a fantastic expansion that builds upon the incredible foundation of the base game. If you loved Elden Ring, you’ll find everything that made it great is present, along with new challenges that elevate the experience even **** expansion introduces fresh environments that are just as beautifully crafted and immersive as the original, filled with secrets and lore waiting to be uncovered. The difficulty has definitely been cranked up, providing a satisfying challenge for seasoned players looking to push their skills to the limit. It’s a perfect blend of intense combat and exploration that keeps you on your **** new content feels thoughtfully integrated, adding depth to the already rich narrative while expanding on beloved mechanics. Whether it’s new bosses that test your mettle or intriguing quests that flesh out the world, Shadow of the Erdtree is packed with high-quality additions that enhance the overall experience.Overall, this is one of the best expansions of the year, and a must-play for any Elden Ring fan. It takes everything you loved about the base game and amplifies it, making for an unforgettable adventure. Don’t miss this opportunity to dive back into the Lands Between!. Nothing new, not bad just kinda boring if I dare to say. Oversized map and too much repeated content. Bosses were good at least. Incredible densly packed extensive spectacle from start to finish. I have 2 criticisms: 1) In typical FROMSOFT fashion the dlc is acessed more or less at the end of the game which makes using the dlc weapons and spells awkward for the base game if you dont go for ng+ which many ppl dont like. 2) The final boss is crazy hard. I'd say i'm pretty cracked reaction wise and a souls veteran but this was the absolut limit of bs i can put up with.. Simply an amazing DLC that almost feels like a whole new game. They really went above and beyond with the art and map design. Not to mention the many additional weapons, armour, items and even new game mechanics.. Shadow of the Erdtree is a huge dlc. Full of secrets, locales and bosses. The npcs are really good. The vistas are a beauty as usual. Just wish the end and ending had some defining moment. The story end kind of a let down. The Old Hunters is still the best fromsoftware dlc.. Elden Ring was already one of the best games that I have ever played. The music, gameplay, build variety, bosses, level design and the open world are all beautifully crafted and work together so well. And then Fromsoft just does it again. This DLC has everything that made the base game better but more streamlined and thought-out. I really loved playing this and I'm very excited for what their next project will be.. CURSE YOU BAYYYYYYYLE!

BAYLE THE DREAD YOU SHALL HAUNT ME NO LONGER.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 10) Masterpiece - 9) Amazing - 8) Great - 7) Good - 6) Above Average - 5) Mediocre - 4) Below Average - 3) Bad - 2) Terrible - 1) Pile of **** - 0) Worst game ever contender. Of course, FromSoft managed to make the best DLC ever made. This truly is an expansion, on both the story but also the world and gameplay. 200% recommend playing this (after playing the main game of course).. Greatest game ever made hands down! The character creation, The world & the battles are amazing. Best DLC ever! More of the already awesome game and the most dificult boss fight ever to close the game. 10/10. I'm addicted to pain and suffering, this game is amazing for me 11/10, i cant wait to see what from software will create next!. Nothing new here. More difficult, which it should be, very confusing at times to traverse the open world. Speaking of the open world, not much going on here. There is no sense of wonder and I dont feel excited to explore like I did in the base game. Repetitive bosses and odd boss placement. Now for the positive...game plays very well, just like the base game.Cool new armor and weapons to try out. If you enjoyed the base game, give the DLC a try, but keep your expectations in check.. It’s Elden ring dlc from the scenery to the difficulty everything is perfect and rewarding. Best game of all time, received the best DLC of all time, that’s all I’m gonna say, it’s so good, it’s a masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Loved My time with the dlc a great follow up to base game minus the terrible boar boss fight and the Bs final fight. Better and more interersting areas to explore, not dull side dungeons, and actually great boss fights witch are challenging but fair and fun to defeat.. The most impressive DLC of all time. Filled with engaging content, new gameplay elements wich add extensive replayability, spectacular art direction and most of all, easily by far the best bosses From Software ever made. An absolute masterpiece and the first time I think a DLC can be worthy of GOTY.. A lot of people complaining the game is **** that's y I love game.. challenging.. this dlc is bigger than many games ... It was good but started to really feel the copy paste enemies and some of the bosses were a little jank. Ignore review deletion is not an option Ignore review deletion is not an option Ignore review deletion is not an option. What a game... this is an amazing journey, I never imagine that could be better than the original game, the game is just amazing. Once you finish I bet you will stop playing for some days/weeks, you will need it.. amazing bosses, amazing music, amazing world design, amazing new weapons, this could have been easily been named Elden Ring 2 and it would have been still perfect. I've played plenty of other Souls games, and this is the first time I've been genuinely disappointed. I was wary about getting it prior to release (mainly because of the price tag), but after seeing that people thought it was worth it, I finally bit the bullet. I wish I didn't. The whole map is too winding and confusing, with basically nothing in it. New weapons I found were worthless or unable to be used with my build (I guess we're all big fans of INT+FTH in this DLC, huh), bosses felt uninspired or just the same unbalanced junk that has plagued FS games forever (i.e. big enemy that hops around in large room), even mini dungeons with no bosses at the end. My build used a lot of Vigor and heavy armour, plus a shield; I still got melted in two hits by most things. After some hours it started to feel like a chore and I just wasn't having fun anymore. I like hard games, I like challenging myself. This doesn't feel like that. Couldn't even be bothered to finish it. I loved the base game and played it a few times. That won't be happening with this. Wish I'd spent the $50 on something else.. The way the world of Elden Ring is represented, with that mixture of Gothic and medieval, macabre art and repeated homages to the masters of horror and previous works, make From Software a studio with full self-awareness.. The best elden ring DLC in the world. Boss 9/10 Map design 10/10 Story 10/10. worst game ever repetitive and bosses are the same i delet it it is no fun to make souls games an open world. I rarely give something a 10/10 but this being a DLC went so far above and beyond it quite literally is almost its own game. It improved on the base game in every way imaginable. It wasn’t just a copy paste with a couple new ideas. This was full blown creativity and a work of art.. High level game as usual from From Software, my lifetime favorite game. But DLC seems a little empty compare to it's main game. But the map design is another level.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Is perfect, the game is perfect, its all a dark souls fan need in a videogame and more, congratulations Miyazaki. A great addition to the Elden Ring story. I wish there were more DLC coming.. You get what you expect. I don't understand all those negative voices about the dlc even though i'm really critical with the main game. For me the dlc was even better than the main game and i wish i could play it as a stand-alone title. An open world in perfect size. Different approaches to deal with enemys. Fantastic bosses. (sadly reused again) And finally interesting dungeons not that repetetive than in the main game. I enjoyed it a lot even though the final boss was a pain, in terms of too many optical distractions. An overusage of effects is simply a bad design choice and i hope fromSoftware will choose a different path in the future.. Exploration, dungeons are ok, in despite of this,bosses are unbalanced, trashs also, the game is too difficult to take pleasure, i finish the final boss with 5 hours of tries !!! not fun... without a really ending cinematic. Boring really; i prefer the original game even if it was too repetitive.. The story design is not good. Example I like to explore the map but I do not expect that some questline is disconnected! Bad experiencee. SOTE manages to surpass the main game, already exceptional, in terms of map design and boss design even giving the player new powerful tools to build their own character. As the main game, though, not every area feels completely developed and some main bosses don't deliver as they should, keeping the title away from perfection. Would deserve a 9 if you take the dlc nature of SOTE in account. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fantastic Expansion to Elden Ring! This DLC has so much to offer - massive world, more weapons, new weapon types, a variety of new enemies and Bosses. The new scaling system to level up was a creative addition. The bosses are as challenging as you would expect from FromSoftware but beatable. There are a number of memorable battles and legacy dungeons! I am looking forward to my next play though. Enjoy Tarnished!. I hate it from the bottom of my heart. If this is the future of video gaming ... I'm out !. Giant expansion, almost like a full new game. Even better bosses than in the base game and great world building. Amazing DLC it surpassed all off the other fromsoftware dlc in nearly every single way. Could’ve been a new game and people wouldn’t complain, amazing bosses especially Mesmer, bayle and relanna(even the final boss) if you hate it just get good. Can’t wait for the next Fromsoft piece of content. It's a DLC, but it should be game of the year! Every bit as good as the original game. New bosses. Fresh experiences!. Shadow of the Erdtree is an exceptional expansion that further enriches the Elden Ring universe, offering players new challenges, fascinating places to explore and a host of new weapons. The progression system keeps the difficulty high by making players relive the same sensations of the base game.. This is the best DLC ever released. Expanding on an already phenomenal experience. If you have the will power, this is a life enhancing experience.. Feels like a completely new game when I first accessed the DLC! Best expansion so far from the developers.. Its a good game but i didnt enjoy It, i think this game is overhyped. I bought It and after one month I went to sell It and buy an other Game. like everything from FromSoftware, a masterpiece. The new areas are fantastically designed and the boss fights are phenomenally good. The best DLC of the year. While Elden Ring feels like the most flawed FromSoft game out there I've played, Shadow of the Erdtree fixes all of my issues with the base game by making a world that remains interesting to explain constantly, all with some phenomenal bosses that remain fair and balanced (aside from the final one). The scadutree fragment system by far saved open world progression here in a game that had an issue of making exploration feel stale.. I’m a huge Fromsoftware fan who has a platinum trophy in all their games. All those games starting with Demon Souls are masterpieces to me. I preordered Shadow of the Erdtree and was counting minutes to start playing the most anticipated DLC EVER. At first, the game looked a top notch but over the course of time, I started noticing numerous flaws of the game. Good sides of the DLC: 1) Some visuals and bosses design are impressive. Disappointments: 1) No trophies 2) Unfair difficulty and constant one shots. The game tries everything possible to make me fight a boss as long as possible to prolong the DLC duration. The bosses are too aggressive, leaving me frustrated after beating them. 3) Poor exploration. The vanilla game caught my attention immediately. There was always something interesting to find, upgrades, weapons, golden seeds. There was a sense of wonder to puzzle out every secret the game has. The majority of DLC is absolutely empty. 4) Poor rewards. After riding empty fields for 30 minutes, the best reward the game can provide is another cookbook. 5) Extremely boring dungeons. Even though many criticized the main game dungeons, I found them pretty interesting to explore with many secrets and chilling bosses at the end. Here many dungeons not only don’t provide anything interesting, but some dungeons even don’t have a boss. 6) Overly interconnected world which feels unpleasant and tedious to explore. All in all, Fromsoftrare has delivered the worst DLC. The game feels completely unfair and not engaging at all. To play SotE is a monotonous job unlikely FS games. My PSN: fatalpurpleduck. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. And I thought the base game was perfect… This DLC takes the base game and make it 10x better. Especially the map environments is beyond amazing its way better than the base game. My only negative is that they introduced new weapons types but only added 1-3 in every new category, I hoped for at least 7 weapons in each new category but that won’t stop me from giving the DLC 10/10 ( THE DLC ISNT THAT HARD STOP CRYING). This DLC just pushed Elden Ring into an untouchable position so far beyond any other game I’ve experienced. I’m quite convinced I’ll never play a game that’s better than this in the rest of my life.. How can you describe it? They could have call it elden ring 2, because call it a DLC is underestimated. The excellence of excellence, fromsoft master himself showing one of the most incredible game I've ever played. And as a souls fan and player, I have witnessed the excellence of everything, level design is out of scale, art direction, reward exploration, verticality, a Surprise at corner. A continue be different, be better, a continue surprise even for a veteran player. They peaked everithing and made it better. Difficulty? Only if you are not a souls player, freedom of play, builds and how to overcome is in your hands, I'm having the best experience so far. Shadow of the erdtree deserve to be Goty. Best expansion **** just a masterpiece game..They are only improving on their ****'t wait for what fromsoft is planning next. Honestly a pretty typical dlc for a soulsborne game and i mean this in a good way, great new bosses, awesome new weapons and gear, and overall just a fun time though some of the bosses are a bit yikes, but none made me frustrated save perhaps the final one but still overall a ton of fun.. More of the same, again. Good content, just repetitive. The base game open world was too long, too vast, to get back to this DLC with more of the same.. A fantastic culmination of one of the best games in recent years! This expansion sets new standards and will serve as a benchmark for future titles in its genre. It’s an add-on that feels like a fully-fledged new game.. Shadow of the Erdtree became an exercise in frustration, not fun. The relentless difficulty spike and unforgiving combat mechanics clearly catered to the most hardcore players, leaving casual gamers like me in the dust. Additionally, the ridiculous move sets of some bosses felt artificially difficult and contrived, creating a sense of cheapness rather than genuine challenge. I longed for the sense of wonder and exploration I once felt, but it was replaced by a grind that felt more like a chore than an adventure, so I had to step away.. better than the original game, good bosses, good weapons, and when you explore you find good things, not as the freaking base game.... This DLC is just perfect, i dont know what else to say, the boss fights are amazing, the Art direction is majestic. This DLC is just perfection. Not a game for everyone. Like all souls-like games, you have to learn the enemy movements to properly fight them. Amazing graphics , soundtrack is memorable and the gameplay provides you the satisfaction of winning against unfavorable odds.. This is, simply put, one of the best dlc's i have ever played. The exploration of the shadow realm is great, the new bosses are great and the story is quite interesting. People complain that this dlc is too hard, but I think if you could beat elden rings main game, you should enjoy this dlc very much.. From Software continue to show other studios how to produce quality. Even though this is a dlc, it has more and better content than many full games. I have taken 4 separate characters through it and enjoyed every journey. Anyone downrating th",Shadow of the Erdtree is one of the best and most extensive DLCs I've ever played . it skilfully uses all of Eldenring's strengths and simply transfers them to a new setting . the bosses and open world are designed to be just as fascinating and adventurous .
540.Kerbal Space Program,"This game even after being released over 9 years ago, still holds its place as a very engaging space exploration simulator with its very realistic physics and overwhelming modding community which makes the game very enjoyable to this day. In conclusion, Jeb is dead and I killed him.. Just The best game ever made, ill repeat20 times: Just The best game ever made,Just The best game ever made,Just The best game ever Just The best game ever made,made, Just The best game ever made,made,Just The best game ever made,Just The best game ever made,Just The best game ever Just The best game ever made,made, Just The best game ever made,made,Just The best game ever made,Just The best game ever made,Just The best game ever Just The best game ever made,made, Just The best game ever made,made,Just The best game ever made,Just The best game ever made,Just The best game ever Just The best game ever made,made, Just The best game ever made,made,Just The best game ever made,Just The best game ever made,Just The best game ever Just The best game ever made,made, Just The best game ever made,made, ok i hope i repeated 20 times.. I got the game for my birthday and I was like ""Oh!, my friends say I'm a genius or something, this is going to be another simulator!"" After that I got really attached to the game. I actually got this custom built controller for ksp that cost me 1370 USD :) which was really worth it. Overall, the game is really fun as long as you have the brain power.. Time in-game: 10.7h I only played this game for a short time right now, but i absolutely adore it, it is challenging yet fun at the same time. There is a lack of explorable stuff on planets and nothing outside the current system.. This game is EPIC! It is unbeatable! I think there is no game in the world, that can beat Kerbal Space Program.. Put a silly little guy into a silly little rocket and act surprised when he goes missing. Rinse and repeat. Endless fun.. Overall, very good. I like space games, and this is one of my favs of all time. The creativity in making your own rockets and seeing just how far you can send your Kerbals makes it a masterpiece. My favorite mode in this game is sandbox as it has everything unlocked and you can make a rocket big or small. realistic or chaotic. and make your own space program without the drawbacks of Career mode. you can even make a plane to fly around Kerbin or make a spaceplane and send it to, well, space! speaking of which, Career mode is ok. not really that realistic but a game doesn't have to be realistic to be good. the tourist contracts get annoying very quickly. Science mode is better cause it doesn't have the annoyance of contracts and the starter buildings. The KSP community is fantastic and very helpful. even the mods for the game are outstanding! but just the base game is good enough for me. the stock graphics are very good even on the lowest settings. i would give it a 10 if it didn't have the kraken that destroys any ship, station, or structure above 200 parts. btw, i recommend using struts or the in game autostrut system for big ships. and if your ship doesn't make it to where you want to go, MOAR BOOSTERS is the motto of this community. if you like space games, i'd recommend this game 100% of the time. i'd even recommend it more than KSP2. but if you want a space game with somewhat realistic orbital mechanics, a way to make your own rockets, and cool destinations to visit, this is the game for you.. i liked this game. Game has great idea. This game is hard and has confusing mehanics.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. this game is good but it has alot of bugs and is not very polished so i cant give it more than a 4. I love space and planes, this game has both. It's easy to get in to, but hard to master. You can build basically whatever you want with the tools the basegame offers. But I must say, the game does become boring after a few hundred hours. The graphics are not good and without a proper pc it runs like s**t. But that's where the mods come in. The game has a huge modding community that is active and makes quality mods. If you want it in the game they have it. Combining the graphics mods with gameplay mods makes the game fun again, I would say I know since I have above 500 hours in the game, and none of it would have been possible without the mods.. It's a really good game for who wants to be an astronaut since I was a kid. But terrible controls (in editor). I'm waiting for KSP 2.. Was stolen by Epic Games before I start this game. 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 rate.. It's a very good game, it even taught me enough to be able to make my own space program in real life, but, it's a quite basic game without mods. If you want to play this game, make sure to install mods using CKAN (Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network). To make it short and simple, if i could only play one game for the rest of my life it would be this one (with a few mods).. I've often heard of this game & thought it might feel too much like school physics work while playing it. I finally got it recently & Im disappointed with myself for not getting it sooner. It's great fun & has far more to it than I thought. I'd recommend following a few YouTubers like Scott Manleys career mode guides to get started & it will be very enjoyable.. Kerbal Space Programm is a creative, well-made and succsess-deserving quality game with a lot of good points: The planets in the custom system are not too difficult to get to and creative and well-made. The rocket-building UI is easy to use, but also provides advanced tools for experienced players. The parts are diverse and creative. And the physics are very realistic. The only flaw I have seen so far is: The phystics engine cas be finnicky and unresponsive, doing something many players call ""awakening the kraken."" The mods are also very well made, other than the high quantity of troll mods in games like minecraft.. Kerbal Space Program is a space flight simulation video game developed by Mexican developer Squad. In the game, players direct a nascent space program, staffed and crewed by green humanoid aliens known as ""Kerbals"". The game features a realistic orbital physics engine, allowing for various real-life orbital maneuvers such as Hohmann transfer orbits and orbital rendezvous.. There are some games after you play and finish them, you remember, miss and want to play again. This is one of them. Whenever i see this game i'm thinking of playing it again.. ksp is a game that you never stop learning in and if in the off chance you get board of it you can always install mods!. it is one of the best games about there it is vary fun and interesting what you can do to the kerbals I alose have learned so much from this game about rockets and other things. ====================IIIIIIIIII GAME SCORE : 66 IIIIIIIIII====================. A fun game, however it is a bit disappointing that it hasn't expanded too much aside from parts through its updates, the game is basically seen as sandbox, but it is kind of disappointing that the available Campaign mode isn't fully polished, with many of the same missions, you also don't really get rewarded too much aside of a couple of milestones for experiencing with your own planes and space stations. 'Kerbal Space Program' may seem like a peaceful casual funny game but rather appears as a complete simulator. You won't have the courage to play it more than one hour if you don't stop sufficiently at the tutorials. And just when you think it can't be that hard to reach the stars, you suddenly realize that there are an impressive amount of parameters required just to visit the stratosphere without landing anywhere. The game strangely manages to give you the impression of total freedom when it doesn't allow you to go anywhere without following and understanding an incredible amount of rules. Each step you will achieve in order to reach an objective will demand you to dig deeper into the game mechanics. 'Kerbal Space Program' tries to be funny but I think its humour is totally obliterated by its incredible difficulty. Graphics seems effortless and do not help to truly get involved in the game. It is important to highlight the fact that 'Kerbal Space Program' benefits from a huge community that is hyper-active. Play it on Steam and you will easily disover plenty of crazy-original mods.. Honestly, one of the most clever games ever made. It's a shame about KSP2.. This is A Game Where You Can Make Rockets, And I Love It. I Learned So Much And Became A Space Fan With This. And With The KSP Community, You Can Make Mods In KSP.. Good game. The gameplay is not very good, this is the main disadvantage of the game. Acceleration works poorly in the game, problems with bugs. Interesting career, about 100 hours in the game. A career has marketing, missions, science. It seems to me that I want to become a space engineer. In this game, you need to learn a lot, helpers read books. The game is about 5 years old, but so little additional content, I would like more. The game is not perfect, there are many problems.. This one is one of my favorite games ever existed. I've played ~2000 hours, thanks to modding, and it never becomes too boring, there's always some new achievements to achieve and things to try, and there's a lot of things to learn about our world and orbital mechanics in this game, which can be understood intuitively, rather than memorizing some equations.. A good game with a novel concept that's bogged down by an extremely poorly designed UI. The art style is a bit inconsistent in some places. However, it has a very vibrant community of competent modders that help the PC version immensely.. Such a interesting take on the sci fi gameplay. I love the crafting aspect of the game where ur given full reigns of what you can create out of somewhat realistic choices. Enjoyed it thoroughly, had a hard time in the beginning tho can't lie, just play the tutorial if you dont wanna bumble (even the bumbling is fun) around like me !. Nearly perfect. In most other games, glitches can ruin the experience because you have a set objective, but in this game you can make crazy stuff with certain glitches and the quick save feature lets you go back in time to try to combat the glitch.. Awful game, terrible in-game guides, terrible physics, without soft you cant flight even to Dune. Replayability at it's best. This game could be played for hundred of hours exploring and developing and thinking. Obviously this isn't a game for everyone and not all would enjoy the complexity or general overhead. Overall, a great game.. Very basic game, not for everyone, and not for me, if you like a slow construction building mad scientist kind of thing this is for you, if not just stay away. This game is amazing. The ability to build your own spaceships and fly them is just awesome. I love exploring and landing crafts and building bases and SO much stuff. I also love the mod support and the ability to use mods to get so much more content out of the game. This game is pure fun.. It's unique and if you are motivated by seeing a goal and going for it step by step by learning the mechanics of the game, you will like it.. True masterpiece. Most realistic and addictive space program simulator. Cons only related to game performance and few bugs.. This game taught me the basics of Rocket Science, how orbits work and how to plan. It has given me an appreciation for Space Exploration. This is one of my favorite games, ever.. Probably one of the best games of all time. You can create anything you want and mod the hell out of this game. I have almost 800 hours and I still haven't seen most of the stuff in this game. A fantasticaly hard game and by hard I mean brain power, this game is made for the interlectuals out there. There is no guidance and you can build pretty much anything you can think of, but will it fly ? probably not but the explosions are a joy to watch. Eight years on from its first appearance, KSP would clearly benefit from a rewrite or replacement by something more polished. The rocket building and physics simulation are still a superb education in orbital mechanics, but it was never a great-looking game, was (and still is) plagued by bugs, and never really had a sense of game progression even in career mode. Visually and in gameplay, the modding community has far surpassed the original. Unfortunately installation and management of mods is complicated and poorly supported; few players will bother. KSP proved that there's demand for a gamified simulation of rocketry and orbital mechanics. The alternatives such as Orbiter and SimpleRockets are either extremely specialised or massively simplified, so for now it's your only option.. Kerbal Space Program is certainly in my top 5 games of all time. It was so refreshing to play a game that made me think and was incredibly fun at the same time, rather than the generic crap that just gets thrown in our faces all the time. The way the game incrementally pushes your thought to achieving milestones in space exploration is brilliant - just learning how to get a ship into orbit felt like a real achievement and gave me a better understanding of spaceflight. Then through to orbital rendezvous, fly by the moon, lading on the moon, going to Duna etc. all gave me a sense of accomplishment that I had solved how to overcome these challenges without much help at all.. This is possibly the best simulator you can buy right now. The physics engine is very impressive and the graphics are ok with the help of some mods. Furthermore there are many easy to install mods to keep you playing.. This game is the most played game in my steam library and is my favorite simulator game of all time. The amount of things you can do in this game is incredible and the physics are incredibly realistic. I have never been so addicted to a game before.. Kerbal space program has the potential to be on the top of my favourites list. However not speaking for the PC version. The console version is nearly unplayable. Countless bugs and crashes, and worst of all corrupted save files. I’ve lost numerous hours of progress because of corrupted saves. And nearly about to request my money back. I can’t suggest KSP to fellow gamers, let alone to children. Game is brilliant, and enjoyable besides the software issues though. But so many issues it’s disappointing. And I am hoping there is future attempts to remedy those issues, till then I don’t see it being worth anything over ten dollars. March 2018.. The beginning is perfect: In the long tutorial you get a great feeling of the perfect physics and complex gameplay. The setting is very unique, where did you ever manage a space center? After some hours the problem begin: The last tutorials are not very clear. There is no manual -> so many informations are hidden. You can loose your free time of your life to play the trial and error game, but I hate it. Or you can search in internet for more informations. But overall this is frustrating. Another big problem ist the missing localization. I understand english well, but I need to understand everything in a complex game. Somehow the atmosphere is boring and not motivating. The boring graphics fits into that **** campaign is a good idea: you get contracts and get science and other points to develop your space center. But the contracts are very similar. I have the feeling, the campaign needs improvements to be funny.. Kerbal is one of those games people will love or hate, not because there is anything wrong with it, but because of what you have to put into it. Sure you can sit down and play it for 5 minutes or 5 hours, that really isn't the issue. The game just has a HUGE learning curve. Running a space program takes a lot of work and a lot of trial and error. The tutorials will be a god send and will help, but you will fail a lot aiming for the stars and success. Failure is actually half the fun.. A lovely game for all ages, teaching what you need to be to go into space and getting people interested on the idea of space travel, it has it flaws a like any game like no multiplayer but there are mods for these exact reasons.. I learned so much from this game than I would from school. I have an appreciation of rocketry, orbital mechanics, and space exploration in general. After looking at game-play videos and trying the demo, I bought it on the day it was made available for Steam in 2013. Lots and lots of hours played and still playing to this day, I can safely say it's money well spent unlike certain $60 games. Learning curve is steep and YouTube videos help but you still have a lot to learn. I love it.. This game is really diverse and interesting, and makes you feel like a smartass once you get somewhere or suddenly get something. It is really educational as well, gravity assists, shuttles, bases, the limits are the universe. If you are a space guy, this is what you want to play.. I think that this is truly a unique game and I would recommend that if you are a fan of this type of genre then I think you should give this game a try.. You can do anything you want in this game, sure it has a steep learning curve but once you know what you're doing it is really rewarding. I rarely experience crashes or bugs and the game has great mod support.. It's a funny thing, a game like this. It's so rare to find a game that so perfectly encapsulates a simple idea. That idea of course is to be a part of a space program. And just like a real space program, your journey is filled with tragedy and loss, daunting odds, and impossible goals. You will crash, make no mistake. You will try and you will fail. But still you rise from the ashes of your defeat. You learn from every mistake, you know how to change yourself to get closer to your goal. You know that you can make it, and you know that you can figure out exactly how you will. And you will; you will make it. It's brilliant how a game so simple and childlike can so seamlessly speak on a human level like that. It's lighthearted tone will never get you down: The game is encouraging every step of the way, and your motivation carries that idea through: ""You can make it, it can be done."" Failure may be inevitable, but success is closer than you think. If Kerbal space program does nothing else, it does that perfectly: Encourage you to keep going. Keep trying. Never, ever, EVER give up. To judge KSP is to judge the human nature, our spirit and curiosity. Our determination, and our will to keep reaching a little higher. Our desire and yearning for the infinity of the stars.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A very impressive game. In fact it is not so much a game as a quite realistic space exploration simulator. The physics are amazingly well done, including aerodynamics, propulsion, heating, gravity and orbital vectors. It is a difficult proposition to get anywhere though, except perhaps directly into the nearest mountain if you can`t get your rocket to work. Just getting successfully into orbit took me about nine serious launches once I had the technology I needed to even try. And once I finally got there I ended up an obscenely eliptical orbit with no fuel, leaving my kerbal lost in space. Try again! And again and again... There are some bugs still, as you might expect. The silliest one happens if you go EVA at the surface of your home planet. The game actually behaves as if you`re in orbit and the Kerbal astronaut will levitate above the landed craft as if he`s weightless. In fact, kerbal EVA behavior is one of the least compelling parts of the game, because it`s at the moment both buggy and fiddly. But these small issues will be fixed shortly I`m sure. There is also a lack of a more hardcore option to enable life support for even more realism. As far as I know a kerbal can stay on the Moon forever with nothing but his space suit while waiting for a rescue mission. It`s forgiving but not exactly immersive. At least not for me. But the game is weirdly addictive all the same. Every launch can teach you something if you`re paying attention; either about how not to build rockets and ships or about the ideal angle to go for to find stable orbit and just loads of other things. Success feels very rewarding because of all this trial and error and because the game doesn`t cheat you. If you build a good ship you`ll probably get things done. Build a bad one and you`ll explode in a fireball or indeed get lost in space. There are also an absolute ton of components of various kinds to research and build, astronauts to train and things to see; if you can get there. The game takes place in a solar system with several planets and many many moons. And everywhere you go you do science, which is a sort of currency to unlock more gear for your ships. Every planet has several biotopes and you can do many experiments in each one. It also matters at what altitude you do the experiments and completionists may develop aneurisms trying to keep track of what they have missed and not in this complex web of research objects. All in all it`s deep and excellent fun. It is also a rewarding learning experience for people who want to find out about physics, astronomy (Made up astronomy in a fictional solar system mind you.) and aviation. The quality of both the physics simulation, the economic simulation and the science simulation can`t be overstated. It is all absolutely magnificent. And still you can see room for improvement all over the place. Not because the game is really missing anything but because the scope is such that you could add to it forever. More details on planet surfaces, more variation of missions for you to complete in the campaign mode, more ship parts, more types of astronauts and of course life support features. There is an endless potential here for as long as the developers are able to keep it going with patches and expansions. If they do then Kerbal Space Program could well become an all time classic. In fact it`s almost there already. And the interface is superb to go along with all this, including the intuitive and brilliant ship designer. You can do absolutely anything you want with it, including deliberately putting all your engines off center so you crash into the nearest building or placing engines upside down or at weird angles. You can even put kerbals in separate components and jettison them in sub orbit so they crash and die. None of that will get you to the moon of course, or anywhere else for that matter. But it`s such great game design to allow you to do it anyway. If you want to open your parachute and decouple the capsule before launch and then fire your engine so everything disintegrates in a shower of exploding fuel containers right above the launch pad you can. If you want to make a plane with one wing so you careen into the grasslands and explode when you fire up the engine, you can. The amount of ways you can fail in this game is staggering, but this freedom of choice is to a large degree what makes KSP such a pleasure to play. Having said all this, the game is certainly not for everyone. Unless you enjoy solving problems, a certain degree of meticulous planning and unless you have a lot of patience and perseverance then you might become very frustrated with Kerbal Space Program. Learning how to do everything right here is a tall order for anyone, and failure is inevitable. Lots and lots of failure. For everyone else though I can`t recommend it highly enough. To those who like all of this, as I do, KSP is a perfect game.. Best game I've ever played, very steep learning curve, even steeper withdrawing curve! This is the only game I've been playing for more than 2 years and I'm sure everyone who has the passion for space and the patience to chew through many tutorials will absolutely love it too!. I'm Aerospace Engineer, so it's the perfect game for me. It's amazing! I have Space Stations orbiting over the Moon and others planets, and some bases with Kerbals. It's like a virtual Meccano, but with space theme. You have some parts, and you have to design a space ship with these parts. And the whole of parts have to work properly to have a successful mission, and it isn't easy. There are a lot of things that could go wrong. 10/10. This is probably the best and the most useful sandbox game ever. Get your understanding of space flight and orbital mechanics in one evening. Modding community is awesome too. From stronger struts to warp drives and nuclear explosion-powered engines – they've got it covered. :-). Kerbal Space Program (I have the Steam version) is a fun game to bring out the inner LEGO child in you and build a spaceship. What is your goal? Your goal is to get to the Moon, land on the moon, plant a flag and get back to earth. Within this time of building, you might cuss out the spaceship for losing fuel too fast or even cuss it out when it doesn't go to the path you want it to go. Maybe even when you land on the moon, you completely ran out of fuel? Well, now it's time for planning so that you can build a better spaceship, plan accordingly and save those Kerbals that you left on the moon so you can get them back to the launch station. You can spend hours on this game and no matter the cause, you will actually have fun in this game. Note: If you find it difficult. You can always download mods to help the spaceship fly better, get a better spaceship or even update the visuals if you want a better detailed galaxy.. Have you ever wondered if it's possible to make an ""educational game"" that is actually fun? Here's your answer. This game will make you WANT to learn about orbital mechanics, because that's how you get your rockets to stay up. That's how you can get them to meet in space so you can dock. And build space stations. And land on other planets and moons. Getting something off the ground is easy. Even getting something out of the atmosphere isn't that hard yet. And then you start to learn. Because you want that to succeed. You start calculating how much delta-V you need for orbit. You start to understand why single-stage to orbit (i.e. no dropping of spent stages) is but a wet dream. You start to wrap your mind around complicated formulas for the sake of building better rockets. Not because it is easy, but because it is hard. We're not talking about a ""serious"" simulation here, mind you. It's still heaps easier to get anything done in KSP than in reality. The planet is much smaller and easier to launch from. Your launch site is exactly at the equator and the ""Mun"" (the moon orbiting the planet) is on an equatorial orbit. That makes some things easier. And once you managed to deal with all that, you start to add one of the hundreds of (free) mods. That will improve the aerodynamic of the game. And add new challenges. There is now even a mod that changes the game to the point where you are essentially dealing with our real solar system. And communication delay. And, and, and. If you enjoy games that challenge your mind in a scientific (or at least pseudo-scientific) way, download the demo and give it a spin. Don't blame me if you lose sleep over it, though!. The Best space exploration game ever made. If u like space if u dont like space if u like space exploration if u dont like space exploration BUY IT if u just like sand box BUY IT AND LOVE IT if u dont like sand box with achievements and ur own story to write well..... **** you. I hate Kerbal Space Program... No wait, I'm just angry because I spent 3 hours building and flying a ship to Minmus and the sodding thing crashed because I let the new girl drive it. Jesus, what was I thinking, she was the same girl that somehow survived last years docking crash. Brilliant game. Needs a few little tweaks to make idiots like me understand what the hell I am doing sometimes (see docking, above) but otherwise brilliant.. This game is for everyone, who like space, rockets, physics, build strategy and fun in great mix. It takes some time, before you fully understand how to play, but it is fun. You are a leader of the space program and you are able to do everything what is somehow connected with space like create space-tourist vessels, space stations, explore asteroids, moons or other planets, build planes for planet explore and a lot of more. There is a whole solar system with many planets, moons, asteroids and also a star. And the star is not just some source of light, it is real object, that you can explore. You can build a vessel like you want, but you have to thing about real physics like aerodynamic, weight, thrust, breaking devices,, vessel protection and many other things. It Is a fiction space, but it is similar with the real. Everything works great, game looks good and although it looks like some comedy thing, the game works with real physics and do it well. Problem could be random bugs (dancing airplane, problem with visibility of UI in the administration building, strange crashes - when symmetrical rocket is turning after start...) . But developers still working on patches and game is periodically updated. Summary it is a great, funny and science based game with a face, but with some smaller bugs and still visible space to improve.. Space the final frontier, to boldly go where no Kerbal has gone before. The most wonderful physics and gravity and space tool you can have fun in a virtual sand box to explore not only space but Kerbin itself. I give this game a 100+++. Does space even exist? Dead Kerbals don't write reports so I might never find out, but in the mean time I'm having great fun scattering bits and pieces of rockets and Kerbal around. The game is missing only two things; the option to leave crashed rockets lying around and cities to fly my ICBMs... erm...I mean accidentally crash my spaceships into.. An interesting space simulation game which has developed massively over the many months which I have owned this game. With the official release version, I did expect more issues to be fixed and for some graphical improvements to certain things, however not enough was changed in my opinion. KSP is not quite as user friendly as I had expected with the official release, however the game still provides an enjoyable set of mechanics and great gameplay.. This game is definitely up there with Spore and Minecraft. It's very similar to them too, and has a unique lego-esque building setup not before seen anywhere else. It's a space flight simulator with a 3 game modes: Sandbox, Career, and Science. Science mode has you start with a couple parts, which you throw together in the shape of a rocket, blast off, and do reports, collect surface samples and read gauges. These readings and samples when returned to Kerbin, equivocally Earth, award you science points. The Research and Development dept. takes these in return for better parts of your desired category, effectively upgrading your supplies. Career mode is this with a monetary feature. Agencies offer contracts, like ""test this part at this altitude"", and fulfilling them gives you Kerbfunds. These in turn allow you to upgrade facilities, and also have more parts to a ship, because parts cost cash. There's also a trade-in type thing, where you can exchange one type of thing for something else, with one strategy being outsourcing RnD to exchange Reputation for Science points. Reputation, by the way, is something you get for NOT crashing your ship and catastrophically ending the mission. Sandbox mode is my favorite because you don't need to worry about going overbudget or not having enough science. You're free from the start to build the biggest things you can. This is where it all ties together, because far enough into the game and it doesn't matter what mode you use. You can do anything at all, like land on the Mun, (a play on Moon), send a rover to Duna, (In-game mars) even fly a jumbojet to the north pole! Or, for the rather ","the game was released over 9 years ago and still holds its place as a very engaging space exploration simulator . i got the game for my birthday and I was like ""oh!, my friends say I'm a genius or something, this is going to be another simulator!"" overall, the game is really fun as long as you have the brain power ."
541.Age of Empires II: The Conquerors Expansion,"The perfect expansion to probably the best RTS of all time. It is still played massively to this day.. Expansions to one of the best RTS games can not be bad, right? The Conquerors extends the greatness of AoE 2 and is simply amazing by itself aswell. It remains well balanced and offers a lot of fun to spend your time, either alone or with friends.. One of the games i've spend hours in both singleplayer and multiplayer during my elementary school days.. One of the best RTS games got expanded even more, and it's a perfect add-on. I always loved to play in the America and fight the invading Spaniards.. This is the game that I spent the most hours playing in my life. The world can invent several strategy games. But this one is unsurpassed in terms of simplicity and gameplay. This expansion is the best ever invented!. Note: This is a review of Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors single player campaign. I am aware that the multiplayer is where Age of Empires is at its strongest and this review does not cover the multiplayer experience. This expansion is everything the original game wanted to be. As opposed to the formulaic and somewhat tedious campaigns of Age of Kings, each campaign mission is carefully designed in AoE II: The Conquerors. The narrative is better, missions offer enough variety, everything feels more balanced and the difficulty is just right. Age of Kings was a great game for its time. The Conquerors, on the other hand, escalates Age of Empires to a masterpiece level and can easily be considered a timeless classic. 9.5/10. This is a perfect game. It's well balanced and well thought through. The campaign mode is awesome as well.. This game is just like Age of Empires 2: Age of Kings, but with more civilizations, limited difficulty modes, and additional tools/tactics that's never been seen before in the Age of Empires franchise. From looking at the critics, they don't like it as much as Age of Empires 2: Age of Kings; it's probably because there's not much new things going on, that a few additional tools/tactics didn't affect them as much as the additional tools/tactics difference between Age of Empires 2 and Age of Empires 1. But still, if you like Age of Empires 1 & 2 or just 2, you'll like this one too, for they're no different from each other.. The games is about 16 years and still it manage to be the best strategy game I've ever play. Everything is balanced, there is no one-win-solution. I recommend it.. One of the top 10 best PC games of all time, of any genre! The gameplay is outstanding and balanced. Multiplayer and single player, as well as campaign.... all are near-perfect. The modding capability, the AI scripting possibilities, the sound, and even the 2-D graphics. Superb. With the recent updates to allow it to run on modern hardware, and new expansions, makes it unique in the annals of PC gaming history. Game designers of today could take a lesson regarding gameplay, pathfinding, attention to detail, and what really make an awesome game which large numbers of people still are willing to pay and play, almost 20 years later.. The best strategy game i've played. The multiplayer is very fun and the campaign mode also, each civilization have unique units. The map editor have a lot of features. I recommend.. My first PC game in memory ever. And the best of Age of Empires family. The game is in great balance, and the models have the best historic feelings in the series.. Fantastic expansion to a fanstastic game, hands down the best game of all time. Other than the new maps and civilizations, this expansion also brought many tweaks and fixes to the original, like being able to que farms at the mill, which saved a lot of frustration.. The best strategy game for me. Played thousands of hours with my brothers over LAN & then in Internet. If you are looking for modern day graphics this is not the game for you, if you go for game play over graphics keep on reading. Cons: - Not the best AI, game difficulty is set by giving additional resources to computer player in the start. - Extremely addictive Pros: - No 2 games alike - Many civilizations to play - Still active game rooms for competitive multi-player game play after a decade, check through ""GameRanger"" - Addition to built in game types, various community created game types to play. - You can have a loads of fun by just watching a recorded game which consist of computer players. - With map editor you can create your own game scenarios. - After all that community created Forgotten Empires expansion pack with new civilization with improved game play for more fun.. This some the best game in strategy game I have played. The graphic feels like you are looking at a board game like chess from a 3d view. But still it is a fun time playing it.. One of my top 10 games of all times. This made me interested in the medieval period and history and gave thousand of well-spent hours. This was a definite milestone in the history of gaming!. incredibly fun, still offers great deal of playability. the community is far from dead and great amount of fun comes with the modding. on heavengames there exists many tools to mod and also many mods and extensions to the game... This is probably the best strategy game ever! My family still plays this game, It's amazing! So what if the graphics are old, it's still **** a good game and it may not seem like its a very deep game but trust me it is.. Oh how I loved thee! This was one of my first online RTS games and remains all time favorite till today! No wonder I am giving it a 10! A perfectly balanced game with fun elements (Monks!) that allow deep strategy and re-playability that lasts decades. Bring'em on!","""the conquerors"" is the perfect expansion to probably the best RTS of all time . it extends the greatness of AoE 2 and is simply amazing by itself aswell . critics don't like it as much as Age of Empires 2: Age of Kings ."
542.Diddy Kong Racing,"Rare reinvents the kart racing genre with fresh ideas: a hub world, unique bosses, coins, unlockables, and secrets. The driving takes some getting used to and it can be maddeningly difficult, but its charm is irresistible.. Controls have aged poorly. But it's still one of best kart racers ever. Too bad the sequel/s were cancelled.. This game is easily top 3 kart racers of all time and they managed to make a skill based item system that isn't random luck. More kart racers need to take notes from that. Add techniques like green boosting and you got one heck a game. It's also better than Mario Kart 64 in my opinion.. Not only the best racing game on the Nintendo 64, but also the best racing game of the generation. Rareware was pumping out bangers left and right on this system.. Although the selection of different vehicles, charming cast of adorable critters, fire soundtrack and vivid, colourful and stunning visuals are all what make this game fun, the adventure mode can prove to be very a tedious and difficult chore at times when you have to constantly collect all the balloons and keys in every course and I sincerely don't have the patience for that, I just wanna kick Wizpig's ass already lmao. The controls haven't really aged well either and can be hard to use but other than that pretty solid game I guess. One of the better Mario Kart clones out there but the single player game lacks challenge and it's just not as good as its inspiration.. For its time, this game is insanely good in almost every aspect. I love it. It's one of my favorite games ever, to the point that I recently picked up an N64 for the first time in almost two decades just so I could shell out even more money on a copy of this game - and just this game for the time being. It holds up. It shows its age, of course, it's over 20 years old. But all things considered, this holds up surprisingly well. For my entire life, I have stood beside my opinion that Diddy Kong Racing is superior to Mario Kart 64 in almost every way, and I still believe this. This game has to come back. Not a shoddy port, but a full-blown legitimate remake. This is all I want from Nintendo, and it's all I've wanted forever. Pls, Nintendo. Bring this game back.. There is so much fun. It even has a story. Furthermore you can drive as a car, dinghy or a plane.. The best kartraecer ever. Fun to have plane car and hovercraft. Maybe a little bit difficult to set up a multiplayer race but still a sure 10.. Another one of my favorite games growing up. My brother has beaten this more than I have tho lol.. I think it's a masterpiece, even much better than all Mario Kart versions. Diddy Kong Racing OST is amazing, the different worlds have their own aesthetics. Bosses are a very good idea included in its story. I would love to see a remasterization of this videogame.. A great alternative to Mario Kart 64! Awesome characters to choose from and you can select different vehicles. Not only does it serve as a great multiplayer game but it's rewarding for single players as well! It's another N64 classic from Rareware!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A great karting game although comparisons are inevitable with mario kart. In my opinion it is superior to its direct competition as it added new features like airplanes or ships. Good soundtrack. Essential.. Just played through this game for the first time since release. It brought back memories of when games were pure fun. The coin challenges are somewhat difficult on some maps but what a great nostalgia trip it was. Just as good as back in the day.. This game basically gave me a mental breakdown as a small child, and I couldn't recommend it more to anyone. Diddy Kong Racing is a true masterpiece.. It should come as a shock to see that no remakes have been done since the original release of the title. This is a game that combines the best of racing with a platform feel. I had this game growing up and remember spending hours playing it. I recently bought it again and it is just as I remembered it to be.. This is the only Racing kart game I played and enjoyed. It has fun story and some room to explore.. With adorable visuals, great track design, fantastic music, awesome roster, fantastic adventure mode, and vehicle variety, this really might be the best kart racer on the N64 thanks to the sheer amount of content and fun times this brings.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. The best Mario Kart 64 copy-cat of the late 90's, Diddy Kong Racing had a great roster, fun story mode, great race tracks, and an amazing kart selection system that today has never been truly matched.. This game had its moments. It wasn't as good as Mario Kart, but at least it tried. I did enjoy the different vehicles; the cart, the airplane, and the boat. I also liked the central hub of the game, this is something that Mario Kart should adopt!. This game was so hard honestly, I am not trying to say that it is impossible but even to this day I can not beat this game. I know that I am not that good at racing games and I often find that I struggle with even some of the easy ones but this one was insane. I tried for so long to beat this game but I just never could. I'm sure there are people that think the game is easy and I respect that but I could just never find it in myself to fully beat the game. I know I will never get the chance again however because this is a game that was developed by rare and the rights are spread all over the place.. It's an amazing kart game that shows that not only Mario Kart is the good kart game. Diddy Kong Racing has a cute cast of characters with an amazing story, I recommend you buy it.. A story mode Mario Kart with multiple vehicles and multi level power ups is exactly what this game is. With that being said this game has a lot of depth to it and is one of the most underrated multiplayer games of all time.. This game really challenged Mario Kart. Too bad there were never any sequels. I thought the single player adventure mode was far more fun than playing Mario Kart 64 alone. The multiplayer modes were fun as well, but I always thought Mario Kart 64 had a slight advantage in that department.. This game gets compared to Mario Kart 64 a lot, but there are things that each game does better (and differently) than each other. While MK64 has better Battle Mode and the multiplayer racing is pretty equally good between them, the Adventure Mode in DKR is phenomenal. Alone or with a friend, you navigate the overworld and complete races and challenges and even fight bosses. MK64 is for multiplayer. DKR is for adventure.. This game was way better than anything i was expecting. I personally prefer this over Mario Kart 64. It's an amazing game and Diddy Kong's finest hour in video games.. At a first glance, Diddy Kong Racing doesn't look all that special but there's a good reason it has stayed my all time favorite racing game for this long. DKR is jam packed full of content. Tons of characters, maps, battle stages, collectables, and more make DKR feel as much like a single player adventure as it does a multiplayer racing game. When your add the mirrored courses and silver coin missions to the mix, there is a ton of content in the main campaign. I haven't even mentioned the multiple vehicles, which not only add variety to the game overall, but to each stage as well as many stages are designed around multiple vehicles with alternate routes and shortcuts to discover. The stackable powerup upgrades are also something that makes this game more fun and unique. Great music, graphics, gameplay, and variety makes this game special.. I was fortunate enough to receive a Nintendo 64 in 1996 at the age of 4, Mario was my first game. My older sister and I poured our free time into this wonderful world. Our second 2 games were Mario Party 1 & Diddy Kong racing. For me Diddy kong racing was exactly what I wanted because similar to Mario64; single player mode was a unique adventure. While the multiplayer mode is equally as fun, just in a different way. Of course Mario Cart has something special that Diddy Kong Racing simply does not have. However, as a whole game Diddy Kong Racing. This game is nostalgic and amazing. I think its better than Mario Kart 64 and that is most of the time said the best racer on the N64 but this game has more and is MORE nostalgic.. Who knew that racing and a fun campaign mixed so well together! That's exactly what Diddy Kong Racing did. Full of fun and iconic characters from different games, challenging race tracks and challenges, crazy bosses, and even a good time racing. This isn't your typical racing game. If you like Mario Kart you'll like this game as well.. Diddly kong racing is a great racing game it's like mario kart but it's different in the same way. You race in karts ,boats and planes The level design is great and it's an amazing game buy it now. This is really hard for me to say but its the truth, this game is way better than MarioKart 64. I think that it was just so much better than a simple kart game. This was a weird, creepy, and the best part tons of fun! The whole point of this game was to kill a pig king or some really lame story that no one really carries about, but the thing that people really liked was the way you raced. I was like a 6 year old the last time I played this game and will always love the fact that you can pick a character that really you never heard of other than diddy, banjo, and the other monkey girl that was DK's sister, other than that the characters were all unknown and that was the best cause it felt like an original game even tho really this characters were over shadowed by the giant blue elephant genie that was always in my nightmares and will never leave. The actual races were the best you moves from the road to the sky and the water, this game was very awesome and it only took almost twenty years for Mariokart to steal this and make it there own. I love this game and I hate racing games, one of the greats for one of the best systems ever.. First off I love this game! It's just as fun as Mario Kart, but with carts, hovercrafts, and planes. The gameplay is fun, the music rocks, and the graphics are beautiful. Diddy Kong Racing is just awesome. Score: 4/5.. Real fun to play and easy better then mario kart 64 with the graphics and all the vehicles in it.. Not all companies can make as fun of a kart racer as Nintendo did with Mario Kart, but Rare was a very close second on the N64 with Diddy Kong Racing. As with other competitive ""racers,"" such as Mario Kart and 1080, this game will have you screaming in joy as your friends pass you again after you just barely nudged ahead. The controls are very fluid and work well even with the N64's oft-awkward controller. Rare made another blockbuster with this game.. Mario Kart-style racer with the characters from Donkey Kong. Long and funny game, very addictive. Although it copies Mario Kart, also DKR knows how to bring some new ideas like planes (so you can fly instead of just drive). Very good game in general terms.. Have any of you played through the full adventure mode? Okay this game is fuun, and adds alot more to mario karts formula. but the single player adventure gets SO BORING! if i remebre, you have to beat like every track 4-5 times just to beat the adventure mode... and i did. Oh and when you do that, you can do adventure 2... all of the tracks are just backwards... ADVENTURE HO!. A copy-cat of Mario Kart 64 , nether-less is a packed fun game with more interactions and more diversity in the tracks. In fact, it could be even better than Mario Kart 64. The music tunes reminds good times for those that played back then.. What a great game. You could spend hours and hours on this and not notice. A great game to play on your own or with a group of friends. One of the best games of the N64 era.","controls haven't aged well, but it's still one of the best kart racing games ever . for its time, this game is insanely good in almost every aspect . it shows its age, of course, it's over 20 years old . but all things considered, this holds up surprisingly well ."
543.Tribes 2,"I spent many hours as a tween in this amazing team FPS. It's precedessor was the first game I played online and though I never excelled at either of them, the games were so fun to play that I never really cared. Truly a gem of yore.. Epic game, great player control, tough learning curve, but it's epic once you get the hang of it. Still being played today. The community has set up their own master server, that's how awesome it is!. innovate game play (skiing, jet-packs) combined with large maps, solid vehicles, semi customisable bases and deployable equipment. huge player counts (forget 8v8 or 16v16- it is usually 32v32 or even 64v64). very, very customisable characters (choose each and every weapon, grenade, pack) that can be changed between quickly (without even having to suicide like other games of genre). easy to use, very useful pre-set voice commands, huge scope for teamwork. it had it all, and is still (in my opinion) the best online game ever made -comparing it to everything to date.","the community has set up their own master server, that's how awesome it is! innovate game play (skiing, jet-packs) combined with large maps, solid vehicles, semi customisable bases and deployable equipment . easy to use, very useful pre-set voice commands, huge scope for teamwork ."
544.Star Fox 64,"Honestly star fox 64 is easily one of the best games on the n64 both gameplay wise but also in the way that it fits the n64 so well, some made tge jump to 3d better than others and sf64 did it beautifully, the gameplay music visuals setpieces all make an impression on you. This is one of the best shoot em up arcade games ever. I've replayed it multiple times. It is a really good game to pick up and play. The game is perfect except for the length. This was my first n64 game growing up and although I don’t think it's the best game on the n64, i do believe it’s entirely underrated.. For me, the definition or fun. Completely addictive, fast paced, something that makes you forget about your dull and meaningless existence. The reason I took the route to retro gaming. Star Fox on SNES was mind blowing but the technical possibilities of the N64 pushed it to its full potential. I reckon that I used some cheat codes, because the game is quite hard. What the subsequent iterations of Star Fox failed to convey is this sense of urgency and danger that you feel every second you play Star Fox 64.. Star Fox 64 is a timeless classic and one of the most replayable games ever! The interesting dialogue is memorable and the game itself is very quotable. Flying around in space and shooting up stuff has always been such a blast for me. Growing up, this was one of my favorite video games to play and to this day it still is. I remember getting this game with a rumble pak, my memory also recalls figuring out how to unlock the hard path and beating the game that way. Once you beat it, it feels so rewarding! My favorite levels from Star Fox 64 are Corneria, Meteo, Zoness, Area 6, and Venom. There's lots of other fascinating levels from this game. Fox is a lot of fun to play as, he's an interesting character because he doesn't talk much but he's determined to accomplish each mission. There's also never a dull moment when he communicates with his teammates, Falco, Peppy, and Slippy. The aircraft battles with Star Wolf were not only memorable, but so was Andross who was the final boss as he turned into a brain. There have been other good Star Fox games that came out of this franchise, but in my opinion, they were never as great or charming as this game.. I've recently beaten this game a few days ago and my god it still holds up to this day! Here are my my top 4 games within the series 1: Star Fox 64 2: Star Fox Assault 3: Star Fox Adventures 4: Star Fox Zero The last time I've beat this game was when I was just a small kid and to relive the good ending once again still feel the same.. The game holds up, it's an amazing on rails branching space shooter that even Nintendo has yet to be able to improve upon or refine. It's hard but rewarding, the stages and bosses are diverse and look good. It's a must have for the N64. The only thing that keeps it from perfect are nit picks, no multiplayer for the story mode, no option to use other characters. I didn't play this game till 2023, despite having an N64 when I was a child. I have now learned I had a sub par childhood, don't make the same mistake.. Star Fox the Phantom Menace is the most disappointing thing since my first wedding night. How are you even supposed to aim your big blasters with this controller? I keep having to use my toesies to press the C buttons: you gotta have like 6 arms and at least 34 fingers to straddle this plastic trident of a controller. And they clearly didn't heed any mind to mouth feel with this pathetic waste of plastic of a cartridge. I know this game was made in the 1800s or whatever, but come on, I can fit at LEAST 13 Switch cartridges in my mouth. I doubt I could cram more than 2 or 3 Star Fox carts in my craw, and that's just pathetic. There is literally only one good thing about Star Fox 64 and it's my luscious baby boy Pigma. Pigma is real. I am going to kiss him. He will be my lover. I will be the little spoon. Me and Pigma will **** and you can't stop us. Playing Star Fox feels like a spider web is your boyfriend, and I will never understand how Nintendo got away with it.. I rate the game miserable because I find it an insult to not give the player the option to disable these idiotic inverted controls. This is an arcade game, not a simulation. As an STG player, it really gives me a headache after 2 minutes.. Great controls, infinitely replayable, a memorable cast, great music, and a tough but fair difficulty. Worth it.. AKA Lylat Wars, the early Star Fox games always looked rather better than they played but it's a well presented if slightly superficial 3D blaster that's still quite good fun to play, if a little lacking in challenge for veterans.. Great game with tons of replayability, a fun multiplayer mode, excellent soundtrack, and some hilarious lines.. you play as the funny dog man from smash bros and go ""pew pew"" with space lasers to make the big monkey head go boom.. A masterful reimaging of the SNES title, 64 cemented the series as a Nintendo staple. This version isn't quite as good as the 3DS remaster, but it's still incredibly fun and the blocky visuals and choppy performance have their own charm to them.. Star Fox 64 oh boy where to begin. Well as it turns out Foxs can't drive, seriously when is the last time you've seen a fox steer a plane or whatever they are called. Rumble Pack? What exactly is it rumbling, the only thing rumbling right now is my stomach, I haven't eaten yet today because I got so mad at this game. Laser? - But why, and when are they needed when you got ... Bombs - HELL YA BRUDDER KKonaW Braking? - I wanna go fast, not slow. Boosting? - Damn right Fly Straight? - More Like Fly under the radar Peppy - AWW MUSTID, YOU GOTTA PUT A LITTLE SEASNIN ON DAT THANG. Slippy - Sliders Falco - F U is what I wrote in 2nd grade, got sent to the time-out corner on a metal chair. Wolf - on Wall Street Plastic Utopia is better than this game that I can attest, but, I do know it beats out the rest. For now, I depart, while I go to malo mart. This is the end, but, I need to first go around the bend. It's not easy, but, I do know it seems cheesy. Just because you won't doesn't mean you can't have a boat. Trees are neat, but, I bet you can't handle this sick beat.. Star Fox 64 is a great game. I believe that the Star Fox series peaked on the N64. The overall gameplay is just so fun. It honestly feels like an arcade game, but cranked up super high. The story is fine. Although the story is definitely not the focus here. It's the gameplay. It is super fun to just blow up some guys. The game shouldn't take you an hour, but if you want to take all the routes it will definitely take you more than an hour. It isn't just shooting guys you have to also protect your teammates so they will be in the next battle with you. We don't really get to know the characters here, but what we have I like. I can't really think of anything wrong with it. It just isn't anything phenomenal. I wish Metacritic let you give numbers like 6.5, 7.5. But anyways I give Star Fox 64 an A- and a 8.5/10.. Star Fox 64 is the game that I have replayed and completed more than any other game I have ever played. It's one of the most fun and addicting games I have ever experienced that is damn near close to perfection (it may get a 10, but that doesn't automatically the game doesn't have any blemishes). To this day, this is peak Star Fox, and I am still surprised they haven't been able to come close to achieving a similar level of quality since then. SF64 is, for all intents and purposes, a remake of the SNES original. Fox McCloud and gang of furries set off to liberate the Lylat System from the evil Andross. The most noticeable difference between this game and the original is in its presentation. Of course, the graphics are an obvious boost (and still look great for the time), but now each character in the game is fully voiced. This game is endlessly quotable and memorable for a good reason. Each of the characters are wholly unique from each other and have the perfect level of camp. The sound design is excellent, with incredibly satisfying, crunchy explosions, laser fire and roaring engine of the Arwing. The soundtrack, while not quite as good as the SNES game, is still solid in its own right. Another factor that differentiates this game from the original is in its progression. Like the original, there are multiple paths to take that lead you to different planets that vary in difficulty. However, you can now mix up that path depending what mission you accomplish within the stage. It can range from finding an alternate path, shooting down a certain number of enemies, altering the route of a cargo train, etc. How you set your path up can lead you to one of two endings, and only one of them is the true one. Much of this game's replayability comes from exploring all of the different pathways available. While not all of the stages are winners, each one is unique in its own way, preventing things from getting stale. The game also offers multiple vehicle types (first used in Star Fox 2): The Land Master and Blue Marine. You only get to use these in a few stages, however. The Land Master takes a bit of getting used to, but is still really fun. The Blue Marine, though, is too slow for my liking. The Arwing, though, is still the king, and man does it control like a dream. The N64's controller was tailor made for this game and it just isn't quite the same when playing it on other systems. Each level has a score requirement that you can achieve that reward you with a medal, and getting the medals in some of these stages can be pretty tricky. Getting all the medals in each stage will reward you with an Expert Mode (also with its own set of medals). If you thought the base game was too easy, this one will definitely put up more of a fight (it also comes with a **** pair of shades for Fox). This is easily one of the best games you can ever own on the N64. If you are even remotely interested in the series, you need to pick this up in some form, whether it's an original copy or the 3DS Remake (which is stellar).. Super addictive star fox saga game with charismatic characters and dialogues that have starred in countless memes. One of the most replayable games on the Nintendo 64 and a soundtrack of 10.. Played it on the Wii's Virtual Console. I dare to say that the game aged pretty well throughout the years. I really enjoyed visiting the world of Star Fox and can't recommend the game enough for N64, 3DS ( it's been remastered for the 3DS) or any Virtual Console owners. A great shooter from Nintendo which is still very playable and fun even nowadays.. Fast, satisfying and most importantly, incredibly fun with a plenty of ways to have it, with awesomely designed levels where not a single one of them is similar to the other. In my opinion, this the best game of all time, no words, hands down.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. With stunning visuals voice acting, and memorable soundtrack, this game really is a nice addition you can make to your N64 gallery.. Still the best in the series, sadly (though I highly recommend the 3DS remake, which is technically a better game and features lots of improvements and enhancements). The gold standard for space shooters on rails, with tons of personality and fun. My only complaint is the lack of a save feature.. ""DO A BARREL ROLL!"" Do I need to say anything more? LOL! This game was fun. The flying and shooting was fun. The game looked good for the time. I really hope Nintendo puts this on the N64 mini!!!. Classic game and had alternate endings and paths. Game was killer on multiplayer too and hopefully Nintendo can make a new Star Fox game with 24 team online multi player.. Game: Star Fox 64 Genre: Rail Shooter Publisher/Developer: Nintendo System: Nintendo 64 (N64) Total Score: 84/100 Value Score: 8.4/10 • Story: 8/10 • Characters: 9/10 • GamePlay: 8/10 • Graphics: 8/10 • Sound: 10/10 • Music: 9/10 • Length: 6/10 • Replay Value: 8/10 • Player Value: 8/10 Pros +Improved visuals +Improved voice acting +Story and characters improved from SNES version +3 different paths like the first game with each one being a different set of difficulty Cons -Very short -No control option like the SNES version -Voice acting from some characters can be annoying (i.e. Slippy) -Allies have bad AI when it comes to getting support in battle -In order to get to other areas , you must accomplish certain task to get a alternate end result of each level. This game is amazing with it's graphics and amazing level design! The plot is good. The controls feel perfect for the N64 but the only bad thing is slippy....... One the classics and most memorable games in the N64 library. The polygon graphics, gameplay, story, and dialog are so memorable and influential, that Star Fox games today still try and model their design around this game. Pros: -Who would've thought that polygon graphics could look so good? -Controls is fluent and comfortable -The characters are lovable and the dialog is ridiculous, yet alluring -Iconic music that sounds even better on a soundtrack Cons: -Get your s*** together, Slippy -For a console that now allows saving features either in the game or from a memory card, for Star Fox, there is still NO SAVE FEATURE!. Star Fox 64 doesn't feel like a sequel to the original Star Fox game. According to the Internet, it was revealed that Star Fox 2 would be the sequel to the original Star Fox game, but that was cancelled all together. Star Fox 64, on the other hand, feels more like a remake of the original Star Fox game for your Nintendo 64 and it manages to hold what the original has in hand.. Solid graphics, extremely high replay value, interesting characters and levels, sufficient story-line...even the sound effects and music are pretty legit. Almost twenty years later, and this N64 game is still fun to play.. Seriously? This is a Star Fox game? Where did Master Chief go exactly? Where are the mini games after each turn? This is by far, the worst Star Fox game to date. I can't believe this was actually made. Why is tripping still in the game? Why are the guns so unbalanced? I would love to have all of these questions answered, but it still wouldn't fix this broken game.. Do i hear worst star fox game ever? There aren't mini mushrooms in this one, And for some reason you can't ground pound Ridiculous!! and worst of all there is no super sonic power up.. This game is awesome fun. The story is cheesy but I loved the characters as a kid (and still do) and the missions were varied and always fun (as well as challenging). Being unable to save during the single-player was a bit of a pain however and the game was pretty short but very high on replay value. The multiplayer was really fun too although it could have done with a few more maps or modes. It's still my favourite space-shooter to this day.. This is the game that got me into star fox even though I played it through emulation. I think this game is the best in the franchise and is by far the fastest. This game also offers some of the best graphics that the n64 is capable of along with good quality music ( not always good though). The joystick makes the game play smoothly and the controls are easy to learn because peppy tells you during the level like how to do a barrel roll at the begining. Some bad things are fairly minor but beware on the last level there is a possibility you won't go down the tunnel to the final boss you must reset the game. Overall a good game with a major bug that is rare to find But I say get it on the 3ds if you don't have an n64 or if you have an emulator I say download it. Graphics: 8.0 Sound: 9.0 Gameplay: 9.0 Fun/Story: 8.2 Good graphics (one of the first N64 games), great replay value and outstanding gameplay. Good multiplayer.. Star Fox is one of the most popular games on the N64, and for good reason too; it brought new ideas to the video gaming board. Sure, Star Fox wasn't the first piloting game, but it was the first piloting game to give the player a 3D perspective of the whole game (Or at least the first one to master it). It may not seem like a huge deal, but Super Mario 64 did the same thing with showing the possibilities of a 3D game, and it was one of the greatest games made. The keyword to this whole situation is ""Master"". For a game to be good, you have to expand and evaluate on the ideas and concepts on a game. To master a game, you have to do that, plus achieve every subconscious way to attract the player. Star Fox did this, and quite well at that. It put its new mechanics to the test, not with gimmicks, but with trivial or optional situations. It found a way to have mini-obstacles in the game for the player to experiment with, like random hoops or enemy formations. It also excelled in the combat system as well. It accomplished great control-ability, and smooth movement which gave the player a feel of complete control, especially with moves like the famous ""Barrel roll"". The main thing that makes Star Fox so great is that it's hard to find anything wrong with the game. Though, there are the cheesy lines and acting, the over-easy levels at times, and the lack of cooperation with teammates, those problems are minor. You have to look at the game as a whole, and look at what appealed to you the most. In Star Fox 64, there is much to appeal to you, and you will most definitely come back to play again (Most likely to find out how to play on those other planets).. Man I really love this game. I played this game all the time when I was a kid, and now looking back on it, Star Fox 64 was better than I ever remembered. And hey who could forget the classic quote ""Do a Barrel Roll!""? But Slippy Toad though has to be the most annoying character in this game. But so with great music wonderful graphics and addicting gameplay, Star Fox 64 is a classic. Score: 4/5.. Star Fox 64 is the best Star Fox game to date. Everything about it, from the awesome graphics to the crazy shooter action, is near perfect. You can't go wrong with this game. The only gripe I have with this game is Peppy the freaking toad. God, he's annoying.. One of the greatest games I've ever played and very close to being the best N64 game of all time. Replayability is practically endless and the game's challenging and varies enough for you to want to keep playing.. Star Fox 64 has great graphics, good controls and i like that there is more than one route to complete the game. The major problem is the difficulty, its way to easy. However its fun.. Star Fox 64 is one of those amazing games that cannot be described in words, as nothing I can say will be adequate enough to describe an amazing thing that can only be experience firsthand. This is a game you simply must try.. Star Fox 64 Graphics 9/10- look amazing, extremely detailed environments and textures for N64 standards. The rumble pack was used for the first time in this game, enhancing the vibrating controller experience. Some points have enemies and texture pop-ups a bit too close to the player. Many items and textures can fit on screen, but this sometimes results in the game taking a slowdown, fortunately this only seems to happen on the non-arwing stages. The laser blasts and bombs are colorful and cartoonish. Sound 8/10- pretty solid, voice acting is corny but well done, sound effects are awesome to hear and correspond with the gameplay perfectly. The music and soundtrack differs in each linear stage and some sandbox stages, giving an atmospheric feel for the level design and situational urgency it has to offer. The boss music is the same throughout the game minus the final boss and Star Wolf's theme, but the track itself is pretty stimulating and appropriate. Gameplay 9/10- addictive, and stimulating, so much is happening on screen at once, enemy variety certainly helps and even though some may be disappointed with the generic cookie-cutter enemies that die with one shot and lack of difficulty. Choosing multiple paths and two different endings give it much replay ability value. Boss fights are fought in either a sandbox or POV fashion. They are generally easy and not too challenging, though there are some exceptions. Minus the sandbox levels, each stage ends with a boss battle. Defeating these bosses under certain conditions can unlock multiple paths to take upon completion, but you arenâ. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great graphics for the game system, and a wonderful story that has had me hooked for years. It has addicting game play that allows you to keep playing the game over and over again. It is the best game of the star fox franchise, the best game on the nintendo 64, and i think the best video game overall.. You will never find a greater game than this. If you plan on getting playing on the Nintendo 64 ever and you haven't played this, you are missing out on one of the greatest 64 games conceived. Memorable characters and lines (Do a barrel roll!), fun combat, and replayibility up the whazoo.. Star Fox might not be the benchmark for flight simulators (and I call it that loosely) and the length may not be the longest, but it is non the less a great game that still can be a lot of fun. Don't expect a legendary game, but don't be surprised if you find yourself getting the urge to play despite the fact it is 15 years old.. A thoroughly original and addictive game with fluid gameplay and a large cast of characters. Fast paced and large scale action make this a game that showed what the N64 was capable of. Maneuvering in all range battles can often be tricky but apart from this there is little that holds the game back.. star fox on the SNES was alot of fun and the N64 version is even better with multiple paths extending the amount of times you can play it along with very nice graphics for its day . the new addition of taking you into free roam combat and fighting the evil star wolf force was alot of fun . if you loved the old star fox you will love the 64 version . now why cant they make a great star fox game like this for the wii?. I was so disappointed by this game that I registered on this site just so that I can warn other people, because this game has yet to receive an honest review. What we have here is a turd wrapped in gold. As a big fan of Starfox for the SNES, as well as Starfox 2 for the SNES, I thought it would be perfectly natural for me to enjoy Starfox 64 for the N64. Ooh how naive I was. This is easily not only the worse Starfox I have ever played, but also the worse N64 shooter that I have played as well. Honestly, I am still in shock over how absolutely awful this game turned out to be. You see, the worse thing about this game is all of the hype and praise that surrounds it. You get the impression that not only is this a fantastic N64 game, but one of the best! At first, it is a very good game. However, once you get into it, you realize how this is a video game that is clearly a victim of genuinely terrible game design. Everything is way too easy at first, it's dead obvious. So how did the game designers fix this? You would be right to think that they simply made it more challenging later on, but sadly this is not true. The route that the designers chose to make this game more challenging was to simply make it cheap, and cheap as hell. That's right, you will not lose due to your own skill, no, if you lose, it will be due to some poor and/or cheap design choice. To top it all off, the final boss is nothing but a giant, detached, floating monkey head with giant, detached, floating hands. I think that pretty well explains the story for this game as well. With the 3DS coming out soon, and a 3DS version announced, I got this game to see what the hype is all about. Please, don't buy into the hype. There is nothing good and/or special to be found here.. I came to play this game late. Never really interested, but it still tried it. I loved it and I am pretty sure I played from start to finish in one sitting... that sounds too insane but I think it's accurate.. Ah yes. Good ol' Lylat Wars. (Or Star Fox 64) Surely one of the greatest games of all time. The gameplay is really fun and it has replay value due to its multiple endings. The graphics are great for an N64 game. The controls are responsive and do a great job to navigate you through its challenging levels. The characters are great and have varied personalities even though Slippy is well, himself. Also, luckily Panther isn't in the game. Very lucky. It does get repetitive though... It's still a classic and I'd give a 9.5 if I could, but I can't. Unfortunately for poor of Fox and crew the later sequels are pretty bad (well, Star Fox Assault...ergh...). Hope they return to their glory days. I've also heard that Platinum Games want to make a Star Fox Game. Hope it works if they do get to it...",star fox 64 is easily one of the best games on the n64 both gameplay wise but also in the way that it fits the n64 so well . the interesting dialogue is memorable and the game itself is very quotable . the game is perfect except for the length .
545.NHL 09,"This is the best NHL game ever since they brought out the new shooting configuration with the right stick has made this game the bomb. Also love the way to be the goalie and customize his pads and how so many goalie companies sponsored this game like vaughn and rbk, so sick. I haven't really played a hockey game since ESPN National hockey night in like 94. I have played arcade style games though. This game really plays well. The mechanics and controls are near perfect. The graphics are pretty good. The game does have some glitches and it lacks the features that a lot of other Ea Sports games have.. This game is good,it really is but here comes the ****'s not nearly as good as espn hockey 2k4 and **** single player there should be a way to tweak the difficulty more.A game should be as easy as you want it or as hard and this game is hard even on easy in the single player mode.I can play hockey and I've went back to all the hockey games from ea and 2k and this game just isn't well **** is exciting,out of this world exciting especially when there has been no score for a while and then bam you **** has to do a lot with the commentary but also the game in ****'s great but ea still has a lot of work to **** 8 is a good score and what the game deserves.",this is the best NHL game ever since they brought out the new shooting configuration with the right stick has made this game the bomb . i haven't really played a hockey game since ESPN National hockey night in like 94 .
546.Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition,"Imagine a lush world full of wonder and magic, where the trees almost glow green with life and the sky is so big and is of so many colors that it looks like the backdrop for some beautiful Victorian painting. That is what I felt when I played this game as a little kid for the first time. Just the ability to experience so many emotions from one piece of art. The levels and areas are all beautifully drawn and take on a life of their own instead of being stiff drawings you walk through to progress. Every time I entered a new location I felt I needed to take some time to appreciate how much work went into the backgrounds when I replayed this game recently (especially the spirit tree, one of my favorite locations in any video game). This, of course, is not to say that the level design is the only good part of this game, as the characters are all illustrated very prettily as well, especially Ori. I love the fluid animation of the character, especially the jumping, wall jumping, and bash mechanics. Naru and Kuro are drawn very well additionally. The game makes Kuro seem a formidable foe during the first couple of acts in the game, and a tragic character by the end. Even though I usually like to see boss battles and whatnot in metroidvanias such as this, the lack of different bosses does not really matter too much when I am so entranced in the story of the game. The story, while somewhat simple, is beautifully told through animation and some mysterious dialogue that paints a picture of misunderstanding and sadness, but also hope by the end. You learn to love these characters without them saying a single word, and I believe that to showcase the game's strength in pulling at your heartstrings. The music has always stayed with me since a child, to the point where when I was listening to a random Jace! regalia song a few days ago it reminded me of the soundtrack of this game. I listen to a lot of the tracks from this game quite a bit on my own time, which is something I can't say I normally do for any game really. But all of these songs (especially Naru, Embracing the Light and Climbing the Ginso Tree) are beautiful and I believe should be way more recognized in terms of video game OSTs. I made this review because this game filled my mind with so much wonder and emotion as a little kid and I hope it can do the same for you. If you love platformers or metroidvanias, please check out this game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ori and the Blind Forest is a perfectly fine game. It's a metroidvania action game with a unique naturalistic art style. The controls feel pretty good and the map is well designed. The game doesn't commit any major sins, but it can feel a bit mediocre at times. The themed dungeons feel well designed and fun to play through and I liked that the parry mechanic can give Ori an extra boost to reach places. Also the escape sequences provide some of the best and most cinematic gameplay moments in my opinion. The art style is probably the game's biggest selling point. The problem with the art style is that it is sometimes hard to see spikes and some enemies and projectiles as they have a tendency to blend into the background or be obscured by the foreground. This coupled with the games manual saving mechanic can lead to some frustrating deaths. The story is just kinda there... I don't know, I was expecting a bit more. I did enjoy my time with Ori and the Blind Forest, but I can't help but feel as though the developers could have taken things a little further.. A very refreshing and original game. The game skills like Bash were great fun and added to the overall newish flavour of the game. The puzzles were never too many and always unique and well done. I found the overall spiritual theme of the storyline a tad overdone.. The music, controls, story, and the complex yet simple structure of this game is just wonderful. The story feels so somber and melancholy while having this playful feeling. Highly recommend for anyone who likes games like Hollow Knight.. Beautiful game but the controls just don’t click with me. They feel way too floaty for my liking.. One of the best and iconic games of the Metroidvania genre. It is simply perfect in terms of art design, storytelling and use of sound and music. Except for the challenging platform elements and a few cancer-inducing gameplay elements, it is the first name that should come to mind when it comes to a perfect side-scroller metroidvania game. The gameplay is not boring and you follow the story with either a smile, an anger or a sadness. YOU MUST PLAY. One of the best platform game. It has amazing story telling, outstanduhg soundtrack and sound effects. I suggest to play it in easy because you need to be swiftly. The game logic is well developed. I suggest you to finish this journey and get ready to play the second Ori game.. This game is beautiful: the gameplay, the graphics, the story and the soundtrack. A wonderful experience. Excellent puzzle platformer. Great story, excellent graphics. You’ll be an unstoppable force about 3/4 of the way through the game and then hang on to your hat cause it’s a blast. Highly recommended. First of all. I am not a 2D guy and I have never played a metroid vania game until now. (Played for the first time in 2023, on series X) This game blew me away. I could hardly put the controller down. Here were my big positives! - Best platforming ever. - By the end of the game the way all your abilities, attacks, and movements options blend together second by second is masterful. - Thrilling set pieces. - Amazing puzzles. - A perfect original score - beautiful graphics and art style. - A touching story told without words. - Fun enemy design. - Good progression system. - fun exploration - perfect level design- many collectibles! - fun leaderboards etc. - Great achievements! This game is a most play, it is perfect!. I feel Ori and the Blind forest is as much a work of art as it is a game. Developed by Moon Studios and published by Microsoft Studios, releasing in 2015 for Windows and Xbox One, and later gracing the Nintendo Switch in 2019 through the further improved Definitive Edition, Ori and the Blind Forest captivated me throughout my first 12 hour playthrough. For an overview, Ori and the blind Forest is a 2D Metroidvania, a genre known for its focus on exploration, item collection, and backtracking to previously unreachable areas. You play as Ori, a delicate white spirit, and guided by Sein, the embodiment of the Forest's Spirit Tree, players embark on a story filled with challenging platforming and surprisingly complex puzzles. The game beautifully balances agility and precision as Ori navigates the lush world, while Sein provides the means to battle foes and shatter obstacles with Spirit Flames.What I find is the most enthralling element is the stunning attention taken towards the artwork that paints the environment of Nibel. Mahler explained, ""You see this tree in the background and this mushroom and this rock? That's the one and only place you'll ever see those assets."" What feels like endless gorgeous artworks paint the environment of the ancient forest world known as Nibel. This pairs with a simple but elegant story, that genuinely brought a tear to my eye as the credits rolled, with the ethereal orchestral soundtrack composed by Gareth Coker, (Halo Infinite, ARK: Survival Evolved). With the definitive edition comes behind the scenes filming of the recording of the soundtracks and seeing the live performances of these pieces really put into perspective the effort that went into making this game. All I can say is no wonder it was nominated for best independent game.This is by far the most satisfying character to control I have experienced. Best played with a controller, platforming with Ori is enough to maintain the enjoyment of the game alone. This is combined with numerous mechanics that all blend into what I feel is the best platformer released for the modern system generation. One standout feature is the ""Soul Links"" save system, which allows players to save their progress at any point, provided they have collected enough energy cells. The scarcity of these cells forces players to be careful with their use, adding an extra layer of depth to the game. Additionally, a simple but effective upgrade system lets players enhance Ori's abilities, making the journey more manageable as they progress. Newly unlocked abilities align with the next unlocked areas such as the ability to jump from forest lanterns. These are also present in the early area of Nibel but can only be accessed at a later time to reward those who retrace their steps. This is further expanded upon in the definitive edition, adding 2 new areas that provide a deeper backstory to the character of Naru, along with 2 more abilities and the inclusion of the spirit wells which give the ability to fast travel between areas. This reduces any slight tedium in backtracking, however it does not make backtracking a fruitless effort for those who wish to not use the wells.Even though my first playthrough took 12 hours, I have spent at least 90 hours replaying, completing it to 100% completion, and attempting the “One Life'' difficulty mode introduced in the definitive edition. For a first playthrough the story is an emotional story of reunion that genuinely brought a tear to my eye. The balance of story to gameplay enables subsequent playthroughs to not be marred by the repetition of the story beats, it certainly does not become **** overall, yes, I feel this game is absolutely unmissable.. Wow, what a game! Beautiful, charming and master crafted in every way. Amongst my favourite games.. Glorified dlc once again from xbox. Why do they keep doing this over and over again.. The game is awsome in design, music, level design and etc. The only reason is not a 10 is because it crashed and I lost a few minuts of gameplay. Series s. I'm not especially big on platformers, but with such fun gameplay and a wholesome heartfelt story, the Ori games are perfect!. Very much enjoyed this game. I’m a very casual gamer. I appreciated that I didn’t get lost and was able to find my way from point a to b with little confusion. Story was a little weak, but I had a lot of fun.. Emotional rollercoaster and amazing gameplay. Loved this one from start to finish.. The story is beautiful ori is one of the must play of this generation 10/10 i recommand. The game is beautiful, the story is nice and kind. And everyone talked about this, that's why I started this game. But comon, some sections, especially escape sequences will just burn your ass because of odd controls and mechanics that work poorly. You don't put a nice physics in a platformer game where you require perfect reaction and precise actions. But the controls don't allow you this opportunity, plus because of physics you just need to replay sections because the thing that you needed to make a jump, for example, is simply swept away but wind or something I bet super meat boy and sekiro but this game flamed my ass completely, so it's a 0 from me. That's a pitty and I'm not sure why they made this amazing game with great narrative and added such ass-cracking difficulty. And not in the whole game, but in some specific places. And it's on normal difficulty, I can't imagine what monsters play this game on hard. Game Design - 10/10 Music - 10/10 Gameplay - 8/10 Hardness settings - varying levels of hardness to choose from (which is good). Puzzles - 10/10 if you like puzzles ( I am not a fan of puzzles at all ). Cons: Linear levels, controls with lack of proper instructions sometimes because of which I was stuck for a long time, a bug that I encountered while playing. Ori and the blind forest definitive edition is a beautifully narrated game that's at the epitome of how a game should look like, how the music in a game should be like. The design people have done more than juat a spectacular job for this game and hands down this game has the best design I ever saw in any game. It's beautiful and you have to experience this game to understand what I mean. Gameplay is around 10-12 hours which is ideal and not too long or not too short. I'm at an age where I can't spend hours and hours gaming so I only pick up games that are around 12 hours in length. The levels are interesting and the addition of new features to Ori after each level makes the game progression interesting in an otherwise linear levels. I have few cons as I mentioned earlier in this review. One of them being sometimes the puzzles are confusing that I had to check youtube to understand what to do. I also encountered a bug where I was moving a block and a laser hit it , the block fell at an angle with the ground and the wall and Ori was stuck in the triangle of the wall, floor and one side of the block and I couldn't move it. So, I had to restart the game. Apart from the abundance of puzzles and a bug that I mentioned, the game is a masterpiece and is a game that everyone should play at the least once in their lifetime. However, the Cons are no comparison to the pros of this game which marvels at game design/game art/music/story telling etc. Amazing game with beautiful visuals, music and challenging gameplay. Took about 10 hours to complete.. What do I have to say about this game that hasn`t been said before, it is simply a masterpiece in every single way. Also includes a lot of challenging achievements wich I aprecciate.. Beautiful world, great music and story. GamePlay is awesome. So many skills. What a game! It is a rare pleasure to have a game bring you on an emotional journey like this. From the very beginning you are drawn in with beautiful artwork, haunting music and a story that is so well told, it doesn’t leave you. Collecting all the powers and finding the secrets in each area is enjoyable and not a chore at all like some games can be. I really enjoyed every part of this game from start to finish.. Not as great as Celeste, but still worthwhile. Pros: * The music is matched perfectly with art direction (especially in cutscenes) * Metroidvania structure is satisfying (that different from Celeste) * Skills are introduced gradually and that gives time to master them. Cons: * On my Series X the game crashed a few times. The most annoying crash was right after the final boss section, so I needed to replay it again. * The art style is beautiful, but not that functional. Countless times I simply wasn't noticing spikes or miscalculated what's grabbable. That was especially annoying during boss sections * Controls could have been tighter. Climbing over a tiny ledge was a pain even after 10 hours with the game. * I got only 81% of achievements. It has quite a few with unreasonable level of game finesse (like a single life walkthrough). A great platformer with beautiful visuals, a touching story, and amazing level design that pairs with some really fun movement-based skills. Probably the best thing about the game is that all of the skills are movement-based. By the game’s end, you feel like a certified ninja, flying around the screen and twirling through every level like a ballet dancer of death, able to pick between four different fun ways to kill every enemy. The visuals are also excellent, something straight out of a Disney fairy tale. And the story has a powerful and surprising ending, another thing that I really enjoyed that sets this apart from other games I’ve played this generation. It is absolutely a memorable and engrossing ride. But there were a few details I didn’t like as much, and that’s why it’s an 8 and not a 10: —Most items in the game have a similar glowy/fuzzy aesthetic, which makes it hard to tell which items are projectiles and which are not when lots of things are blowing up. —There is no way to move the screen, making some jumps blind. That’s stressful in a game with a limited save function. —Speaking of that save function, I thought I would dislike a save mechanic that was limited and consumable, and you know what, I did. I have kids—sometimes I just need to drop the game instantly. Not with Ori. Don’t let the negatives scare you away—it’s a really great game, and one I heartily recommend.. If you have a game pass on xbox be sure to play cause it’s an amazing experience with breathtaking graphics and a great gameplay. Metroidvania part is also good with great exploration, platforming feels satisfying. Great game overall. I just create an account on metacritic to review this game! IS INCREDIBLE... I'm willing to play part two!. One of the best games from the XBOX games roster. Totally loved what it had to offer.. Masterpiece Unique design, platformer with beautiful soundtracks and special effects.. colorful and enjoyable. Ori is the best platform game in Xbox One by far... Set the top in their year, and the game is addictive and a Little complicated. You need to explore every single part of the map to find everything you need, and the progression system is awesome. I recommend this game 100%. Story breathtaking. Gameplay sometimes a bit hard. Quick-travel could be optimized. A platforming masterpiece in the vein of Metroid, but bringing fresh new gameplay ideas to the genre.. Exceptional!!! Does justice to the platform experience with good graphics, gameplay, storyline. Definitely a master piece and kudos to the creators.. One of the best Xbox one exclusives! Graphics 9/10, Audio 10/10, Gameplay 9/10, Loading times 10/10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Art style 10 Gameplay 9.5 Sound 10 History 10 Amazing game, amazing metroidvania. Ori and the Blind Forest is perhaps my favorite game on the Xbox / PC. The beautiful hand drawn graphics, the story, the characters, the game mechanics, the playability all draws you into a the magical world of Ori. Actually this is the only game where immediately after the end credits I started the adventure again. I have played through everything three times as the only game I have ever played. I highly recommend this game - enjoy!. Ori is strictly for hardcore platform players because the game requires razor sharp ability with the controller. A platformer like 'Bloodstained, Ritual of The Night' is a walk in the park compared to this. There are many unforgiving sequences in Ori, and the game culminates with the toughest section of all; getting through the volcano. There is simply a section that I can't pass and after 50 or 60 tries I just gave it up. So, I completed about 94% of the game, but can't complete it, which is why I'm not rating it higher then a six.. Such a good game!!! I really loved it, it had been a long time since I didn't enjoy a game this type. like 10/10 !!. I love this game. It reminds me of hollow knights. It’s a great adventure game that has you coming back for more. This game stole my heart. Touching story, responsive controls, a good dose of difficulty, and above all : those graphics and musics. It may lacks some fighting phases (thinking of Hollow Knight for example) but it fits with the character and the story after all.. Tight well made action platformer (metrodvania) punctuated by too many frustrating escape sequences. If repeating the same escape sequences resulting 25p of your play doesn't sound good, the rest of an otherwise great game may not be worth it. The Best Game that I ever played, without comments. Graphics: 10/10. Art: 10/10. Music/Soundtrack: 10/10. Gameplay: 10/10. Story: 10/10 interface: 10/10 World: 10/10;. First time I saw this game I expected some logic platformer like Limbo or Max the curse of brotherhood but I was horribly wrong. Visuals and sound are really nice and story and characters are interesting but this is all good I can say about it. First thing I had problems with and it lasted for entire game was manual saving. I forgot so many times to create soul link and automatic saves were so rare. It was so frustrating because there are several really hard parts. Next terrible thing was that the when I was upgrading health and damage then enemies were stronger. So I felt so weak entire game. Also spikes damage was increasing. Controls were also bad. I accidentally stomp into spikes so many times. And last thing there is lots of missable achievements which are especially in fast paced places where you don't have a time to looking for secrets and then you can't go back or replay it again.. Great story very intuitive, a sad story that make you cry, and music are perfect to the emotive situation. My favorite game in all of existence (at least until Will of the Wisps comes out to top it). Beautiful, hand-painted visuals, gripping story, and Easy to learn, hard to master game-play, and one of the most beautiful soundtracks I've ever heard. You can even place your own checkpoints wherever you want. Once you get all the upgrades you'll feel like a god, able to move everywhere while barely touching the ground. I can't recommend it highly enough. You will die. A lot. But it's all part of the fun. Again, I can't recommend this highly enough to you. Play for yourself and see.. Ori is an awesome metroidvania game. They level design is superb and the puzzles are difficult. The story was interesting enough but the graphics and art design is where this game shines! I picked it up on sale for $10, I finished it on hard which took me around 10 hours. Playing on hard plan on dieing alot!. Having played games throughout most of my life, it is hard for most games to grab me in a way that hasn't already been done before. After running into the soundtrack while listening to gaming playlist, I had to buy the game immediately and see if the game lived up to the amazing score, and it did not disappoint. The first 15-20 minutes is beautifully done and the game never lets up from there. One of the best Xbox titles in a long time, and a must buy for anyone.. ****. Absolutely wow. What a game. The Xbox One may not have too many huge, worthwhile first-party titles, but damn it all, ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" is one of them! This game has it all: great, fun platforming, absolutely GORGEOUS scenery and visuals, very beautiful music, a great amount of challenge even on the ""Easy"" difficulty, a very sad but beautiful story and very lovable characters (I found myself sympathizing with Ori, a character that doesn't even speak, more than I find myself sympathizing with several characters in mainstream AAA titles), and several sequences that get the heart pounding and even evoke my emotional side! I'll tell you guys this, I don't think I've ever cried over a story in a video game. ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" had me DAMN close. This game is absolutely masterful, and dare I say, it's one of the best 2D platformers I have ever played. If you haven't played this game yet, please, do yourself a favor! Wow, what a game. Moon Studios, congratulations, this game is brilliant. I can't wait for you guys to release ""Ori and the Will of the Wisps."" Final rating: 10 out of 10 ""Fantastic"". Beautiful and in depth gameplay with a very touching and well thought out storyline to back it up. It can be challenging, however, the game never once dives into the ""cheap"" difficulty. All around a very charming game.. Visually beautiful game, but be warned, this is a platformer. I thought that this would be more of a narrative game the way everyone talks about it, so if you don't like platformers, like me, don't bother with this. The controls are just shy of perfect and most of the jumps are too precise for my tastes. It's also one of those games where the abilities you gain as you progress make the game significantly more playable and you're left wondering why you didn't just have all of them from the start. If you like platformers, this is a must. If you don't, avoid it. You'll only be frustrated like I was.. Short review for this game. environment is beautiful but everything inside this so harm. Hard to play in the first time because controlling this should be practice. Lot of ability for choose, hide secret in the game. The story aren't complicated, easy to understand and make me feel good in ending. This is the best platform game and up there with the best games overall that I've ever played. The visuals and soundtrack completely lure you into the world, creating an almost meditative feel to playing it. It challenges the player without ever becoming a controller-flinging-frustration. The simple story is compelling, engaging, and flows with the gameplay perfectly. I hope they continue the franchise!. From the start to finish the game captures you, **** you softly to its world... Flawless and impeccable, the game had too much environment varieties, outstanding gameplay, challenging situations, and if you play in hard settings like me you'll probably enjoy it even more, because the game is asking for you to dare and beat it... The animations, the simple minded plot and yet heart warming, touching and emotional, the length, the graphics, the soundtrack... this game is top notch, few games have managed to reach that standard of perfection since I started played video games back in 89 with Atari. Ori is a masterpiece, a true achievement as a game as it is supposed to be, simply fun, fluid, charismatic, intriguing, full of emotions, and everything else good memories can bring back to an old school gamer, but a great adventure for this new generations of games too. Remaking my Top 3 now: 1 - Ori 2 - Shadow of Mordor 3 - Dark Souls 3. The soundtrack is wonderful. The animation is good. Regrettably, the most important element, the gameplay, is overrated. Traversal is tiresome and monotonous.. Ori and the blind forest is nothing short of a **** presentation is one of the best I've ever seen. The music is well composed and utterly beautiful. The visuals are also mind numbing. This is probably the best looking game ever, because of it's gorgeous art direction. The story, while very simple, does its job. It's touching and heart warming, but also heart braking. The level design is, just like in Metroid and Castlevania, very intricate. There are a lot of secrets to be found throughout its huge map. The gameplay is also the best I've come across to date. The controls are responsive, and platforming requires mastering of Ori's movement and abilities. The game is also surprisingly challenging.. This is a beautiful peace of art that you will fall in love with. Very precise and challenging gameplay, leveldesign in Metroidvania style, and great artdesign from grafics to sound! Ori delivers it all :) One point off because of some nasty glitches.. I've already gave Ori 10/10 and this deserves the score as well it is the same game but with new and awesome features and more things to do, if you haven't picked up this game now is the time to do so!. This game is absolutely smashing. It's unbelievable actually - the sheer amount of imagination and creativity is breathtaking. This game takes aspects from all major platformers of the past while adding tons of new and creative ideas. The story is very emotional with great pacing, the levels are very challenging, the graphics are a sight to behold and the music - unbelievable. 10 out of 10 - no cons at all!. I didn't like the original that much, and a rerelease is as unnecessary as it could get. Cash grab, skip on it. If you still like childish movies and such that provide nothing new and tell generic stories without risking anything or treading new grounds, give it a go.. Really just a copy and paste of all the recent side scrolling platformers, no original content and it leaves the user with a sense of loss compared to other giants in its category.. Masterpiece, this is the way games should be made, highly recommended, everything from visuals, to gameplay, to music, this a is really enjoyable game, you can bind-buy this game with no worries.. A definitive release was not necessarily needed but extremely welcomed. The added content made an already flawless game better. Playing through the game a second time was somehow more fun. I will always highly recommend this game. The best side scrolling game Xbox One currently has to offer. Beautiful graphics, fluid controls and solid game play that almost forces you to finish in one sitting it's so riveting.. Definitive Edition brought me back to the most immersive and beautiful indie game i ever played in this generation . It´s highly mandatory and addictive ( even after finish the game you feel like playing the game again and again ) at least for me. This is a masterpiece made by a hand of an artist !. I didn't think this game could get any better. Wonderful art style, backed by a heart wrenching storyline, beautifully crafted music and tough game controls will challenge gamers of all ages and levels. New content fits in seamlessly and you'd swear it was there from the beginning. For players of the previous edition, the two new abilities are perfect for those final few achievements you've been missing :). In between stunning visuals, a gorgeous soundtrack, an immersing story, and incredibly fun gameplay, it's impossible not to love this masterpiece ****. I don't usually enjoy platforming games, but Ori and the Blind Forest has captivated me for more hours than I'd like to admit. This Definitive Edition also offers enough new content to make the purchase worth it for those who already own the original game (it is also discounted for those users). I've suggested this game to all of my friends, and so far I haven't let a single one of them down.",cnn.com's tom charity has a review of metroidvania: metroidvania . the game's music reminds me of the soundtrack of this game . the story is beautifully told through animation and some mysterious dialogue .
547.Streets of Rage 4: Mr. X Nightmare,"I think the game is only for those who like old school gameplay in every sense. I felt discomfortable that I can't run or dodge attacks, while there are some enemies who can cover half of the screen with their attck. Worthy DLC's. So Recommend to play and play walkthrough with all the added new characthers.. A Fantastic DLC to an amazing game, with new characters, new additions for old characters, and a lot of replayability, its highly recommended for anyone who owns SoR4. This is DLC done RIGHT. It was so cheap that it makes me feel I owe money to the developers, really, 6€ (and even 10% discounted day one!) for such a great amount of new stuff. Three new characters (plus a secret one), with complete animation movesets and all, plus complete alternative unlockable special movements for ALL of the characters in the game, both “HD” and retro characters, plus new palette colors for all of the HD characters. Then we have the Survival game mode, which is where we gain experience to unlock the new skills and stuff. Survival is randomly generated, more or less, but it also offers a fixed, weekly, variation, where the buffs we get, enemies and bosses never change during that week. That’s nice and fun competition, I like it. Of course, to accompany Survival mode, there are tons of new set pieces that serve as arenas for each stage in the new game mode: they added environmental traps, that we can interact with, to our advantage (or demise), they also added several new weapons, some of them are quite fun to use, and among these new set pieces, we have many easter eggs from the original games, including both locations and enemies / bosses. Honestly, this is how DLCs are done, it really adds a lot to an already incredible game. This game is great, if you like beat’em ups, this is the one.. Fantastic add-on to an already amazing game! Must buy! Great music, new weapons, new stages and multiple new modes!. this game me not enjoy it nice for early but in last i was fell boring to play this game i give 2/10. 2 point for early only. This DLC makes a great game even better. * Three new characters with multiple movesets * New moves for all the old characters to allow them also to be customized * A 4th hidden character to go along with the three new characters * A very fun and highly replayable Survival mode * New songs * New weapons and enemies (enemies from previous games) All for just $8, which is kinda silly considering the amount of work just needed for the additional animations for the old and new characters. And then the free update adds in even more stuff: * Excellent training mode, which also has tips and training on how to play the characters that can show people that the combat system is deeper than just mashing the punch button * Palette swaps so multiple of the same character can be used in multiplayer * Mania+ difficulty for people that are into that * Balance changes and other updates/fixes It's a fantastic DLC that just adds to what I already considered the best SoR game. Opinion obviously, but I just enjoy SoR4 more than I remember enjoying the old SoR games I played as a kid on my Sega. Part of it is I'm not really nostalgic for the old school graphics and animations (which I thought were fine back then), I much prefer the smooth hand drawn style of SoR4. It would have been nice if they'd added native support for online 4 player, but that can still be done with Steam Remote Play or Parsec. Before the DLC the game probably wasn't at 10/10 level, but after the DLC, I think it's closer to a 10 than it is to a 9.","three new characters (plus a secret one), with complete animation movesets and all, plus alternative unlockable special movements for ALL of the characters in the game . Survival game mode, which offers a fixed, weekly, variation, where the buffs we get, enemies and bosses never change during that week ."
548.NieR: Automata,"Deep, philosophical and emotional story telling, combined with so many ideas and gameplay mechanics makes Nier: Automata a true and timeless masterpiece. Must play, easily. The PS4 version works fine on PS5. Perfectly smooth 1080p at 60fps. Visuals look a little bit dated, being spoiled by titles like Stellar Blade. This doesn't harm the greatness of this piece of artwork, though.. Art, Its art. It's a Greek tragedy. The story is outlandish and maybe too far symbolic or metaphorical for most but for me and what I got out of it- I shed a couple tears by the ""final"" (or complete) ending. You don't need to play the prequel Replicant to enjoy but it is a 10% better experience story-wise if you do. AS A GAME, it also slaps- Bayonetta/DevilMayCry fans will heavily enjoy this.. Game has a slow start. It really isn't till the credits roll for the second time that the game earn it's score. As for gameplay, it's your typical 3rd person fighting game in vein of Bayonetta or Devil May Cry 3, with a few twists here and there. unfortaintly, there is no Style rating.. A very particular title, which offers an out-of-the-box narrative, fun gameplay and a very beautiful soundtrack. Definitely recommended.. Probably the best game ever. A game with academic value. One of the most important games in history.. Nier Automata isn’t a video game. Nier Automata is an interactive work of art. It’s a heartfelt, intelligent masterpiece that will transcend time, give you joy, make you cry and that will make you think about the meaning of Life, Humanity and Love.. NieR: Automata exhibits all the qualities that make the medium enjoyable in spades. Creative set pieces, well fleshed out world building and a pleasing art direction intertwine with fast paced action and fluctuating gameplay styles to create an experience that you won’t soon forget. Permeating style in an admittedly overcrowded genre, Nier Automata is a modern classic worthy of admiration.. **** game. No autosave and save at all... You have to beginn all the way fro beginning and cant skip the endless video scenes... **** **** game and waste of money, dont buy!. Sometimes you might hear people talking about this games story as the reason it is so great but as somebody who don't cares about stories and had skipped the cutscenes it is still a masterpiece. Artistically and aesthetically this game is masterfully design, it is beautiful just like a fairytale. Then the movement, traversing or platforming is flawless. The fact that this game is a third person action game, a Shoot em up, a side scroller and an it also incorporates arcade mini games all together the way it does is simply genius. But even with all that being said nothing is quite as excellent as the combat, it is fast, responsive, challenging, incredibly well animated, by the end of the game you are kicking so much machine ass in a fashion that is beyond discription. 100% masterpiece, total respect to anyone who don't like it but sorry you are missing the point, maybe try to look a little bit harder for the brilliance next time.. I was led to believe this was an excellent game, but was disappointed. There were some good points, like the general look of the game, switching between 3D and 2.5D, and the background singing. But the enemies I saw mostly seemed based on the dustbin robot from Star Wars, and the combat was very repetitive and boring. It also started to get a bit weird after an hour or so, pointing to a basic lack of creative talent in the writing team.. Nier: Automata is original, unique and has a lot of qualities: - The hack and slash gameplay is fluid and satisfying and some of the boss fights are just epic. Nier: Automata mixes several video game genre, the experience always feels different and refreshing. - Uses the interactivity to tell a story in a way only a video game can do. - Very immersive thanks to the art direction and the soundtrack - Moving, impactful and thought-provoking story with a lot of twists and turns (I keep thinking about the story and its thematics weeks after finishing the game). - Memorable quotes and great voice acting. - Deep and interesting lore. Nier: Automata has a lot of side materials (stage play, anime, concert,...) and it is connected to some of Yoko Taro's previous game. A must play. Tear through the extremely various and well designed 3 enemy types for the entire game as you endlessly smash your buttons in this boring slogfest, experiencing its mediocre story, nonsensical plot, pretentious poorly executed ""genre-mash"" gameplay, and uninteresting characters and villains. Whose idea was it to make sure you need to play the game more than once to experience the full story? You have to play the perspective of the another character, who was practically with you the whole time you first played the game, who by the way has even worse gameplay than the first protagonist. I have no idea why people think this game is even good, or a masterpiece.. A True masterpiece. A game that really understands how to make multiple playthroughs meaningful.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A truly profound experience that redefines storytelling through videogames. It twisting, emotional tale kept me gripped all the way from Ending A to E.. If you haven't played this there is no purpose of your gaming as simple as that. I would agree thiss game is not for everyone, but if you want an intruiging, memorable story and excellent combat this is a must play!. What a Beautiful Game! Its so good! The Charakters, the World and the Musik! Just WOW!. To all those who say this game is overrated: you didn’t get it. Full stop. For me, this is the best game that has been created so far. You don’t have to give it a 10 out of 10, but whoever gives it less than 8, doesn’t understand good gameplay, music, storytelling or grasped a quantum of the underlying message that is being told. This game has done nothing short of raising the medium of videogames to a level above that of other non-interactive media like books or movies. This is a quantum leap in storytelling and the music and gameplay keeping pace with it, rules out considering this game to be below any rating than „exceptional“.. The Begin is so stupid and poorly designed that the person responsible should be fired, there's no excuse for a 30 min without save, non cutscene skip begin. Story very boring, fight can be change in auto mode. I was expecting better from this game. Too Japanese style for me. Music outweighs Gameplay itself. Some interesting designs and innovations in the game, but art & music are what makes NieR truly special.. This game has a bunch of different side quest. This game has different side missions, treasure spots. Enemies to fight won’t give you much exp but later on it will. And there’s also a blacksmith that allows you to forge different items or weapons. And the main story has a lot to offer more then just a simple and happy. This time. It has a dark and twisted storyline and it touches the matter of lost and miscounted slavery and it does dark. Keep the lights open and buy a new happy and house friendly rpg m. But if you can handling the creepy and crawling. Grab a ps5 or 4.Grab a Pepsi. Or a bag of chips. And enjoy the games of the twisted mess up storie. A gaming experience I will never forget but wish I could to play through it for the first time again. Incredible game with a perfect soundtrack.. 10/10 this game androids are more human than us humans. nier automata story, gameplay, bosses and most important character growth is simply amazing. I paid 100 dollars on the game and I dont regret bying the game I even have it on both pc and ps4. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Man I wanted to love this game so badly. Instead I ""only"" liked it. Don't get me wrong the story is really good, but I don't think it's as deep as I wanted it to be. The [E]nding still hits hard, but I don't think it's the ""I need a break from reality"" ending that a lot of people were making it seem to be before I played it. I enjoyed the combat a lot more than I expected, especially since I don't typically play action rpgs. The soundtrack is an absoulte artistic masterpiece, probably in my top 5 OSTs. I understamd the appeal of this game and why people call it a masterpiece. But I just have a different vision of what a masterpiece is. It's definetely a very special game that I still would recommend, but my search for a game with a story (and especially an ending) thats as good as red dead redemtion 2's still remains.. All the side quest are so nice, with funny thing, with surprise, no boring side quest. Not just telling to kill some monster and than get money, is a ture side quest with true side story.. One of the best games I ever played.I've just finished the C ending, and I cried, it's just beautiful and incredible. amazing gameplay with fluid movements, alright story with some plot holes, great voice acting from the english cast, love the main characters' developments. I know this game is legendary to some of you.. but certainly not for me. The gameplay may be fun and i've completed almost 80% of it. But the UI of Nier Automata is some of the worst i've ever seen. Have spent hours wondering what am i supposed to do next, because the map and the markers are just horribly adjusted. When a game forces me to look in the web to know what is my next step - thats indication to me that it's just badly made. I'm not giving it a negative score though, because the gameplay was fun and its pity that i had to rage quit.. played.. Pretty unique in a lot of ways, but definitely super overrated!!!! The open world isnt exciting at all and it has a lot of annoying game design choices (for example the save system).. Best Action JRPG a ever play with XENOGEARS, this is real GHOST IN THE SHELL 3. AMEN. It´s a masterpeace, that´s all. Nice Story, characters, music, lore, everything in this games is outstanding.. A good game, but VERY overrated. While polished and enjoyable, has many flaws. Huge lack of enemy variety, too few bosses, combat is clean but gets repetitive, the story is predictable if you are not under 14yo, and I couldn't care for any of the main characters. A good game overall and better than most of modern games, but as I said, really overrated.. Nier: Automata is comprehensively exceptional. Its structure is easy to understand yet deep enough for players to explore. The storytelling, which discusses the meaning of mankind's existence from the perspective of robots, is refreshing. The game excels in role-playing design, capturing human emotion and spirit within the robotic framework. I must mention the charm and artistry of the character design. Characters like 2B and the others maintain an appearance of emotionlessness, while radiating the essence of mankind's spirit consistently. As for the battle and action design, it leans toward a fast-paced style rather than being hardcore, immersing players in a touching story and an outstanding soundtrack. This narrative encourages contemplation of philosophical concepts like existence and the future, making it a satisfying experience for JRPG fans seeking action and an open-world sensation.. Spoilers ahead. An Age where the Children of Mankind and Extraterrestrials are the next Generation: A.I. vs A.I. When Nier Automata was announced I could not have possibly been more happy. Nier Gestalt is my second favourite game of all time. The setting, the main character, the story - I always wanted a sequel. And it is finally here. I am also a great of the ficitional theme of A.I.s, so not the ones that we as computer scientists make that do not live but the A.I.s that are actually already alive from developing a consciousness. And Nier Automata takes exactly this theme. Drakengard already introduced A.I.s as it already consisted of Androids. Nier Automata takes it to the next level. It puts you into the role of the Androids, this time fighting machines that were brought from outer space. And as we think of it from out ordinary A.I.s, the Androids think of the machines as mere machines without consciousness and emotion. No person, no A.I. Of course this brings some twists with it within the story as Androids obviously are not the only artificial lifeforms that achieved psychological living. At the same time, while appropriate to the Drakengard series it brings several tragic questions with it concerning your side and that of the others. Granted, it is not as good for me as the first one. But I did not expect that anyway. I knew from the very beginning that it would not be the case because Nier Gestalt, so the Western Nier has a father-child story and talks about what you would do for your most precious while giving you the original you were cloned from as antagonist who of course feels exactly like you and at the same time shows that with both sides to be pities people still do not have the right to de-value other lifeforms like clones for example just because they were not born naturally or intended. The story of Nier Automata still brings its own nice side of life and valueing and all with it and the post-apocalyptic setting together with its incredible music, character design and a wonderful combat system from platinum games does the rest. Con: Unfortunately, though I love it as part of the Nier timeline, I cannot just normally enjoy Nier 2 as I did the first one. The decision of making this RPG more action-oriented heavily influenced the overall design of the game. I prefer a more simplistic style like in the first Nier where I can just sit back and enjoy instead of getting constantly frustrated. Example: Nier Automata tells you it has no auto-saves. Well, that is not 100% accurate. Still, while there are some automatic moments where you get set back in case of losing you might find yourself in trouble. In some situations you just cannot save manually and Nier 2 consists of those Gundam air battles. One of them was very long and I ran out of Potions. It should not be a thing that even on Normal difficulty you are stuck in a battle forever because you are allowed to make only very few mistakes. This is the most apparent checkpoint complaint I have but there were a few more moments. Another thing is the hacking: Hacking is a little minigame feature in the game that you just have to go through even when doing the regular storyline. The problem is, this minigame consists of just moving your analogue stick and shooting. You cannot evade anything other than by moving away, you cannot heal, you cannot really do anything in a problematic situation. The mingame consists basically of the thought of ""Learn the pattern for the harder ones"" but that is easier said than done often. You are allowed a few mistakes but sometimes even when already knowing what to expect the maneuvering alone might lead you to the need area where the enemy units that you want to destroy with the hacking shoot at you. There are several hacking instances which are very easy and then some where I think they should just ot have been there because whenever something needs simply too long then it should be re-considered. Hard Modes exist for a reason but why doing such frustrating things on lower difficulties - it just is an obstacle so you cannot fully enjoy and that is something I really think of as a real pity for a sequel of Nier. Finally, the last thing I think that was very risky: The narrative style. Drakengard is always known for a very unusual narrative style both theme-wise as well as how the story is put together. The thing is: In Drakengard you might be used to the story being presented after a few playthroughs but in Nier 1 it was more like you had to go through the same storyline, then go through it again and again with just a few additions ad endings. Here you have the first two endings in the middle of the story, get more to know during run 2 and after run 2 you actually continue with what happens after those endings, so unlock the rest of the game you could say. I am fine with it but I am not sure how many people who are not used to this actually have the nerve to do 2+ runs. Still: I love Nier and recommend it.. I wouldn't say the best story telling amongst all the games outside but it was the one and only game I wanted to achieve platinum trophy on PS4. It weighs heavy on my heart for quite a long time even after clearing it. The only game I wished that has a sequel and thanks Platinum Games for making the combat system.. One of the easiest 10s you can give to a game imo. The brilliant writing of Yoko Taro mixed with Platinum Games combat and an absolute killer soundtrack. There is really nothing this game does bad and it is such a unique gaming experience if you aren't familiar with Yoko Taros other games I'd recommend everyone to pick it up.. NIER: AUTOMATA is a very traditional jrpg in terms of the replay system design, also it tops it off in character design and music which I was always struck by. The slightly lengthy sidelines and an open-world with little exploration elements are some of the game's few flaws.. +The combat is fun +The soundtrack is great -Too long with too many endings -The map is awkward with ugly environments -Invisible walls -Same type of enemies -Some parts are annoying and tedious. Loading time takes too long, but other than that, i loved every single bit of this game.. Both the story and gameplay of NieR:Automata repeatedly change your perspective, but the gameplay is boring and the more ambitious choices feel inconvenient and pretentious.. Fantastic story, adorable characters, wonderful music, and well-designed battles. The only thing that could be improved is the graphics.. I did 100% twice with pride. This game is just a masterpiece for those who like action RPG.. 9.4/10 What is the best PS4 game? Bloodborne, The Witcher 3, Persona 5, Red Dead Redemption 2, Rocket League, 13 Sentinels, Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry 5, God of War, Uncharted 4? Nope it’s none of these, it is Nier: Automata, and it isn’t even that hard of a choice. Nier: Automata achieves what many games should be trying to achieve – A perfect marriage of gameplay, visuals, story and sound. You should go into this knowing as little as possible so I’ll keep things brief. The story is one of the best ever. It is phenomenal and so effective. It’s the type of story that can only be done properly in video games. The soundtrack is one of the best ever. The game doesn’t have the biggest budget visuals but the art direction more than makes up for it. The game play is great and is a mix of action RPG and hack n slash with other ideas added in. It’s made by Platinum Games, the developers of Bayonetta, Vanquish and Astral Chain. So why am I not giving this a high 9? Unfortunately due to the way the game plays and how the story is told there is too much repetition. You fight the same enemies and see the same locations often. Then on top of this the side quests can be bland and add to the repetition. But of course all of this is really nothing compared to how good this game is. Are video games art? Yes, Nier: Automata proves this. Are video games on the same level as great literature and films? Yes, Nier: Automata proves this. If Roger Ebert was still with us Nier: Automata could have changed his mind on video games. Nier: Automata has the power to change you or at the very least be thought provoking and moving. Yoko Taro, the games writer and director, is a genius. Yeah I know this review sounds hyperbolic but Nier: Automata deserves it and if this little review convinces one person to play Nier: Automata then it has been more than worth it. If you love this medium then you need to play this. 9.4/10. well, this game turned out to be my favorite of all time, yoko taro is a genious and i cant recommend this game enogh, the all the 4 ports of the game (PS4, Nintendo switch, xbox and pc) work great so you can play it anywhere. When beating the game is just the beginning. Incredible how an apparently flat character like B2 can excite so much. Ending E just fits it all together and leaves you with undescribable emotions of hope and sadness at the same time. Gameplay is awsome. Introduction: i have heard a lot of praise about the game, so i decided to try it. i ended up having a lot of highs and lows. good things: special effects, animations, character models, combat. The music is as good as they say. weapon variety and uniqueness + chip system. what could have been improved: make vehicles available or make fast travel available earlier. especially for the 2nd play-through. The game crashed 6 times on Ps5 for me - something which happens often if i am to believe the reddit posts on the matter. After 30 hours already, i unfortunately couldn't keep going, when i could be playing other games with no big bug issues like this. also. many buildings look ugly and empty. issues: the story is interesting but so confusing. you also have to replay the game twice which was incredibly tedious and annoying. also no invincibility while hitting and the pod's lock on was usually not on the enemy i wanted. the map and mini maps are horrible. the map is annoying to control/move, and it was soo clustered and full of huge red circles and red diamonds and red dots, even more so if you accepted side missions, so i stopped accepting side quests. losing chips when you die. in dark souls, you lose the souls you collected, but not your weapons or core stats/skills, meaning that you can come back and still fight like before to try and retrieve lost souls, but here, you come back weaker, more vulnerable, and not knowing what to expect - not fun. Conclusion: major issues on ps5 made it crash often, the 2nd most after cyberpunk2077 in my experience. the story structure is confusing and unsatisfying to go through, despite interesting themes /tones/ideas. The storytelling should have been clearer, just like the map. The music and Japanese VA are a strong point. 2B and 9S look fantastic, but the surroundings not as much. the combat is good but i see room for improvement (improving lock-on, adding invincibility on attack or parrying, keeping chips when dying). it is nonetheless memorable, fun, and unique overall. 85/100. Pros - my personal favorite story videogames ever produced - my personal favorite piece of music videogames ever produced surrounded by one of the greatest soundtracks that perfectly compliments any scene you happen to be in - flashy and fluid combat, courtesy of the masters at Platinum Games, with different enough variation between the playable characters - hauntingly beautiful conclusion, that is one of a kind all of gaming Cons - route B is a repeat of route A from a different perspective and does not offer enough variation for me to be completely ok with it (though I still find it fantastic) Nier Automata is my favorite game of all time. With that comes a heavy amount of bias from but I genuinely believe that this is gaming's finest art piece that manages to be fun. Nier is a slow burn of a story that grips you and leaves you empty and unsure of what to do with yourself after you have experienced it. To get the cons out of the way, route B aka the second playthrough of the game is a repeat of the entire route A with slight variations to keep it interesting. There is no avoiding the fact that you are going to be retreading the same main story points through the same areas and hearing the same dialog. The added perspective of the second character you are playing is what saves that for me and I still ended up loving it even though I understand that there are a lot of people that will be discouraged by this, which is fine. The Drakengard/Nier franchise was always unafraid to be weird and depressing, but I feel like it always served to its benefit. Automata is no different in this regard. The story is beautifully tragic leading to standout character moments that allow for the cast to shine in their unique ways. These fantastic moments are then accompanied by some of the most perfectly fitting music ever made. There is never a moment where the soundtrack dips in quality or breaks a scene. The fact that Rays of Light, a song playing throughout the central area of the game, never gets annoying is a testimony to the simple beauty of this OST. And then comes the ending. Nier pulls off a miracle with its ending, rarely seen in the media. There are 1000 ways to do what Automata did with its ending and 999 of them are stupid, cringeworthy and come the f on. Automata somehow manages to pull out the 1 way where it lands its themes so spectacularly that I consider this the best ending in games, movies and books. I adore Automata and encourage anybody who is interested in this 2017 masterpiece to give it a try. You will be doing yourself a favor by playing it.. Best game I've ever played. Has the best soundtrack and story I've ever seen in a game. Combat is fantastic as well.. Fantastic video game! Super fun as exciting and, above all, fascinating. Kudos to the developers for hunting this pearl in an increasingly barren market. Well done! P.S. it works great. this is the best game ever made its story is amazing ,the characters compelling, and the lore interesting but the thing that did it for me was a cross of 2 things the beautiful art and music and ****. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Yeah I have no real complaints with it. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful even though most of it is in a made up language. The gameplay is fun, the characters are great, the story is great (never beat all of them, but knowing they're there is awesome). Plus 2B is waifu, what's not to love. But fr this game is something special.. A masterpiece. One of the best games I have ever played. I not only enjoyed the amazing music, characters, world, and story but also I have learned a lot from this game. It has changed my life.. Bland and blinding action at too high speeds. The camera is shaky at best and gets locked when you really want to have it free. The music doesn't fix the context with the vocals totally out of place. In ""easy"" mode the game is no longer a game - it becomes a cringeworthy slow bad movie. It is obviously made with fanservice in mind, so much so that it becomes ridiculous and disgusting. After x hours into the game I have no feelings at all to any of the characters. Better pick up any other game in the genre.. I finished this game in 2017 and today six years later, I still haven't found a game like it that made me feel the same way towards a game. Nier will always have a special place in my heart. Not to mention it has a great story, music, and gameplay. I highly recommend everyone to play it, also a piece of advice once you finish the game make sure to click on continue from the main menu since you'll get to play from the perspective of others characters in the game.. Got a little desapointed about this game, it tryed so hard to be emotional and stuff, but didn't work for me.. Games are rarely philosophical like this. And even more rarely do they successfully deal with these themes and tie them into an interesting story. That's what Nier does better than any other game. Its a decent example of games as an artform, although I'd argue that it falls short of other examples such as Dark Souls and Shadow of the Colossus. Other than that, I loved the music, and enjoyed the variety of different gameplay. But overall, despite the variation of different gameplay, it overstays its welcome and becomes really dull. Level design and the main type of combat are pretty uninspired. Its very tedious. 1 point off for the oversexualization of the main characters too. Its just JRPG cringe.. Nier Automata is a fantastic action RPG with heart touching story and narratives from perspective of different characters . Gameplay is really good and combat is smooth and it delivers what it wants to deliver. My only issue with this game is that you have to grind a bit to fight a secret boss(not related to main story that much and the grind is not as bad as say MHW) and some areas like amusement park are a bit small or areas like the desert could have more in it. That's why I deducted 1 point Otherwise main and side quests (even fetch quests are well executed in the norms of it's gameplay). 10 - Masterpiece 9 - Amazing 8 - Great 7 - Good 6 - Okay 5 - Mediocre 4 - Bad 3 - Awful 2 - Painful 1 - Unbearable. Easily in my top 3 best games of all time. NieR: Automata has an interesting and deep story that will stay with you for sure even months after you finish playing. The gameplay and combat system are amazing and the fights feel great and satisfying. The OST is astounding and I hear it a lot daily. Just do yourself a favor and go immediately to buy this game.. Maybe its the protagonist's haircut, but this game made me think of Parasite Eve for PS1, if only in the sense that I liked the setting and concepts quite a bit, but found the actual gameplay to be a bit hard to really get satisfied with. Still, given the captivating anime sci-fi style adventure, I played on and beat it, although I eventually just switched on the auto aim function on the pod because I just wasn't invested enough in the actual gameplay to get better at playing the game without it. Still, the game is its own beautiful thing, so I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a change of pace in an action RPG.. Its a masterpiece Not much word to be said, even wneh the graphic is mediocre, the story and overall, is one of the best so far. 54/100 Automata aims to explore the human condition through inhuman characters, tackling themes of identity and existentialism, but it fails at it, completely lacking the nuance to do it in a compelling way, with heavy-handed dialogue and simplistic, basic characters. Even with such flawed writing, the plot itself manages to surprise and entertain thanks to a great art direction, coupled with a beautifully melancholic soundtrack and a couple of captivating segments that take full advantage of videogames' systems and interactivity as an artistic medium to enhance the player's involvement in the narrative, even more than its predecessor did. Also like the original Nier, Automata frequently shifts its camera perspective, going from third-person to top-down, from side-scroller to isometric, giving each area a distinct exploration flare with varied battle scenarios. This framing variety accompanies combat's multifaceted structure, since the captivating blend of Action RPG and Bullet-Hell is also back. The combat system is greatly entertaining thanks to a nice weapon variety and fluid combos, while the Bullet-Hell element is now even more relevant but greatly suffers from severely repetitive battle scenarios. Physical combat has a similiar problem due to a shortage of meaningful variables unlocked throughout the experience and an extremely poor enemy variety, but the game partially makes up for it with great boss fights and a pleasantly extensive equipment system allowing players to strategically organize inventory space to add various active and passive abilities, suiting different playstyles and customizing progression.. This game is a masterpiece. Yoko Taro x Platinum Games is a match made in heaven. The combat is incredible, the story, the themes, all amazing. I really can't think about one bad thing to say about this game. I loved it.. One of best games i played this game made for people how like to see a deep message in the story. Prologue took around 5-6 hours. One of the worst games I played. No save option in the beginning of the game so you have to replay prologue for several times until you master combat even on easy mode.. Best game I have ever played. The sound track, delivery of the story, combat everything is very unique. It's not like other tipical video game. It's more of a video game or I say this is what video games are should be not lik","visuals look a little bit dated, being spoiled by titles like Stellar Blade . the game is a 10% better experience story-wise if you do . a very particular title, which offers an out-of-the-box narrative, fun gameplay and a very beautiful soundtrack ."
549.Meteos,"Deep, fun, incredibly addictive, and perfect in short bursts, Meteos is about as good as handheld games get. Multiple difficulty settings, an engrossing multiplayer experience, and plenty of depth ensure this one won't be wearing out its welcome anytime soon.. The originality is a key factor to what makes it so great. Meteos is the killer app for the DS.. I freaking love meteos it is the best puzzle game, and I want to create it in real life aaahaahahahahahahah. Finished this game probably a million times now. Weird as hell, but as fun as it can get. I think the core elements for me to like it that much are the gameplay, that can be either very relaxing and fun or engaging and super intense, depending on the difficulty you choose and the weird vibe the game have. The artstyle, graphics and adaptive soundtrack... The entire game feels so alien lol! And that's exactly what the game is about: Aliens battle for survival. This game is a must play on the DS, it's a very creative spin on the puzzle genre.. Refreshingly different, packed full of options and technically polished in every area. Along with ""Advance Wars,"" it’s a must own title for all DS owners.. Find three friends to play with (you can play a limited four-player game with one cart), and you'll never want to put your DS down again.. The addictive gameplay is good enough to play for a quick five-minute round or a gaming session that can last for hours. Once the player becomes adjusted to using the stylus, the addictive qualities will shine through, especially when there are so many things to unlock.. Perfect for a hand-held, Meteos provides an engaging challenge even during brief sessions.. The surprise that Meteos brings is the satisfaction of its physics. There’s real weight in the way an underpowered meteor chunk sinks down to earth, and a sense of dynamic propulsion as you flick together a cluster of gravity-defying rockets. [May 2005, p.91]. How can one make a game based around falling blocks and not have it feel like Tetris? Simple: have the player manoeuvre blocks after they've fallen rather than steering them while they're airborne. In doing so, Meteos becomes one of the best puzzle games I've played, forging a much faster, more physics-based style of play that doesn't feel like it could work without the DS. (Also, as a sidenote: anyone complaining about using the ""scribble"" technique to cheat has obviously not played the game enough. At anything beyond an intermediate difficulty level, the game is far too fast and punishing for that method to consistently help a player.). This is a great game. I cannot stress this enough. It has great multiplayer (ds download play) and awesome gameplay. On a scale of one to ten... I would give this game an 11. It is just fantastic. In my opinion, this game is worth much more than its price.. A true baby from Tetris ""him""self, Meteos introduces a unique, but addicting puzzle game. I love the many different planets and the changing mechanics for each of them, which offers variety to the simple puzzle game. If I had to offer one setback for this game, it would be to stick with a stylus, because you WILL break your screen when you become addicted to it. But all jokes aside, i would bring this game for the road and my hour long trips to enjoy.. Don't get me wrong, I'm no hater of this game, it can be quite fun, but how this got a higher Metascore than thee likes of The World Ends With You, Castlevania, New Super Mario Bros and the rest is completely beyond me. There's just nothing 'Amazing' about the game. Through and through it's ok - good for the most part, but, it's a simple puzzler, that might last you a couple of hours tops. The aim is to slide these blocks around on the lower screen to send them hurtling onto the Top-Screen into a planet. But whilst you can try to be strategic, it's so excrutiatingly hard that in a short while you will be swiping at the screen randomly as soon enough the frustration gets to you as the blocks pile up and you lose control. The problem with Meteos is, that in a good puzzler, you wouldn't be able to complete the game within half an hour by swiping at the screen, but with Meteos, this is the only option if you don't want to throw your DS down with anger from seeing those stupid blocks pile up!!! In the end, Meteos is a solid concept and fun for a couple of hours, and it's definitely worth buying at it's current price, but it should be nowhere near this high in the DS charts. 70 possibly? Yes it's well deserving of that. 80? You could stretch there but your being generous. Almost 90? Pfftt, you really are on a different planet. In summary, Meteos is worth it's price tag, but don't expect it to be what the reviews make it out to be.","the addictive gameplay is good enough to play for a quick five-minute round or a gaming session that can last for hours . perfect for a hand-held, Meteos provides an engaging challenge even during brief sessions ."
55.Astro Bot,"One of the best platformers on the market. Always fun and engaging with cool abilities and every level is different. Astro bot is pure fun. There's no other way to put it. In it's 20h of playtime there was never even a second that I didn't enjoy. Lemme get the weak points out of the way first: The enemies look kind of crappy and one of the 4 unlockable buildings is just a scenery to take photos in, that you visit once and then ignore forever. Now to the strengths. The moveset is simple, yet together with the power ups it's enough to make movement fun. Every world offers something new. They all have different themes, focus on different power ups, some are more open hubs, others are classic linear levels. There are also shorter challenge levels and combat focused stages. This game has tons of unique bosses considering it's short length. So much for gameplay. However, the biggest reason why this game is so much fun is the details and use of the controller. There is tons to discover in this game. The worlds are beautifully built and everything can be interacted with. Every object makes a different sound when hit and creates a different vibration. There are various particles and little objects that move realistically. There are many situations in which you get to have a bit of fun with motion controls, such as whenever you collect a bot. The game then shows you the bot sitting in your controller's Touchpad and you can shake them, throw them into the air, trap them inside, all while feeling them move around in your controller. After you rescued them they move to the hub world. And every one of the many special bots referencing other popular games has a unique idle animation and a unique interaction when you hit it. Add to that an amazing soundtrack andthe fun never stops, because everywhere you go, everything you do, is rewarded. Nothing is boring or repetitive, but rather creative and handcrafted. No filler, no bloat. A true masterpiece.. The content is what shines here. Sony did a great job at building an experience that takes you through many popular games. There are plenty of levels and hours of gameplay. The game is cute and easy to play. The rough parts however are not easily overlooked. For starters, my biggest gripe is the terrible camera. 3D platformers have been plagued by camera issues since the beginning, and Astro Bot is no different. The camera often shifts and turns mid jump or movement causing your character, who was originally on a straight path, to deviate and turn. This becomes very annoying quickly on a platformer that requires precision movement. The game also has visual lag. The hit detection is 1 second ahead of what you see. You will often take damage from obstacles you can not avoid or never come in to contact with. Input lag is also an issue in some areas. Levels with portals were also one of my gripes in that you can not simply find the portal and move on, you had to take it. Meaning you had to then come back to the level and repeat it to get credit. Overall, this game is very cute and brought back many memories from PS1 forward. It incorporated and paid respect to many large titles throughout the gameplay as a head nod to video game history. Plagued by a few issues, the camera being the biggest, this game comes in at about a 7. Fun to play, but far from the ""The best Platformer of All Time"" title. Good job Sony, however after beating this game, I am not really looking for a sequel or to replay it anytime soon.. horrible **** game. No one deserves to be blinded by playing this ass game. I hate this **** stupid **** game. This is a very interesting and ""pure"" game, and it can even be said to be the most fun game from PlayStation's first-party studios in recent years. However, saying that it deserves the Game of the Year award at The Game Awards (TGA) this year might be overpraising it. The game is indeed very fun, but isn't Astro Bot just playing with what Nintendo has left behind? I see a lot of shadows of Nintendo games in this one. Overall, I think this game is not as good as Mario. My evaluation of it is that it's a high-end version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land.Nevertheless, I am still very happy to see Sony release a game so focused on gameplay for PlayStation's 30th anniversary. I hope Sony continues this trend in the future and doesn't release games like Concord anymore.. Fast, fun, smart, cheeeful and glitterind, a true wonder of a platformer, effortlessly reaching the heights of its obvious inspirations, yeah, the ones with a red cap andblue plumber trousers.. Astro Bot is a game that I was sold on the moment I saw the promotional material—it looked like a charming 3D platformer that’s fun, creative, unique, and full of charm and whimsy. When I finally got around to playing the game, I’m happy to say that it even exceeded my expectations. It was easily my favorite game of 2024, and I’m so happy that it won Game of the Year. Those who were mad about it winning didn’t even play the game and need to grow the hell up, you shouldn’t even take the Game Awards that seriously. But please, triple A studios, more games like this, we are starved of high-budget 3D platformers, and not just 100+ hour, hyper realistic, uninspired interactive movies. More games that put being pure fun over everything else.. one of the best games on PS5. i hope it receive more Updates. collecting bots is so satisfying. using of the dualsens is amazing and so realistic. sound design is also magnificent.. I truly love this game. The graphics and gameplay are top-notch and I was smiling the whole time playing. It generates a lot of nostalgia with all the bots you have to save throughout the game. This is a must own game for anyone with a PlayStation 5.. I think that we have to be realistic, it is a good game with good humour and it is funny. But always we have a but, in my case I cannot put more than a seven as it is a good copy of Mario (and Mario Odyssey for me it is a 8-9) and in this game there are a big issue related to collision mechanics, you die even if no one touch you. As well the camara is auto, you cannot deactivate it to do it manually and this is very frustrating when you die because the camera is moving to a position were you cannot see well the perspective. They should correct those issues and would be closer to Mario.... Saying that game is a GOTY and 10/10 is like saying Cheeseburger from McDonald's is the best thing you ever ate because you don't know any better. Bro you have to try some other things first. Astrobot is a fun game, but borrows HEAVILY from 3D Mario games, and from Astrobot Rescue Mission. If you played the VR game you played 70% of this game. Even the tunes are the same. On top of that game is quite short and lacks depth. But all in all, it's solid, if overhyped.. A wonderful platformer. Good enough plot, amazing songs, extremely fun gameplay, and a wonderful addition of cameos that leaves you thinking ""Will my fav PlayStation character appear now??"". The gatchas are worth it, the animations for the bots are wonderful. I agree that it deserves GOTY. People have been **** on it just because it's a Sony game in 2024, a year where Sony is hated, and because it's ""for kids"" and a platformer, when they didn't even play this game.. Astro Bot is a blast to play, with banger music, great plot, a lot of Playstation nostalgia and the level and boss design was well polished. Sony needs to make more games like this, no wonder why it won Game Of The Year. Thank you so much Team Asobi, (keep it up!!:). The level design is insanely creative, and the way it uses VR to immerse you in the world is pretty neat. Every stage feels packed with charm, and Astro himself is just the cutest little robot ever. The gameplay is super polished, with tight controls and tons of fun mechanics. Easily one of the best VR experiences atm.. What a lovely game! Lots of fun that is perfect to play with the family, Lots of nostalgia, I had a smile on my face the whole time. The music is great too.. Perfect, the best new game I've played in years Graphics are lovely Levels are challenging but fair Characters and environments are thoroughly entertaining After Astros Playroom was so good I had high expectations for this game and it has exceeded them all. It's truly a shame that Astro Bot won Game of the Year, because it is just not in that weight class. It's fun. Great graphics. Cleverly designed. But it just doesn't do much that Mario Odyssey did eight years ago. If critics could keep their **** in their pants, and call this what it is -- a fun way to pass the time, the video game equivalent of playing with action figures --then it would have been fine. But to hail this as a masterpiece is absolutely insane. This is Playstation's version of Mario. Full stop. Nothing less, but not much more. Winning GotY has simply set this game up to fail to live up to anyone's expectations.. This is what video games should be most of the time: a fun, rich, thoughtful experience that rewards players for their curiosity and endeavours. Blame it on the poor lineup of the PS5 at launch (some might cheekily say it is still poor today), but Astro's Playroom was already one of the best games on the platform, an authentic love letter to PlayStation. This instalment is no different: it goes slightly beyond the PlayStation realm alone, and offers cameos from beloved video game characters. Its ""gatcha"" mechanic to gather puzzle pieces and therefore collectibles never feel tacky or forced. The whole game is a flawless ride of fun and smiles, accessible to the young, the old and all gamers at heart, not without its challenges (last few challenges are interestingly hard, obviously not unfeasible). Game design is incredibly solid, maybe not as revolutionary as some unanimous gems in gaming history, but with many good ideas and interesting choices. Sound is absolutely amazing, the soundtrack once more is on point. Graphically, it's a stunning game, and the art direction is superb. Finally, I would simply say that I felt the sheer joy I would feel years ago, when still a child, discovering this virtual adventure, and that has become a rarity these days, at least in my humble opinion.. Athough it's a great game, I still don't understand why it won the GOTY. Astrobot is a game with amazing graphics, excellent gameplay, and the feeling that the controls give you is impressive and realistic. The references to Playstation fans are very good, even more if you are one of them. Despite all this sometimes I felt a little repetitive.. best game of 2024 very fun but but there one thing that make me angry and why its 9 and not 10 ......they made the coin text horrible from astros playroom like why the font was sooo good and they made it slanted and short i hope they redo it back to the playroom text font. It's the best 3D platformer since Mario Galaxy and I think this says enough.. It's a really good platformer in an age where platformers are not as prominent as they once were. I can only really describe it as a lot of fun. The music is great, the graphics look fantastic and the controls are responsive. It however does have it's flaws that stop it being a 10/10. The game is pretty much a clone of Super Mario galaxy, not just in plot setting but in gameplay. The moveset is almost identical. It also only gets difficult on a few occasions. The closest comparison I can make is to the PS2 Sly cooper games. Finally the levels are short most are completable within 15 minutes, so this would have been better suited to the steam deck or the switch due to it's pick up and play style.. Goat. 97/100. I'm not a platforming fan, but everything about this game is so awesome. Cool gimmicks, great music, cute protagonist, really makes you wanna root for him and succeed. Awesome balance between fun and difficult with some challenge stages brutal but not impossible. Great fun game, that's just fun for lack of better word. Superb and immersive controls and beautiful world to play in.. An exhilarating rollercoaster ride. Absolutely unmissable fun for all ages! Have tried multiple times to get into gaming. Astrobot finally did it for me!. This game was an absolute JOY to play. Platformers aren’t usually my thing but this game was just so clever and engaging it constantly surprised me. Truly deserved to win GOTY 2024. This is a great game and one of the best platformers I've played it felt like mario galaxy 3 but made by playstation,( that's a good thing) and the ost is incredible I loved that the power ups had levels based around them and the references were so fun. I love playing Mario but Astro Bot is really much better, either on the graphics, gameplay and the motion feedback on the controller. Everything in the world is beautifully crafted.. GOAT game. Many different unique locations, game mechanics, but personally I don't enjoy constantly worrying that I missed a bot at the level that I was supposed to save. Solid platformer, took me back 26 years to playing crash bandicoot on my cousins PS1. Has challenging levels and areas for the experienced platformer and levels filled with wonder and creativity for younger gamers. Really enjoyable platnium. Team Asobi becoming an MVP of the generation.. Beautiful visuals, catchy soundtrack and genius level desig makes Astrobot a true 10/10 and a delicious 3D platformer that you'll keep going back to.. Best 3-D platformer I’ve played in years and for those like me who have been with PlayStation since the early days, it gives you the double dose of being good and hitting the nostalgia of betters year long gone.. First the background story: I've been a Nintendo boy for ages, from a young kid to a middle-aged man. I didn't know much about Astro Bot when my sister called and asked what I wanted for a Christmas present. I told her that maybe Astro Bot could be fun and I'd heard it got good reviews. This was about two weeks before The Game Awards. Then I watched The Game Awards show and saw all the prizes Astro Bot won, which raised my expectations sky-high. I was like a little boy again, who can't wait to open his Christmas presents. And to the game: Astro Bot exceeded all my expectations right from the beginning. It was fun, it was cute, it sounded good and had memorable songs, it was neither too hard nor too easy, it melted my heart and brought light and joy to these dark times. I really enjoyed every moment with the game. There aren't many 10/10 games for my taste, but this is absolutely one of them.. I really really enjoyed this game. Being a PS5, I always miss the Nintendo platformers. But this game filled that gap in my gamer needs, and more. I enjoyed every level, every hidden section. Same levels could be way to easy, but them others were very challenging and at times frustrating (in the manner of the amount of tries it took me to beat it). A true ""Game of the Year"" for me.. Game is simple pleasant. I finished it in about 9 hours. It perfectly shows the capabilities of the PS5 controller and quite good console capabilities. Music is brain hurting, it's seems that one track will play over and over in a loop on lvl and it's not pleasant. Game is more for the younger part of the players, but if you need something not complicated and thought-provoking it's perfect for the evening. TBH this game doesn't deserve GOTY. This game is so good, so so good. It really does put a smile on your face. The only game that I can play even if I don't feel like playing games.. Well deserved GOTY, creative design, fun experience, perfect music,. The controller reaction is very statisfying, i enjoyed everymoment playing this game. The difficulty is very well balanced, i'm not an experienced platformer game player but still can beat all levels with out spending too much time.. Well deserved game of the year. Very creative but yet classic Jump and Run game which will make you smile.. Well done absolutely. The game is the best platformer on the PS5 hands down!. This game improves on everything the PS5 demo offered. It's incredibly fun, with a variety of different powers to unlock. I had a blast playing it, even though I got frustrated in some stages. Still, I’ll keep playing it little by little and leave it installed to enjoy whenever I feel like ****’s a true fanservice for PlayStation owners. As someone who has been a fan of the brand since childhood, I felt a huge wave of nostalgia while playing this game. There were many moments when my eyes lit up with excitement.Simply amazing!. While it feels weird giving this game a perfect rating there is nothing wrong with this game. From the audio design to level design. The gameplay and bosses are all great. This is the first game to make me truly feel like a kid again while playing making it truly the greatest game of all time. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best 3d platformers ever made - had me smiling and loving the nostalgia. There’s enough variety in levels and worlds to keep things fresh. Too often I play games that seem to wain at the end almost as if the steam ran out. But this kept giving right to the end and even after with the dlcs. I’m still humming the music of crash site in my head and is likely for some time. 100% recommend.. This Game Just Brings A Smile (At Least 99% Of The Time) Even Though The Game Is 60$ I Say Go For It Cause This Is A Hell **** 3D Level Platforming The Music And Everything Is Just Perfect. This Game Takes About 10-12 Hours To Beat And That Just The Main Story There's Still Collectables Achievements And More! But My Favorite Part Is The References To Other Games! I Mean I Can See Leon (From Resident Evil) Sitting Next To Ratchet (From Racthet And Clank) This Is A Game For Everyone. Me As A Teenager Loves It My Little Brother Loves It And My Dad Loves It! Ok Thats Enough Yapping Just Buy The Game This Is One Of The Best Games I Ever Played. Astro Bot is the right goty 2024. It is beautiful, fun to play and a family game.. From gamers, for gamers :) perfect game time, full of great mechanics, not borring at any point.. Astro Bot is a truly great game. It is fun, so fun. It reminded me of why I fell in love with the media in the first place.. 3D platforming is back! This is a basically perfect video game that brings me hope that the genre will return in full!. 10/10 This Game is the most fun I’ve had in any Single Player Game. The mechanics/graphics/gameplay/attention to detail create the most fun experience you’ll have. It’s polished, it’s detailed oriented and most important, it’s fun fun fun!. It is one of the best games on PlayStation, everyone should try it! In the main levels, the game is very easy but the side levels make up for this aspect. Best game of 2024 as I certainly think it is creative as I think it adds a lot of refreshen adventures and exciting gems.. This filled the gap that not having a 3D Mario platformer since Super Mario Odyssey has left in my heart.. For pure fun and enjoyment this is the best game on PS5. It is beautifully animated, uses all the features of the Dual Sense, is great for all ages and is not bogged down with an overly produced story. Just lots of nice nostalgic nods to PlayStation's 30 year history and fun platforming and puzzles that gives Mario a run for his money.. Just 100% the game and it was 80% fun and 20% not fun. Love the themes and attention to detail. However, some of the mechanics and controls can be very clunky. Which can become a real problem as a platformer. The monkey hands and the time freeze were some of the most unpleasant video game mechanics I have come across. Overall, it was definitely one the best platformers that have come out in a while. However, its still a platformer and can only offer the threshold of ""Interesting"" that being a platformer entails. This deserved best adventure game but far from game of the year. How out of touch have video game journalist become?. Feels like a true form of a video game. It's simply just pure fun, through and through. absolutely incredible play experience, of course it's my game of the year, some may say this game is for kids, than don't play Mario then.. This has to be one of the best platformer games I have ever played in a long while. The attention to details is absolutely incredible. I don’t think I have ever played a game so simple yet so rich that every mechanic made me go “WOW THAT’S SO COOL!” Also the fact that this game is a hybrid of linear levels and open levels is astounding. I know that some people say this game can be finished in 20 hours or so but since I am just a chill guy and I take in all the little details with time, it will probably hit somewhere between 28 to 30 hours to finish the game. I can confidently say that Astro Bot deserved GOTY. My only complaint is that the game feels too much like a Sony PS5 advertisement. Maybe if the mother ship looked different or like an actual ship, and the mini dual sense control airship looked a bit more like ship, this would’ve felt better. But I can understand why things are the way they are... Wow! This game is amazing! So much hard work and dedication went into it. At 15 hours long I’m surprised by the length. I was anticipating more around 9 or 10 hours. All around a genuine masterpiece of a video game.. One of the best games this year. The Playstation nostalgia made me smile the whole time.. Game World Navigator weighing in 3.5 months late with the 88 hot take — and leading with “rather short” lol. Refreshing to play a focused game that’s honed in on providing a consistently engaging / evolving experience from start to finish, rather than padding out unrewarding time. I don’t know about you, but 40 hours is enough for me (especially when it’s stuffed with never ending surprises). I 100% completed, which I rarely attempt, and will likely do it again. Guaranteed joy.. Nice game and its fun I was surprise it won GOTY.. Unexpected winner of the Game Awards, but I gave it a try anyway, and did not regret it. Amazing visuals, very colorful, and so much fun. It’s a true love letter to video games, with callbacks that people of all ages can enjoy and understand. The most fun I’ve ever had with a 3d platformer. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best 3D jump and run in a very long time. I even like it better than Mario Odyssey. I still think Crash Bandicoot 2 and 3 are better.. I love it. I think it’s my favourite game of all the games I’ve played for about 20 years or so. I think it deserves a huge round of applause for Team Asobi, for all the hard work they put in to make this happen. No wonder the game got an award as the best game of the year. Non-violent child-friendly game, I think every parent should buy this game for their children. And last but not least, a heart for all of the members of the wonderful team Asobi ️🩵🩷. The most fun I have had playing a game in years! You can tell a lot of love was put into this game. It definitely deserves more recognition.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's a good game with lots of fun characters and franchises added into it to change up some of the mechanics. Still feels like the game is severely overhyped though, yeh it's good but there are definitely better a host of games out there.. Great game. I want more this kind on playstation. Homage to the playstation legacy and to best platformers in history of gaming. Truly deserved GOTY.. This is video game in its essence. Although is a game for family focused on children, I have had a lot of fun and it's a nostalgic game for every playstation owner. Astro Bot is absolutely amazing, and one of the most deserved TGA GOTYs ever.. Game's absolutely amazing, and one of the most obvious rightfully earned TGA GOTYs ever. You angry? Still? Let it go now, seriously. And no, I'm sorry but I can assure you most people don't think Wukong deserved it. That's Metaphor and it's not even close. I don't agree, ofc.. I thought it was like Nintendo games. It's a lovely game that you can enjoy while smiling.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. such a thing, an ordinary robot that was in ps5, there was no need to make a full-fledged game out of it in which the mechanics are the same as everyone else, nothing new and interesting, an ordinary platformer in a beautiful wrapper.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Review bombing after GOTY? Lol it did its job...GOTY!!!! Haters gonna hate Well deserved. After 100%ing it, Astro Bot is just a fun game, it is pure joy and it shows even from the developers. This 3D platformer has incredibly creative level design, smooth and polished gameplay, and it keeps it fresh by introducing cool powerups Astro can use, and keep each level special and memorable, and this short and sweet experience that will keep you on your controller until you 100% it and do it 10 times over.. The industry is plagued by bad games or very unfinished ones or sometimes you encounter a very sweaty game that makes you question whether you are genuinely having fun or not. Astro bot is pure fun itself a platformer that uses the formula Nintendo established in the late 90's throwing it's own spin on it while also having 30 years of playstation history hidden in there. At first I was suprised that it won GOTY over Wukong but upon further inspection this game is just a game that gives you a fun time without sweating.. I bought it at full price after Astro Bot winning the Game of the Year award. No regrets. This game is a deserving game of the year. Simply wonderfull. Quality platforming with the life and love in every part of the game. Design is not repetitive and devs didn't recycle resources over and over again. Very refreshing.. Perfect game. Wonderful experience. I usually don't play this kind of game, but I absolutely love Astro Bot! Team Asobi has so much potential.. Probably one of the best modern day platformers ever made, and a worthy recipient of the GOTY title.. An amazing game, blending a perfect utilization of level design, hardware features, and 30 years of gaming history into one amazing package. One of the best, freshest platformers I've played in a long, long time.. The perfect game does exist, Where have you been? It absolutely deserved game of the year, as all its thought was put into the game behind the scenes to make sure that it was just pure, and honest. do all of that to make this perfected lovely game. it's an homage in more ways then one, and that way is to also make a loving attempt to become one of those games that people will pay homage to.. It does an excellent job of bringing the formula of Nintendo games. Unfortunately, it was only possible by copying everything in the smallest details, even the frametime of the animations from the Mario games. A mediocre experience, but a great aquisition to play for free on PS+, when available.. Big enjoyer of platformers, LBP is one of my favorite games of all time and after playing this I might have to put it higher than that. Such a joy to play from beginning to end.. One of the most fun and probably one of the best PS5 games. Definitely deserved GOTY, but not really best game direction, but Astro Bot still 10/10. Best game ever made. A joy from beginning to end. Mandatory to play at birth to create gamers.. The most fun game I've ever played. They did it. They actually beat Super Mario. I kneel.. Best game on PlayStation. And actual big and strong reason to have PlayStation. I really hope that Sony will make more games like that and less garbage like Concord or Horizon. Please Sony. I promise to buy every single game like that twice - physical and digital. Play this game don’t listen to the hate deserves the game of the year very nice game. It’s adorable play it. good game. worth playing. it deserves the game of the year. I love it..……10. Wow. All i could say is wow, this game is in my top 15 of all time! amazing gameplay and a compelling story really sells this game in for me 10/10. Nice game, pretty fun to play, loved it! I recommend it to the people that are a fan of Astro’s playroom. Amazing level design that features a wide variety of mechanics and endless creativity, along with stunning visuals and physics. Great game.. Lots of fun. I played this with my kids. They really enjoyed it. Very family friendly game. Only complaint is that it could have been a little longer.. A game for all. Innovative, incredibly fun with enough challenging sections to make it addictive and wanting to keep coming back. Also, very nice touch to have free dlc content especially the recent Christmas update which was another very well designed level.. Astro Bot starts strong with charming visuals but quickly feels shallow and uninspired. The gameplay lacks variety, making it hard to stay engaged for long sessions. While fun at first, it doesn’t offer much depth or replayability, leaving players wanting more substance.. Well deserved the GOTY this year. Well designed level, technically perfect, and full fun of 10 hours (20 hours for platinum). Good game for the visisting gusests to play in my living room. And these comment about Mario not get the GOTY, you should ask why Nintendo releases BOTW in the same year.. Solid gameplay, slick controls and superb level design. GOTY 100% well deserved.. GOTY was beyond justified. Innovative, colorful and a heartfelt love letter to gamers. All the salty trashkong players review bombing need a hobby and need to learn to stop crying. Cope and seethe. Astrobot sweep.. Great solid game, the developers wanted to make a simple platformer and passed with flying colours.. A simple, charming platformer that’s fun for all ages. Great music, super cute and lots of replay value. Fully recommend.. A beautiful love letter to the gaming world, no matter your age or your gamer ""rank"", Astrobot is pure joy, pure fun, pure game!. An absolute joy to play. It has so many nostalgic nods to the history of PlayStation. It has excellent use of Duel Sense and is as creative as any Mario game. Must play title!!!. Best game I have played in a long time far better than Mario! The levels are not to hard or not to easy best family game. The gameplay is okay. The music is bad compare to stellar blade music. The graphics is good compare to Minecraft. Overall mario.. I think it is a very good game. The concept has been exploited from various titles, but the different mechanics and worlds present in the game makes it distinctive.. Astro bot is 100% the WORST game of all time. The gameplay is boring (a total Mario galaxy rip off by the way) and they have the audacity to play on the nostalgia of Playstation ""fans"" by adding in dead games like Bloodborne while doing NOTHING with the IP. Just your typical show of corporate greed and how no matter the game, the contents or its lack of substance, People will guzzle the slop up like good little piggies. This game was made with love and passion.. Fantastic! The most pure fun and pleasing time I’ve had playing a game in a long time. Well deserving of GOTY. I know some people can’t believe this game is good because of how it looks, but once you play it, you’ll see it’s amazing. This Game is incredible, an exhilarating experience from start to finish. It’ll have you grinning the whole way through. The level designs are so unique and well put together, throwing out something special every few steps. The implementation of the haptic response is definitely some of the best out of all PS5 games too.. A masterpiece in gaming. Some of the best game mechanics and flair seen in a while. 100% deserves GOTY.. Absolute masterpiece and a beautiful ode to the history of PlayStation! The gameplay design is incredible and has plenty of truly unique mechanics that had me giggling and laughing with my kids while playing. Although most of the game is fairly easy for experienced players, there are really challenge bonus levels sprinkled throughout the game to keep","the game is always fun and engaging with cool abilities and every level is different . the moveset is simple, yet together with the power ups it's enough to make movement fun . every object makes a different sound when hit and creates a different vibration ."
550.Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration,"A solid improvement on the previous entry and a good sequel for the reinvigorated franchise. Great to have a Lara Croft game in this generation. Her abilities are improved, some cumbersome mechanics here and there. Claimed the trilogy free on PS plus so am slowly getting through them over Christmas. Worth a play at some point. Been a Tomb Raider fan since the PS2 & PSP days I really enjoyed this one, haven't played the one's thatreleased on PS3 I'm lookingto play thoseaswell.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is a dummy. The game itself, both gameplay and plot, is very bland. The game takes place in Siberia, but nothing except the tablets with Russian text (although it feels like they just wrote the text in Cyrillic, without even checking what they wrote there) refers to Russia. It seems that the game constantly promotes the discrediting of Russia. During the whole game, I did not hear a single phrase in Russian or at least with an accent. The same applies to fighters who address each other in the language and dressed in the uniform of the United States, which is not typical for Russians. And it would seem okay, but when the game takes place in Russia and there are 0 prerequisites for this, it completely ruins the immersion in the game. But they brought as many references as possible to the fact that Russia is the enemy and that's it, and it is not justified in any way plot-wise. The plot is about as worked out as what I described earlier. In a word, just to be there. The gameplay component starts to get boring after 10 hours. The whole drop on the map is monotonous, for the most part on the map you collect sticks, leaves, backpacks, cartridges, bottles, and all sorts of garbage. Moreover, if you decide to play the game only with a bow, most of everything on the map is absolutely useless. What's worth praising the game for is the graphics, it's really good here, and it's probably the most beautiful game I've played so far. In general, I am not experienced in this genre of games and all the disadvantages that I have voiced are peculiar to the adventure genre, but it did not go to me. Without graphics, I would rate this game on the ball 3 out of 10, with graphics 4.. I played 2013’s Tomb Raider reboot and thought the first 75% of the game was pretty good but the ending was rushed and not well-developed. Now you would think going into the second game they would work their hardest to rectify those writing mistakes. What’s that you say? Rise of the Tomb Raider did even worse? That’s right, the story here is so bad it might as well not even exist. I predicted every so-called ‘twist’ well before it was revealed. Every character here is completely unlikeable and none more so than Lara herself. I can’t stand what they’ve done to her in this reboot series. In the original, she was kick-butt, tomb robber *ahem* excuse me, raider, dual pistol wielding. Here, she’s a whiny little girl who can’t decide if she’s some archeologist searching for the world’s lost secrets or if she’s still working through her daddy issues and a bit psychotic who doesn’t care who she hurts in her quest, if she’s someone with no training taking out an entire army of seasoned mercenaries or being blind-sided by someone obviously wanting to kill her. The other characters barely get enough screen time to even attempt to establish what their motives are. Not to mention a certain character who shows up at just the right moment simply to prevent Lara from her goal and pretend like she cares about something for a change. The combat is a thousand steps back from the first one. You are always required to be zoomed in in order to shoot so if the enemy is fast, you’re going to be missing a lot. You have all these ‘different’ weapons in each category but there’s no real reason to switch. There’s one obviously best weapon in each category. The stealth is just sad. And if you take out an enemy or they notice when you miss a shot, well there’s no running off and hiding until they stop searching. In fact, they usually know exactly where you are. And if that isn’t enough the AI is programmed so brilliantly that they will often rush you, one after another, while holding a gun. Are they all trying to kamikaze me? After I managed to finish this lackluster game, I decided I hadn’t had enough with the bad and did the two DLCs: Baba Yaga and Croft Manor. All I can do is laugh the laugh of the crazy. Baba Yaga could have been cool. The hallucinations you initially endure are well-done and had me invested for all of the five minutes you get before it clears and you’re sent on a fetch quest to make a potion… What? I am not kidding. And it was completely obvious who Baba Yaga really was, the end fight was just do one thing several times, the enemies were just reusing assets, and the ending was so poor. I feel bad for anyone who paid for it separately. But the one that really takes the cake is Croft Manor. You think hey this might be a mini sequel, something akin to exploring the mansion in the original games. No, noooo, it is a complete collectathon of relics and documents so Lara’s uncle (on her mother’s side so how does he have claim on her father’s manor?) doesn’t kick her out of her own home. I’d like to know how much later this was made than the game itself because Lara’s voice actor couldn’t have phoned that in any harder. There was no emotion to her voice. Half the time I couldn’t tell what she was even saying as though she was speaking through mashed potatoes in her mouth. And if you swung around to stare at Lara’s face while she spoke, the lip movement was just open/close, no syncing at all. Neither of the DLCs were worth it or added anything to the story. In fact, this game tries to degrade the story with rewriting her father into this pathetic man. I got this real cheap and still feel I paid too much. I wish I had been paid to play it, at least then I would have got something from it. The worst part is that I also got the third game but have no motivation to even give it a try. It would be a miracle for there to be any positive upswing from here. Just don’t bother. If you must, play the first one, at least there was some attempt at innovation and fun.. I'll start off by saying that this is a great game and I enjoyed my time with it. It is very well animated, the graphics are great, the cinematics are solid, it's fairly engaging, and the gameplay itself is fun and exciting; but, it really doesn't do anything special, its just good, safe fun. now we get to the short comings... This is a collectathon. Most of the collectables seem pretty meaningless since there are so many of them, and are not directly tied to the story. The story is pretty boring and generic, with all of 5 other supplemental characters that have approximately 10 minutes of total dialogue. It's an okay story, but really not much complexity. They decided to change direction from the original Lara who was the ultimate fem fatale who could stand toe to toe with Bond and Indiana Jones to a college girl with daddy issues and a one track mind. Not a fan of the new direction, I feel like it is a step back for the influence of the media icon and women's empowerment. And now the biggest gripe... there was far too much video game jank in this title. We have all come to accept a bit of plot armor and that grip strength is the key to becoming a hero, but this game takes it way beyond what is reasonable to keep a player engaged. Minor spoilers for some of the unlocks, but the game tells you in prompts exactly what you need to get to the next area, so nothing too shocking. You pull down stone walls with your axe, but need a rope tied to an arrow to pull down a wood barricade? A 20 something college student with no formal training can take down a group of mercenaries in a tank top? They have been shooting assault rifles at you for hours, but you have to wait for them to unlock to be able to use them? They kind of missed the mark with continuity.. Better than the original Xbox One release. The PS4 version features improved graphics, VR support and all DLC. The physical copy also includes an artbook. This is an excellent action/adventure game. It's the best installment in the ""Survival"" trilogy and holds its own against ""Uncharted 4"". My main criticism would be the amount of hidden collectibles to find. There's simply too many of them. But thankfully, you don't have to find everything in order to progress the story. Overall, this is one of the best ""Tomb Raider"" games ever made. I would rate it with a 9.1 out of 10.. The most complete modern Tomb Raider package, the DLCs are decent and worth checking out. A grand sequel, this game is an improvement over the first game in every way possible. The biggest improvement here is the gameplay, it's more accessible, and feels grounded with additional mechanics that make it feel more like a survival game where you have to manage your **** for the puzzles, they're great, every puzzle is creative and very unique, all in all very enjoyable. The side content is more than enough, exploration is one of the game's strongest points, there's a good amount of side quests to do, tombs to raid, secrets to uncover and collectibles to find. What didn't really surprise me is the overall story. It's very similar to the first game in some ways but it's not as dark, and the writing is straight up weak, predictable plot twists and characters making questionable decisions. Last but not least, this is my favorite version of Lara Croft, I think she looks the best in this game, and she's very likeable. This is my favorite Tomb Raider game. Final Rating: ""Good"" ~ 7/10.. Very good sequel to the first game and the best of the reboot trilogy. However having played this so soon after the first one the only complaint I would make is that it's very much more of the same. The developers took very few risks. Nothing really new to make it stand apart, and even the story follows exactly the same beats (ending with a battle against an undead army before climbing a tower and confronting the end boss). I was also quite disappointed the locales were the same all the way through. The first game was set on a tropical island. Here you're in snowy tundra. They even had a short segment at the very beginning set in a desert landscape but never came back to it. I prefer games that take you off to numerous different places like in an uncharted game. The dlc is good, allowing you to explore croft manor. I wasn't able to lock anyone in a freezer though.. This game is a worthy successor of the 2013 'Tomb Raider'. The game adds a lot of depth to the character and gameplay. I played them back to back and it was a blast.. Very good game.Good graphics, good combat system,Very good story.I love this game.. Once again, so much good wrapped in such mediocrity. This one is hard to review. Despite the incredible variety that you eventually get in gameplay mechanics as you level up, as a whole it still got samey and tedious to finish. Still a solid entry in the franchise, though.. The highly anticipated sequel to the acclaimed reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise, takes players on an extraordinary adventure filled with adrenaline-pumping action, breathtaking landscapes, and a compelling narrative. The visual aspects of Rise of the Tomb Raider are nothing short of breathtaking. The meticulously crafted environments are rich with intricate details, showcasing stunning landscapes, weather effects, and lifelike character models. From icy Siberian peaks to ancient ruins, the game's graphics enhance immersion and contribute to an engaging gameplay experience. Rise of the Tomb Raider is a triumph, seamlessly blending elements of exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving. Lara Croft's movements and actions feel fluid and natural, allowing for intuitive traversal through the diverse landscapes. The combat mechanics are polished, providing a satisfying blend of stealth and action-oriented gameplay. The narrative in Rise of the Tomb Raider is a compelling continuation of Lara Croft's journey as she searches for answers and battles against a secretive and malevolent organization. The storyline is engaging, unveiling secrets of ancient civilizations while delving into Lara's character development and determination. The emotional depth of the plot is accentuated by strong voice acting and well-written dialogues, making for a gripping narrative from start to finish. The game excels in providing vast, open-world environments for players to explore. Hidden tombs, challenging puzzles, and a multitude of collectibles encourage players to venture off the beaten path, rewarding curiosity and discovery. The audio design in Rise of the Tomb Raider greatly contributes to the immersive atmosphere of the game. The sound effects, whether echoing footsteps in a cave or the howling wind in a blizzard, add a layer of realism to the experience. The musical score complements the gameplay, intensifying the emotional impact of pivotal moments and enhancing the overall narrative. Rise of the Tomb Raider successfully builds upon its predecessor, delivering an outstanding gaming experience that captivates players with its stunning visuals, engaging gameplay mechanics, and compelling storyline. Lara Croft's journey in this installment is an unforgettable adventure, making this game a must-play for fans of the action-adventure genre.. I especially loved this sequel to Tomb Raider. They somehow improved Lara Croft's design even more, and the gameplay was spectacular. The story was well crafted, and the voice acting and performances were just as great as its predecessor.. one of the greatest action games out there, from game play to graphics to sound quality everything is AAA about this, as of now 2023, this is the best Tomb Raider game Ever.... it's a 10 for me. Was really surprised with this game! I have never played a Tomb Raider game prior to this one, as they never really seemed to interested me. But once I got to playing this game I was really hooked upon the first couple of days of playing. The setting and gameplay are amazing! I’m always a **** for snow setting survival games and this one is right up my alley. The game does get sort of repetitive after a while and caused me to just speed my way to completing it after a two days of doing missions,side quest, exploring. Nonetheless it’s an amazing game to get into if it is your first Tomb Raider experience as it was with me. Enjoyable game and good graphics. 8/10 gameplay 8/10 graphics 8/10 story 8/10 environments. amazing story , good graphics and overall a good game, had lots of fun with it. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. i have not finished this game and i dont think i ever will, i got through to around 25 per cent of this game which took me 6 hours but I'm done. After the Jacob introduction, this game just gets so **** boring it's insane. i had to convince myself to play it and each time and I could only sit down playing through like an hour each session. honestly, the mechanics and improvements gameplay-wise are so well done but the writing annoys me so much and it falls flat. each time I had to endure the story/ dialogue it felt like a cheese grater was being used on my brain. there are a lot of cool new tools and stuff but the game just feels so lacklustre even with them and the characters are boring as hell. the game looks beautiful, i didnt expect it to look like that. camilla luddington killed it as usual and her VA is pog. a lot of useless **** on the map too, almost felt like i was playing a Ubisoft game. not as thrilling as the last game but idk maybe it got better after you sludge through like 9 hours of the story.. What a great sequel to another great game. This game has a beautiful setting, a pretty simple story, yet absolutely enough for what it is and does not need any more answers - except for the obvious question of what happens next in Lara's life and one, two major question that come with the end that surely is answered in the next game, but overall for the normal storyline it is fine as it is. I also liked that my assumption about a certain character was revealed to be true in the end. The game plays very nicely, though I have the feeling the controls are a little bit less working than in the first game, the atmosphere the game has is just wonderful and Lara is simply ""one kickass woman who rocks entirely"". I was a bit worried at first that the most obvious natural setting would be shown almost all the time - the snowy one - but I was really glad when I noticed it was a mix. Great snow areas, sunny forest and lake area, a few ruins here and there, definitely superb. However, it was a bit underwhelming that certain parts just reminded too much of moments that happened in the first game. I do not mind that much in general but this feeling definitely does not need to be this strong for part 3. Also a few battles were a bit frustrating when compared to the others but I can live with that. All in all a great and recommendable game that was worth for me to wait 3-4 years.. Actually a 9.5 because i dont think its a perfect game. It did everything the franchise always did but made it all better, Lara Croft always beautiful and great and the story is very engaging. Graphics, gameplay and music are all around great.. Rise of the Tomb Raider 20 Year Celebration Edition is a true festivity of the legacy of Lara Croft!. The camera shake is so bad, the game is unplayable. This game is completely trash.. This game is a HUGE improvement compared to the 2013 one specially the graphics it was a huge improvement and the history is more rich and interesting that the first one.. You need check game out one the best game and lot action shooter game and excellent graphic and good music and has zombie and good day. Just as 'Shadow of the Tomb Raider', it is a very comprehensive game, with a large map to explore, variety of side missions, weapons to upgrade and an interesting storyline. Great graphics and gameplay; difficult to fault the game. For the fans of Uncharted, this is a must!. Really nice graphics and gameplay good as in previous one. Story was bit weaker but we got nice flashback on Lara past. Overall 7/10 as of 2023.. great game of lara croft, the best of the reboot, it is a pity that the next one was not up to the task. This game has been a true disappointment. I have played it cause I really enjoyed the previous game. This game is the generic open world game 546#. The gameplay is not bad at all, the gameplay is the same as the previous game but it includes some sneaking mechanics. The story and the open world is the worst part, the world has no essence, it feels premodeled. The story is mediocre all times and very bad sometimes, there are a lot of inconsistencies.. This game is a classic masterpiece. I played my first TR in the '90s. This game continue improving for years and reached the best game-ever level for me.. Perfect sound, graphic,plot. A little bit boring gameplay,but locations and storytelling 100/10. Great game, beautiful graphics, great story and amazing gameplay 10/10 would 100% recommend. This game is one of my top 3 favorite games of all time and Lara Croft is my favorite gaming character of all time. This game is truly a masterpiece in every way. The graphics, the story, the characters and the voice acting all a ten out of ten. I really hope they get Camilla to come back to do more games because she was fantastic. The open world and environment is jaw dropping in this game and there was so much to do. Loved the challenges and one of the hardest platinums i have had to earn. Knocked it out of the park with this game and its one that I will be played for many years down the road.. Incredibly well-written story and equally good gameplay. The gameplay is so awesome that you feel more like you're watching a movie than playing a game. The graphics of the game are very nice. Especially the environment of Siberia is very well done. I would especially pick up Gulag. The characters are likable and believable. If you come across this game like I did, on sale or discount, definitely buy it. The game runs on ps5 without any issues or glitches. I rate it the same as the previous part 9/10.. A sequel to the 2013 reboot of the series, Rise of the Tomb Raider follows Lara Croft as she ventures into Siberia in search of the legendary city of Kitezh which promises the secret of immortality. She soon runs into a mysterious military organization known as Trinity, which intends to take the secret for their own nefarious means. While I personally quite enjoyed the 2013 reboot many fans were understandably disappointed with the increased focus on combat rather than exploration and puzzle solving. This follow up certainly redresses the balance by not only introducing better stealth mechanics, but also through the inclusion of optional challenge tombs that each offer a reward or upgrade for solving the contained puzzle. There are still plenty of faults with this game of course, from the unnecessary hand-holding, intrusive cut-scenes and poor melee combat but as with the first title in this rebooted series I largely enjoyed my time with it and I think fans of the older games will find this more to their liking as well.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Maybe not as good as the first one, but lot of effort is put in this game. The story is rich with fantastic set pieces.. Best from the trilogy. An absolute classic! I dont know how much i have replayed this one. We love SP games and the game industry should do more of these and stay away from the ""game as a service"" idea - because NO. Glad that the franchise is not in square enix's hands - i was worried for the future of this LEGENDARY reboot but the fourth is comming and i cant wait.. i enjoyed this. gameplay was awesome but sometimes the story was poorly written. loved the little objects you had chance to find and lara's comments to them. lara is one of my favourite female characters tho.. most boring tomb riderof the whole saga.. poop story and still glitched.... The best game in the style of historical adventure with great characterization. For me this part took a step forward compared to the previous part. From the better graphic to the more complete story- the whole components beacme better and more elaborate. Yes, it is still the same Tomb Raider, it is one mane storylane, there are almost same skill trees, the same game mechanics and playstyles, of course a lot of similar puzzles, tombs and treasures. But in Rise all these components are made much much better and in sum with the whole world and it's atmosphere it was pleasent and interesting for me to play the game.. Surprisingly immersive with stunning graphics, action-packed game play, and RPG-like levelling system. Played most of the Tomb Raider games, and Rise is definitely top-tier and redefines Tomb Raider on the PS4. There is a balanced mix of story, exploration, puzzles, pinch of stealth and shoot the bad guys game play, and it all worked to deliver a really fun gaming experience. The game has enough cut-scenes to tell the story, and the transition between cut-scenes to game play is smooth and keeps the player immersed. There are also plenty of skills and equipment, including skins for various attires that are readily available and a few can be unlocked from game play. Controls are responsive but take a bit of time to get used to. AI in the game is pretty good and challenging, enemies coordinate to flank, throw grenades or rush to melee. Exploration and puzzles provide a nice change of pace from the intense fire fights, puzzles are challenging enough that you don't need to look at a guide. Downside, the micro-transactions for ""virtual card collectibles"" that thankfully do not impact the game play. Console game publishers and devs need to stop and leave the micro-transactions for the ""pay-to-play"" mobile games and MMOs. Overall, playing Rise of the Tomb Raider is a fun and immersive experience. Its like watching a movie and playing a game at the same time. The game is worth playing and at current sale prices (bought mine $15 brand new), its a must have game for the PS4.. I just fell in love with this one. The gameplay is top tier as always. The story is next level and a huge improvement from the first installment. Fantastic settings. I just love it so much.. Note: You do not need to have played the previous game in order to understand this one. This is a really good game and I would highly recommend check it out. I rated 7 out of 10 because it doesn't bring anything outstanding to the table. At times the movement feels a bit janky and the developers haven't done anything that new comparing to the 1st game. I wish they would just pay a little attention to detail rather then having it just work and then leaving it as that. Even small things like when your climbing rock walls leaving marks where the climbing axe was, actually tie the rope to the post rather then slapping it against it and then it appears on, leaving a knife mark on an animal you just skinned instead of it being completely untouched and the list goes on. The overall movement in this game is responsive but maybe a little too responsive. This just comes down to opinion but I would prefer it if everything wasn't instant. If I looking in 1 direction Lara is facing the opposite it's weird how she can turn around in a split second. Overall the mechanics in this game have been rushed. They got to the point where it worked well enough and left it without a bit of extra polish to make it feel as real as possible. Not to say they don't work but a company the size of Crystal dynamics I know that can do better. The underwater was garbage and had no vertical movement. Puzzles in this game are great and I can't flaw them. Overall they weren't so easy that I would solve at 1st glance but I would be able to solve them after 5 to 10 minutes. I never felt frustrated and needed to look up a guide. Sadly there was no where near as many puzzles as the 1st game. Some tombs were replaced with crypts which annoyed me. (Crypts are just caves that don't have a puzzle or anything and have a unique in). I am not sure if its just me but this game felt allot smaller overall compared to the 1st one (Tomb Raider DE). I found myself spending allot more time in the same area and there was allot less missions. But in that case they made up for it elsewhere right? Ummm no, you get some crap multiplayer mode with these cards and stuff. I played it once for about 15 minutes and it bored the hell out of me. These cards work as power ups or handy caps. Power ups remove score bonus and handy caps increase it. You shoot enemies and need to find your way through the area by findings keys and stuff. Sounds fun but it's not. Its rushed and its basically a game mode the devs have created as a way to incorporate micro-transactions into the game as of course they wouldn't be able to do this with the single player campaign. It mite be for some people but it really isn't for me. The worst part is the cards are basically essential. You get tons for free thou as they give you packs with the DLC which comes with the game now. The thing is there is plenty of better multiplayer experiences on different game so why am I going to play this. Overall its a good game. I just wish they spent more time making a better, longer story rather then cut a huge chunk off the campaign for some generic, boring co-op mode in order to plunge micro-transactions into the game. That seems to be the way now thou. Make a solid game that gets good sales. Expand upon the series with a game thats monitized but sacrifice parts of the game in order to meet deadlines. Also why the hell has this game only got bronze trophies? No gold, no silver, just bronze (And of course platnum). Was so confused when I seen this. Trophys are quite common in this game. I got around 30 or something after completing the game along side the baba yoga side story DLC. I haven't played shadow of the tomb raider yet but I am going to now. So I can not speak yet on what has improved and what's stayed the same. They may have fixed some of the things I have mentioned.. A great game & sequel to the first game. The story, gameplay, graphics and sound are great. I enjoyed this game and it kept me so engaged that I had to find all secrets and collectibles. I highly recommend this game.. Pretty decent game. Definitely inspires from Uncharted which isn't a bad thing at all and this is what the new reboot needed. I really enjoyed the gameplay when it came to puzzles and climbing. However gunplay and encounters felt stiff and level design wasn't good for encounters. The story is fine nothing too interesting and characters are ok too.. I enjoyed playing Tomb Raider 2013 and I started playing it. Story: 9,1/10 Gameplay: 9,8/10 parkour, shooting and exploration are very well. I was pleasantly surprised with this title. Although I enjoyed the reboot title from 2013, I wasn't expecting so much improvement and variation in this title. The game has so much quality content, new game mechanics, more grounded and less tedious puzzle solving. The skills improvement makes a welcomed comeback with more upgrades, helping to adjust the game to your style, whether it's a stealth or full gun blazing approach. All the weapons have surprisingly deep upgrade system, often those upgrades have a visual impact and sometime audio impact on the weapons. Exploring caves in side missions got so much larger and more varied than in the previous title. Plenty of the locations are gorgeous to watch and even more exciting to explore. The only cons I can think of is the ending. I won't be spoiling anything, but for me the last 1-2 hours is too jammed with action and unnecessarily long puzzles. It felt like they tried to be more like Uncharted... which they don't need, they're doing so much better on their own. And that clickbait for the next game... There was no need. But ignore my nitpicking. This is a great game, especially for the current price, it's a bargain. I'm off to try Rise Of the Tomb Raider dlc.. Better than previous one. Well designed levels and good gameplay dynamic management.. To put it simply... this game i absolutely amazing! Square Enix did the impossible. They absolutely blew Tomb Raider (2013) out of the waters. From the compelling storyline and well crafted characters to the beautiful and vast settings of Siberia, this game is a masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For 2016, the game is very good. Few games in 2021-2022 can compete with her. Beautiful graphics, interesting gameplay, memorable characters, well-developed locations, great music, but the plot turned out to be not chic, quite simple, but sincere. There are bugs, both minor and funny, and those that start to infuriate you, because of which you feel constrained in the gameplay and the developers' imaginations (although sometimes the game was surprising in a good way), but they are not so critical. Sometimes the game picked up too fast a pace, sometimes on the contrary it stretched the grind, it is, of course, not necessary, but I don’t want to leave uncompleted places on the map, although at the moment I didn’t go through the game 100%, I’m too tired of walking through the tombs, and look for documents in large locations. Speaking of documents and relics: it is really interesting to study, interesting stories that reveal the plot or simply complement the picture of the whole game history, as if you were attending a history lesson. There are claims to the game: since I played the game for the first time in the series, I played on the difficulty ""Experienced robber"", and the game did not show me difficult, the problem is most","a solid improvement on the previous entry and a good sequel for the reinvigorated franchise . the game itself, both gameplay and plot, is very bland . the gameplay component starts to get boring after 10 hours ."
551.Uncharted: Drake's Fortune,"An amazing and ground breaking game… for its time. While I do enjoy it very much, I cannot deny that this game hasn’t exactly aged like fine wine. The controls and especially the camera are janky, the climbing and combat are at their weakest in the series, and overall this game is filled to the brim with Jank’. But this game is really good regardless. It has a short and simple story that perfectly fits with the “playable movie” that Naughty Dog was going for. This game also has some pretty good action set pieces (excluding the jet ski segment , had to dock a point for that bull$h!t,) and the gameplay itself, while definitely the weakest in the series, is still quite enjoyable besides the ever present jank’, While definitely not the best in the series, this game is definitely worth your time! 7/10. Good but the gameplay meeehhh, combat is outdated asf. Definitely the weakest Uncharted game. A rough start. As iconic and important it is, when it comes to the gameplay and the level design, it definitely aged quite a bit. Even though the story is very basic, I liked the twists near the end, in fact the final stretch of the game is really good, and the action is great. I also liked some of the puzzles, they're not really challenging or anything, just fine. The gameplay is mediocre though, some mechanics don't work properly, and there are some frustrating sections due to the clunky controls. Honestly, I like the game but it's not really memorable, I only recommend it to those who want to play every game in the series, otherwise you can easily skip this one and you won't really miss anything. Final Rating: ""Decent"" ~ 6/10.. As a player who played Uncharted 4 and the lost legacy first I have to say that the vibe of this game is just **** story is good and sometimes unexpected.. 8.7/10. This hasn't aged well but at the time it was amazing. Compared to later games in the series the action is honestly pathetic but you got to appreciate it for the game that started it all.. Uncharted original outing, fails to impress. It is shocking this title managed to have a sequel developed. While in hindsight, this was a good thing as all future titles a massive improvement on this snooze ****.. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is where the series began, but honestly, it hasn't aged well at all. The gameplay feels clunky and outdated, with repetitive combat and linear levels that offer little in terms of exploration or challenge. But what really drags it down is the writing. Everything happens at just the right time, and characters are exactly where they need to be, no matter the distance or circumstances—it's insane. The story relies heavily on coincidences that strain credulity, making it hard to get invested in the plot or the characters. The visuals might have been impressive back then, but now they just highlight how far games have come. Overall, it's a rough start that doesn't hold up against modern standards.. Feels like a trial run for some of Naughty Dog's future classics. Still, the combat and exploration are quite fun.. great game that clearly took on inspiration from lara croft, u start off playing as nate in a wetsuit since u re in a boat and elena is also in a wetsuit which is great, u also have photo mode in the ps4 version, and the game looks fantastic and i love the vibe and the story has a lot of soul since the performance of the actors carry this entire thing. big like. (For clarity I played the Remastered version on PS5) The game has aged quite well and the gameplay overall still feels smooth. Unlike a lot of other games from the time. Unfortunately its the game design that lets this game down. Its good and it goes well until you reach the bunker. After that the monsters start coming at you and the gameplay goes to ****. Enemies that you cant melee, will overwhelm you and charge you. And the guns are slow, clunky and horrible to aim with barely any ammo around. What could to wrong? I dont really know what the devs were thinking because up until this point its a very good game. The story overall is decent, not majorly special but its good. Nate, Helena and Sully get on nicely and the overall plot including some history is nice, even if not as in depth as the other games. ALSO WHO THE HELL DECIDED DODGE AND COVER SHOULD BE THE SAME BUTTON???????. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Yes, I'm one of those guys who started with Uncharted 4... not the smartest idea but at least I really liked that game. I finally got around playing the first Uncharted game, usually regarded as the weakest game in the series, so I got into the game with low expectations, and... that was actually a smart idea. Not to say Drake's Fortune is a bad game, far from it, but it's definitely weaker than a game like... well, A Thief's End, for example. What surprised me in Drake's Fortune is the story; it's kind of generic for the most part, sure, but it has some nice plot points sprinkled through it and it keeps things intriguing from beginning to end. The characters are fine too; the antagonists are largely forgettable unfortunately, but everyone else is likable and cool. Also, the visuals, while obviously outdated, they don't look bad, and the set-pieces and even some animations hold up pretty well. As for the gameplay, unfortunately, it's kind of a mixed bag; the controls and the shooting mechanics feel somewhat fine thanks to the remastered version, but the gameplay loop overall is very repetitive, the platforming, the movement and the cover system all feel floaty and clumsy, and the puzzles are just too simple and easy, they barely even feel like puzzles. Pros: + Interesting story + Likable characters + Good set-pieces Cons: - Repetitive gameplay loop - Awkward platforming and handling - Easy puzzles Narrative: 5/10 Gameplay: 5/10 Content: 5/10 Characters: 5/10 Music: ?/10 Graphics/Audio: ?/10 Final Rating: 6/10 - Decent - Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is merely a promising beginning for the Uncharted series, nothing more and nothing less, and it's also one that leaves room for improvement in about every single way. Do I recommend it?: Only if you're planning on getting into the series, otherwise, not really.. Played the remastered version. It was a fun game to play specially considering the time it released, but, man, the combat is really annoying, especially taking cover.. For the year it was released, this game is beautiful! And I just don't give it full marks because Uncharted is full of puzzles and I hate puzzles. Decent story but terrible gunplay the camera is all over the place and very frustrating puzzles. It's not got the best graphics of the uncharted series but I think that it has the best story and antagonists.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This first installment in the series is good fun. It's a combination of ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Gears of War"". Developer Naughty Dog (Jak and Daxter) fused puzzles and platforming with intense cover-based shooting. This was their first PS3 creation. It is an homage to old-time Hollywood serials, especially the Indiana Jones films. While ""Drake's Fortune"" isn't a masterpiece, it still looks fantastic and is a joy to play. I would rate it with an 8.6 out of 10.. Not just one of the best PS3 games, but one of the best games of all time! And would be in my top ten games ever.. While Uncharted Drake's Fortune is the weakest of the series all the elements in storytelling in future titles that I love can be found here. Its just a shame the the while Uncharted is a fun game at the end of the day it is a familiar one, not quite bland but approaching it.. I hate this game. The story is good and it has it's moments where it's fun but I can't ignore the fact that this game is a mess. Play it but just know the sequels are so much better.. Good intro the universe and characters, but way too much climbing. Combat is clunky and dated but the story was decent with a cool supernatural twist.. Its a good game but it marks the start of something beatiful - Uncharted series.. Every single enemy feels like a sniper lmao. But this is a really fun game. Such an iconic first entry title to the franchise.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A great game overall with some irritating controls that make for frustrating moments far too often. The forgiving checkpoint system does help it from being too annoying though.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As someone who grew up as an xbox player i was always curious about the playstation exclusives. Uncharted being one of them that I was envious I never got to experience initially. Well that is until now. A thoroughly enjoyable experience with action packed fun. A lead protagonist that is witty and charming. The first in the franchise leaves a great impression. I can't wait to play the next installment.. Uncharted 1 really does feel like a game that only gets slack because of the fact that NaughtyDog were able to reskin the concept 4 different times. Even then, Uncharted 1 remains to be the worst of the bunch, given that its gameplay and story has aged like curdled milk. The plot follows the egocentric Nathan Drake as he attempts to find the infamous El Dorado, which for some reason in this game isn't a shiny golden city but rather a boring sarcophagus. To be fair, as a campy, mindless action movie Uncharted 1 does get a few things right. It's over dramatic which makes the cutscenes pretty entertaining, even if the overall plot is riddled with more holes than a firing squad victim. The story is nice as a distraction, but only as a distraction. Actually competency is almost no where to be found. Gameplaywise this game has absolutely felt its aged. Climbing around structures sounds fun, but does not play fun in this game as Nathan slips and slides all over when trying to position him for a jump. I guess shooting is overall decent, but absolutely nothing to write home about, especially how much it gets one up by the following sequels. Gameplay in general never tends to evolve over the 10 hour runtime, which leads to things getting really boring. It's shoot, climb, solve puzzle, repeat. Same enemies, same guns, same iffy quips. Overall, I'd say skip this entry and just play the other games. Uncharted 2 is especially where it gets good. Final Rating: (5.5/10). I am so glad this is one of the first narrative-driven games I ever played. The writing is phenomenal, and it would go on to be a staple for future Naughty dog games. The game looks good for the time. nothing crazy but its aged alright. The villains are both kind of ass, particularly Roman, but I really didn't care all that much due to how much fun I was having the three mainstays, who are all some of my favorites in gaming. The only reason this game couldn't ten or nine is because of the gameplay. Don't get me wrong, its not bad. Good fun can be had with it, but it generally follows the same formula of 'enter a big space, hide behind objects, maybe throw a grenade, and shoot'. Again, not bad, I'd give it a 6.5 to a 7, but its really not blowing anyone' socks off. Also the platforming is a little too weighty for my liking. Other than those small qualms, this game is fricking awesome, and you should definitely check it out if you haven't already.. this game was like ohh yeahhh imma be pretty frickin epic and 'twas. Certain games really show their age and this is one of them. The climbing is slightly janky, the combat is boring and straightforward, and the story is...well that's actually quite fun. I'm sure when there were less games of this type on the market this was a great game to play. Nowadays, when there are many other games that do the same thing but better -- partly due to how prolific the uncharted series is -- this isn't really worth playing. It somehow feels like a long game even though it's only ten hours long; I blame the jetski sections. You're given a high-powered jetski that you want to ride as quickly as possible but they litter the lake full of explosive barrels so you need to stop every few seconds to shoot one. Who playtested this? Unless you're a die-hard uncharted fan who needs to know all of the lore, I'd give this one a miss.. It's mostly just a predictable, bad B-movie. The shooting is tedious and overly repetitive to the point where it wears out its welcome by the halfway point. The game seems to have sold purely on graphics for its time alone. The characters are flat, the game plays quite poorly, and everything is really drawn out for no reason. It's like it should have been an hour long tech demo that got bloated into a full release for marketing reasons.. little boring dont like that much but is very good 2 better 2 best of al time. One of the most overrated games on playstation. A plot that is based on clichés and stereotyped characters. Advise against. Really just forgettable compared to the sequels. It looks a bit dated, with a saturated color-palette, the environments aren't really memorable, and blend together by the end. The gameplay (not many guns like the later entries, and also the most simplistic climbing) and story also aren't much better. The set pieces (specially the **** jet-ski levels) are almost a joke compared to the ones in Uncharted 2 and 3. In the end it's just a kind of forgettable Indiana Jones homage. I would probably give it a 4.5 to a 5 if it wasn't for the ship level, which is by far the best set piece in the game, and is so good it bumps the game up to a 5.5/10. Great story great set of characters but terrible vehicle levels and boss fight. I still wonder how they did sequels. But I'm glad they did. The worst Uncharted,. The perfect introduction to a great seriers. However in todays standards the gameplay feels a little outdated.. Graphics: 5/10; Storyline: 6/10; Gameplay: 7/10; Atmosphere: 6/10; Music: 8/10; Summary rating: 6/10. A super game especially considering when it was made. Too many needless climbing and jumping tasks, and a handful of bizarre puzzles. I had to YouTube to figure out. Fantastic story with great dialogue. The finale for me was a bug-ridden mess, that made me leery of subsequent Uncharted titles. I would have rated a 9 if not for the finale mess. Very fun, engaging & addictive game.. Like a lot of people i came to this after playing it's illustrious sequels and though Uncharted 2 & 3 had bigger set pieces and slightly more refined controlls this is still everything we've come to love about Drakes adventures;. excellent gameplay, much more boring than the second game, nonetheless a good introduction for nathan drake.. Gameplay - 6 Plot & Characters - 7 Storytelling - 8 Pacing - 7 Music & Sound - 8 Replayability - 5 Performance - 10. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. I have played the remastered version, in general the game is beautiful and pleasant, the fact that Naughty Dog has moved from the style of cartoon games and fictional characters to realistic games with this game is really great and unbelievable. Because many of those whose game style has been third-person shooters since the beginning still can't make a game like this. The gameplay was great, but the only problem was that the fights in the game were too many and the balance between the fights and parkour work. It didn't exist, and the final fight in the ship could have been more beautiful and pleasant (just like the final fight of Uncharted 4 or TLOU 2), the story of the game was also beautiful, especially at the end, when it became extremely exciting and stressful (from Since the Daemons attacking Nathan and Eddie really increased the level of the story of the game), I wrote this review in 2023 and you definitely can't ignore the other Naughty Dog games from 2007 to 2023, and I'm the only one for this reason. I will lower the score because other Naughty Dog games are more attractive compared to Uncharted 1... Overall, this was a very attractive and excellent game.. Action adventure game that sees an Indiana Jones style character tracking clues and dodging traps and villains around the globe; in other words, Tomb Raider: The Next Generation. Its nicely cinematic in style with pretty graphics and likeable characters which makes up for a few **** like the occasionally wayward camera angles making for some overly fiddly platform sections. It feels a little unsophisticated compared to the likes of Assassin's Creed, but it's still fun to play.. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune takes players on an exhilarating journey filled with pulse-pounding action and treasure-hunting adventures. Developed by Naughty Dog, the game's strong points lie in its captivating storyline, immersive environments, and dynamic gameplay. However, it falls short in certain areas, preventing it from reaching the highest echelons of gaming excellence.. In my experience, it's one of the best games of Ps3. I have no doubt. The characters are able to concern you and the plot is amazing. The reason I don't put the 10 is due to sequel are better than it.. The first PS3 I completed and very much enjoyed. It is a visual delight and story-telling masterpiece. The game play echoes of Tomb Raider, but creates a niche of its own. The lead characters are very comical and lovable and you can see the chemistry bubbling between Nathan and Elena throughout the game. Breath-taking stuff. My only issue is that there was lots and lots of gun play and shooting, which did add variety, but was over done and excessive. The puzzles and exploration was awesome nonetheless.. Although now slightly outdated in terms of controls and overall design, it's still a fun console shooter and a solid foundation for even better sequels.. Amazing game. Fantastic story. Interactions between the characters made the game extremely realistic and made me feel like I was inside the game. Gameplay, story, presentation of the story, level design, everything is amazing.. Great game. I loved playing it. Amazing plot, great characters and graphics, I totally recommend it.. Pretty nice game. It was first uncharted and not everything was polished. Pretty nice plot. First entry of the saga, the history is pretty basic but you will love the characters right from the begining,. The definition of mediocre. This game does nothing special and even manages to struggle with simple elements of any shooter game. Games like that are responsible for the idea of ""shooter games are not made to console"". No, they are just badly handled. The sensitivity and aim acceleration almost made this game unplayable for me. Shooting heads, doing flicks, and being versatile are crazy hard in this game because Naughty Dog can't understand what makes shooter games so good to the niche community (I mean, niche at the time, since everybody plays some shooter rn). If you are a casual player, this probably won't bother you though. Another element that is present mostly in the game and is mediocre af is climbing. Or fake climbing, being accurate. Is so scripted that becomes boring. You almost can fail and precision was never in the discussion. Just spam X to jump and you are good. That's sad since climbing should be the identity of this game. Also, there's not much scenario variation. The story is much simple. Really predictable. But to be honest, its uncommitted tone matches with Drake. I also consider him fun, with made the experience a little better. The characters are good either. I liked some jokes either. Anyway, I expect the next game to correct some mistakes from this one. Since it's a 2007 game, I understand at some point. Even then, my experience was not great.. Love this game even though it’s so outdated and desperately needs a remaster.. Played it on PS4, 3 years ago. My first experience in Uncharted series. Controls are very good and the story kept me active.. Uncharted:Drake's Fortune is a great start to the best game series for PS3. Great parkour and shooting, but an interesting story unfortunately lacks character development, which is not very good, and monotonous jungle. While the game is trying to diversify itself, for example, a spooky level with an abandoned German bunker time of WWII with mutants is very atmospheric and cool, what can not be said about the level with the boat, which is annoying.. The fascinating plot does not let you get bored throughout the game. It has everything: interesting puzzles, exploration of ancient ruins, shooting, and horror elements at the end. A solid 9 out of 10.. Strong graphics, combat, and characters carry this game despite some janky controls and a jarring final stretch that feels oddly placed compared to the rest of the campaign.. The first ""Uncharted"" isn't a masterpiece, but it is great fun. At the time of release, this was looked upon as a next-gen ""Tomb Raider"" with a male protagonist. Thanks to the PS3's graphical capabilities, the game resembled a Hollywood movie. It blended ""Prince of Persia""-like platforming with the cover-based shooting of ""Gears of War"". Almost 11 years old, ""Uncharted"" is still highly enjoyable. However, in hindsight, it's clear that Naughty Dog hadn't perfected the formula. There are a few segments that drag the pacing down to a halt. Despite its shortcomings, I would rate ""Drake's Fortune"" with an 8.5 out of 10,. **** game, the gunplay and the action is the worse of the year 2007, only good graphism but nothing else to get my interest even the scenario. This game should be mix of things I like, but leaves me really disappointed as it is mediocre in all aspects. The platforming is too simple even when compared to older games. The shoot and cover is not bad, but kinda tidious with unending waves of enemies. Some modesty in number of enemies would suite the whole game better. There are few puzzles, but it is rather following instructions from diary rather then something you would have to solve yourself. The story is fun, but could have been bit better than just some B movie version of Indiana Jones filled with cooky cutter personalities. Also the game is quite short, but that is probably good. I get that this was of the first AAA games on PS3, so the people were hyped, but how some serious reviewers could have give this game 10 points is beyond me. The potential was big, but wasted.. Uncharted a Drake's Fortune , is the one of best Action Adventure what i played ever.. The story here is dumb and gets worse the more you actually think about it, the combat is serviceable, but lacks many of the set pieces or interesting shooting galleries' that later games have, and the game is bogged down by really basic uninteresting climbing sections which are supposed to provide low points before more shootouts. The biggest thing going for the game is the very charming characters. Video game junk food, the voice acting, graphics, and characters are great, but the rest is very generic.. I loved the characters in this game and the combat was difficult which is refreshing in today's games. You will be hard pressed to find many action/adventure games in the system that are as good as this game. Played it as part of the Nathan Drake Collection, some parts of the game are good, some are alright and some are absolutely awful. Sadly the awful parts are way too prevalent, like the enemy encounters, combat and Jet ski controls. Of course a lot of it is because it's an early PS3 era game but that does not excuse it's bad use of combat. The good thing is, that the story while somewhat dumb is fun, the VA is good, the platforming is not annoying. I'd give this like a 67 but since it's sitting at 7.9 I'll have to give it a 6.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I recently played the game via the PS4 collection and overall the game is fun and the story is great, my only complaints are the wave runner/jet ski parts which are awful, constantly getting shot at, and Drake running slow like he's always in mud... That being said it's still a fun game with great graphics... : ). Uncharted: Drake's Fortune's mechanics are as weak as its weapons. The weapons get stronger in the second half of the game, the mechanics don't.. The gameplay i like, but everyone else doesnt like it so i wont give it a 10 but the story.. oh the story! Its amazing, the same with set pieces and probably the best, the characters. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Drake's Fortune's gameplay displays great heterogeneity by cycling through shooting, puzzle-solving and adventuring segments to keep the adventure varied and entertaining. However, the quality of the individual elements is mediocre at best: shooting is extremely limited with few weapons, little enemy variety and basic maps, puzzles are awfully bland and adventuring sections boil down to a tedious sequence of buttons presses. The story is serviceable, merely existing to justify the action.. This year, 2023, i decided to play the entire Uncharted series from the beginning, for the first time. Man am I disappointed by the first entry. The puzzles are outright stupid, with Nathan exclaiming ""oh it probably has to do with the symbols"" the moment you enter a room and with the charming but dull adition of Francis Drakes diary which creates the feeling of the developers holding the hard of a slightly **** child and leading this child through tasks that are more similar to matching a cube with its corresponding shaped hole than an actual puzzle for grown people. Platforming is dull. The action is tedious, there is just too much of it and it is so dull and repetitive. The characters and the kind pf stupid but light hearted writing is what gives this game at least some points. This game did not age well... and I dont care. Nothing stopped it from being better.. Great game. I played it recently on PS4 and it is still nice. The story and combat system are very decent.. I remember being hooked and replaying the demo alone. Once I actually purchased the game… We’ll you can guess.. Another great game that broke me away from the COD mindset as a kid, looking back it was a start to one of the best game series out there.. This game can be a lot of fun except when you are shooting and unfortunately this game is 70% shooting.... this game is a masterpiece, soundtrack that matches the game a lot, graphics that as much as it is a 2007 game are beautiful until today, captivating story. The best game I played on ps3. This is my first ps3 game and my first non-JRPG game. As a kid I was very addicted to JRPG games I refused to play anything else. This game not only broke me out of the JRPG loop, but made me fall in love with action games. This game has great voice acting, great writing and a very good action game that was so realistic and shooting all of the bad guys was a lot of fun as well. Its only weakness was how short it was, but aside from that this was a must have game.. I love the Uncharted series and it is probably my favourite game series at all. But I have to say, even though this game is the beginning of the series, it did not age well. Playing it to day can really be a pain sometimes. In terms of story, it´s the typical Uncharted game type, so the story is of course great and fun.. This game was good and when I first picked it up it was because it was not much at the time. It’s a great game but the climbing is not 100% assisted yet for this one allowing you to easily accidentally jump off a ledge plummeting to your doom.. Although I love this game series, the first game is quite mediocre when it comes to the gameplay. An Excellent adventure game that makes you feel like you are in an indiana jones movie although the combat gets pretty boring towards the end.. NAUGHTY DOG is taking firm steps towards becoming the best company of today and in the future, this game is just as perfect as other games.. good game gameplay a bit sloggy really good start for an old franchise loveable character. Naughty Dog demonstrates what they're capable of in this first entry into the Uncharted franchise.. This game is awesome. Definitely outdated but the nostalgia helps a lot. The charming characters such as drake, sully, and elena are amazing, the gameplay doesn't hold up well now but it isn't the worst gameplay ever. It's a good entry into a great series and I recommend it.. Worst game I ever played. Hate rate to this game is immesurable. Boring story. Messed up at 120% game mechanics Level design is bad Shooting is bad Platforming is bad. Played only for the story, but after that I realised - it wasn't worth it. Id better did that on youtube. I just hoped Id like the story more if I suffer through this damn game.. Story: 7/10 Gameplay: 6/10 Graphics: 8/10 Enjoyability: 7/10 Overall: 7/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Feels like you're playing a movie, there are more plot contrivances/conveniences than I would've liked and the characters aren't as good as I was hoping but overall it's a pretty solid story and a lot of really good action set pieces. This game does not hold up at all. Extremely repetitive gameplay, terrible gun play, and never ending annoying missions. The one saving grace of this game was the excellent characters, interesting Indiana Jones-like story, and funny dialogue. I cannot recommend that anybody try this out as a video game. It would be a much better experience to just watch the cutscenes or a let’s play.. Great game with minor flaws. The camera is awful and the enemies are a bit repetitive. A Great Adventure of Game those with Typical Treasure Hunting Tropes is Fast Paced and Slick with a Blend of Shooter and Platform Mechanics and fun Characters. The start of my favorite videogame trilogy of all time. Unfortunately, the gameplay is extremely dated, but it isn't bad. It is still a blast to play.. Uncharted 1: Drake's Fortune .. It's a pretty cool movie game, you feels like you are in a Indiana Jones' movie. But that's it, you gonna have a lot of fun sometimes, but you are goin to watch more than play, in each 10 minutes there is a cutscene, you can clock that if you want.. A fun time overall. Like a good movie that charms you through the tedium with gorgeous moments of kinetic artistry. I played this on PS4 as part of the Drake collection. It's fine- some truly engaging combat and action sequences. At the same time, I suppose I am not the biggest 3rd-person cover shooter fan, so I found that part of the gameplay was not to my tastes so much. Still, other than some laughable (and I assume intentional) plot contrivances and sharp turns in the story, it was enjoyable enough to see thru to the end and had good performances. That being said, after finishing this game, I tried a bit of the sequel, but after 2 years I have yet to finish either of the other 2 games in the Drake collection, nor have I thought about trying the fourth game. Take what you want from that admission.. Uncharted 1 is one of the best games on ps3, it was the beginning of a very successful and incredible series that is known as one of the best exclusives on ps. Uncharted Drake's fortune has a very solid story that has many surprising moments and interesting characters. The gameplay is very good when it came out, but it can still hold up pretty well even with some outdated gameplay mechanics. Furthermore, the pace is very well organized with sections that give suspense to the player, and other related to exploring, shooting and climbing moments. The graphics are awesome, especially for 2007, with various locations like forests and abandoned ruins where the game give its full potential. Of course there are certain sections where there are less details, but it's only a minor problem compared to the rest of the beautiful locations. I recommend it still in 2022!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALER","the controls and especially the camera are janky, the climbing and combat are at their weakest in the series . overall this game is filled to the brim with Jank’ . compared to later games in the series the action is honestly pathetic ."
552.Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas,"Rainbow Six: Vegas does a great job of taking a complex tactical shooter and turning into a game that a wider audience can play.. I loved the online mode of this game, i wish i had more time back then and played it more.. If only Ubisoft kept making R6 games like this one. Absolutely loved this game back in the day.. I actually did not enjoy this game, I thought the level design was bland and the graphics horrific. I wouldn't waste my time on it.. buy fifa 21 because this games ****! the graphics are outdated and don't look anything good unlike fifa 21 which is the madden of graphics. maybe this game could be good if they just copied armed and dangerous for the xbox. After experiencing greatness in the previous entries of the franchise, Vegas lived up to the Rainbow Six name. The campaign was realistic and a lot of fun. Terrorist Hunt was a blast with friends. The competitive multiplayer was one of the best on Xbox 360. This is what the FPS genre is all about. This is a classic.. This game currently has an 8.4 user score on Metacritic, which just goes to show that most Metacritic users have very low standards for games. Some users even gave this turd a 10, which makes me honestly wonder if we played the same game, because the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas I played was such a poorly designed mess that I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Ironically, Microsoft gave this pile of canine fecal matter away to Xbox Live Gold members for free. It's like getting free AIDS. They only give away games that either a) everyone and their mother already has (Like Halo games), or b) nobody in their right mind **** wants (Fable 2). This game falls under the latter category. Now, this game isn't even up to Ubisoft's seemingly non-existent standards. The game is AT LEAST as glitchy as most Ubisoft titles. There are various audio glitches. The textures can sometimes take forever to load in. I've seen enemies stick the muzzle of their gun through a wall, somehow see me with the muzzle of their weapon, and then shoot me. Through a wall. Quality. As for graphics, I think it's safe to say this is the ugliest AAA game to use Unreal Engine 3. They somehow took a decent looking engine and made a game that looks like regurgitated **** chunks. If you look closely you'll see that the rappel rope on your team member's uniform is a FLAT TEXTURE of a rappel rope. Graphics don't really matter to me though, and I try not to factor graphics into my review scores no matter how ugly a game is. The sound design for the game is actually alright, although a bit quirky. It lends itself nicely to the gameplay, as you'll be able to hear random terrorists chit-chatting just around the corner or on the other side of a wall, letting you know that you're about to enter a room full of terrorists. There's a bit of a flaw here too, however. Often times you won't be able to hear enemy gunfire if you're around a corner or they're out of view, despite being literally 5 feet away from you or less. Again, another nitpick. It's not Battlefield, but that's not what you should be expecting. The animation system is one of the parts where this game actually shines. The attention to detail on the weapon reloading animations is superb. All weapons are animated not only in first person, but also third person. Everything from the loading of individual shotgun shells into the magazine tube to loading another box of ammo into your LMG is painstakingly animated and you can tell they put a lot of time and effort into it. You can even see the little details like the magazines being swapped out and thrown on the ground in third person. It's quite amazing and I commend the animators for doing it, and I wish more games had this attention to detail. The AI in this game is probably the worst aspect. Your two AI squadmates are pretty much useless in the game's 'realistic' difficulty setting. You're going to start feeling like you're babysitting them very quickly, and probably fail missions countless times because of them. They stick themselves in front of your crosshairs constantly, block your way constantly, accidentally friendly fire you or their other squadmate (which is an instant fail by the way, even if they shot the other AI squadmate), and generally will make you want to pull your hair out. The terrorist AI, on the other hand, is absolutely lethal. You are the three stooges, whilst the terrorists are basically an army of T-800-esque killing machines. They will kill you by staring at you, and then shoot a couple of bullets where you were standing for good measure. No, I'm not joking, they will actually do this. They'll also stick their gun through a solid wall and shoot you as well. You will die. You will die a lot. Moving on to the gameplay part of the review, which is the real meat of the review, there seems to be a bit of promise. There is some quality here, you can tell that they at least tried. The weapons themselves are pretty standard in terms of function and control. There are various types firearms to choose from, with a selection of attachments for each. There are different pieces of explosives and equipment as well, including a (useless) riot shield. The single player story is literally just a bunch of nonsense that you shouldn't even pay attention to because it makes no sense. The levels are extremely linear and scripted. There is no replayability here, and beating it on Realistic difficulty is more a test of patience than a test of actual skill. The worst part is that the developers, for some reason, forced a checkpoint shortage into the game. This must have been baby's first game development project for the level designers. You will retry certain areas over and over again until the stars align and you make it through, only to die in the next room full of enemies and have to start over again from the beginning because you didn't get a checkpoint. Adversarial is a joke. Co-op Terrorist Hunt is probably the most fun game mode.. The best first person modern military shooter this generation and for one reason only, the terrorist hunt multi-player game mode. With it's excellent AI and level design the terrorist hunt is still challenging even seven years after the game was released and best of all it could be enjoyed split-screen. This is a game me and my friends pick up to play every couple of months, it's a real teamwork building experience (although, Dean, your crap. Sorry but you are dude). The game fails on the 10 for it's single player campaign, although quite enjoyable it didn't really have any memorable moments and it's more the gameplay and room layouts you want to master rather than being gripped by story. Overall a non stop giver **** if you like to play with friends.. Fun game to play, but short story line and limited in what you can do and where you can go. I only played offline, single player so I can't comment on the online or multiple player aspect. Good graphics and sound.. this was the first real shooter for 360. got many awards and also goty editiion. i had 360 and ps3 version. it was my favorite game out of all for the longest duration of years. now that i dont have a copy, im ready for a new copy and miss it. Logan keller was my favorite g.i. joe for hella long. With absolutely perfect combat, an interesting story, an awesome assortment of guns, and arguably the best squad-command-based combat system of all time, ""Rainbow Six Vegas"" rightfully inserts itself into the Tom Clancy game empire.. Great game, a lot options of tactic ,like in a real life ,but lacks graphic and you cant save when you want in singleplayer ONLINE 9/10. Pick this game up for under $2 at Gamestop, it is well worth it. I wasn't expecting much but myself and several friends all decided to buy it. Terrorist mode is fun and it STILL has an online community.. I remember when tom clancy games were great. This game is awesome, a lot of fun in this game, best in the series in my opinion. The graphics, and plot were great and the first person to third person mechanics are amazing. The dev team did a great job on this one.. This is in my top 5 favorite games ever list even now it still plays great sure the single player maybe a little weak but it beats the newer CoD games and battlefield games hands down and the multiplayer is amazing. The single player is quite bad. There's almost no story. But online is where this shines as a tactical shooter. It's so much better multiplayer than RSV2, more fun to play as well. The only real issue is that there's only 1 gun people use: FAMAS 6x scope. But lots of good and fun games have outstanding weapons. In every way, it's gun on gun action. A good player can dominate a bad player regardless of what gun they use. Another issue with this game is major lag at times online.. It is a good game with its features but the gameplay is extremely hard when I started the game the check points where to scarce and the enemy's can take 3 bullets when you can only take one and there is about 20 enemy. If you like fps games and have money to spare you might as well get it but if you want a *{GREAT}* game for your money than this is not the game you want its not a great game but it is good(and i see someone says that the only people who dislike are the ones that are bad at it that is not true. Me and my friend play games to 12:00 at night we play all different shooters and we are not horrible at them. The king of FPS! Where is rsv3? This games owns, single player is crap but online is still the best, beats all cod games to date and battlefield games. It's realistic in damage but is a lot of fun too. Maps are spot on also. I hate ghost recon but I hope ubisoft make another rsv without copying the dead FPS years we have been through. NO KILLSTREAKS NO PISSING ABOUT WITH RESETTING RANKS! just hardcore death matches!. Rainbow 6 Vegas 1&2 are the best Swat team games ever made to date,in my opinion! They're not boring,have planty of action & tension,& yet is quite realistic at the same **** that i mean the tactics you can employ & options available to you,Real life weapons & equipment,& can die quickly if your **** graphics are good,with some great detail,& its great that the game can be played Co-Op online & off via Split-Screen,Though its a pity you dont get the cutscenes & storytelling when you play in Co-Op.Shame.. Which is the only reason this doesnt get a perfect 10.",john sutter: i loved the online mode of this game back in the day . he says the graphics are outdated and don't look anything good . sutter: this game is AT LEAST as glitchy as most Ubisoft titles . sutter: i'd buy fifa 21 because this games ****!
553.Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix,"Pretty good port of the original. Though not nearly as charming. Plays like it should. Good Game!. This beautiful re-creation of SSF II is a great 2D fighting game for both newbies and die-hard fans. Visually, it is a stunner. The new colorful art style looks fantastic and the animation is fluid. I only wish the game contained more modes. As it stands, HD Remix is a real treat for those who enjoyed the original iteration. It captures the classic ""Street Fighter II"" feel perfectly. I would rate it with 9 out of 10.","HD Remix is a great 2D fighting game for both newbies and die-hard fans . as it stands, it captures the classic ""Street Fighter II"" feel perfectly . as it stands, HD Remix is a real treat for those who enjoyed the original iteration ."
554.Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne,"Of my entire life, it's the only game I still play today. Start it when I was 9 Yo, and 19 years later I still play it, Crazy ! The re-playability is huge because you can win battle in so many different ways, creativity, skill and knowledge is rewarded. + custom games made by the community are just games in the game. One of my favorite game and THE game I played the most in my life.. single player campaign is an absolute delight and that is what my score for; the regular multiplayer is a complex mess with too much micro expect for the UMS maps the multi is just not worth it. I assume this to be 1 piece along with the WCIII since the story is completed with this edition. So again, best game ever I have played in my entire life. best story telling, best characters best everything. this story is showing the great brilliance of how to make empathy with the villains. Arthas was right !. Best rts game ever it was like friend to me when I was young I have so many good gmemories how I sank hundreds of hours into it. A great expansion for a greatess RTS, with a lot of new maps, heros, and an addictive campaign.. Better balance than in ""Regin of chaos"" but a little bit worse story. However its still must play if you played ""Regin of chaos""!. Just the perfect expansion following the ""reign of chaos"". This expantion, was the one that completed the Warcraft 3 and made it perfect. Must play.. One of the best and most classic games. I grew up with this game, and it will always have a special place in my heart.. An incredible expansion which expands on everything the game has done in the past for me notably one of the best things that were added is the increased map size of 480x480, later on in 1.29 (the best version of this game) has also increased player count of 24 players in a single map as far as I am aware this one of very few RTS games that allow 24 players playing simultaneously in the same map combined with the map editor and amount of maps readily available it is simply an astonishing RTS game which I find very hard to stop playing even till this day.. One of my favorite strategy games. It's a legendary game. Too bad there's no sequel in this genre.. A perfect expansion. Perfect development of the story and faction. Blizzard finally solves my biggest problem of previous releases: the missions are starting to be demanding.. Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne is a remarkable expansion that builds upon the strengths of its predecessor. With its engaging storyline, new features, refined gameplay, and active multiplayer community, it successfully expands the Warcraft universe and provides countless hours of strategic and immersive gameplay. Whether you're a fan of the Warcraft series or a fan of real-time strategy games in general, The Frozen Throne is a highly recommended addition to your gaming library.. Same as Reigns of Chaos - Story masterpiece and the music and dabing in my native language is 10/10. Best game ever made. Best World Editor that gave birth to multiple billion dollar genres.. Made a near perfect game even better. Expansion to the greatest Warcraft game.. The best strategy game. It has a very interesting story and colours in the game are good. Not to be confused with the Reforged version.. Another masterpiece besides Starcraft, I played many many bot games. FROZEN THRONE is a good update. I love both. The campaign is also great.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Didn't like graphics bad characters bad game very badly done Do not recommend.. Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne is the first and only expansion for the legendary RTS game Warcraft III, being released in 2003. Honestly I do not even really distinguish between Reign of Chaos and The Frozen Throne. To me they just form one brilliant whole. I vividly remember how I waited for TFT release, wishing to see how the story will continue and then how I anxiously waited for the release of the second and third acts of the bonus campaign. Generally the changes from the RoC are not big, there was no reason for that after all. It is just a bit of balance, few added units, one hero, quite a lot of neutral creeps. But the main thing is the continuation of the story. First you get to play for the Night Elves, playing as Maiev Shadowsong following Illidan. I really like the Broken Isles, the mysteries they hold and particularly its large dungeon: The Tomb of Sargeras. Then two interesting missions, where Maiev sends for help and Malfurion with Tyrande arrive. Then another unconventional mission where you help Kael and the remains of the Alliance. Then you stop Illidan in the Ruins of Dalaran and the story twist in the last mission. Then you got the Alliance campaign, relatively short, but probably my favorite. First you repair the observatories and defeat the undead, then Kael is locked in the dungeon and you play one of the coolest missions, the escape for the dungeons of Dalaran. The secret mission is a very cool tower defense. The second part of the campaign takes place in Outland and it is very atmospheric. The last mission in particular is very cool. The last classic campaign is the great finale of the Warcraft story: Legacy of the Damned. Nice touch is reverse leveling of Arthas. First you deal with betrayal in Lordaeron and then Arthas hurries to save the Lich King in Northrend and meanwhile you take control of Sylvanas, who becomes the ruler of the Forsaken. The great finale takes place right beneath the Frozen Throne in an epic battle of Arthas vs. Illidan. The most difficult mission of the entire Warcraft III game and fantastic epic ending of the story. But then you get the Bonus Campaign, in which you play as Rexxar helping Thrall with founding of Durotar. In this campaign there are very little RTS aspect, instead it is an outright RPG, truly it can be considered as the step between W3 and WoW. As I mentioned in the RoC review, so many aspects of this game get used over and over and over in the endless World of Warcraft story. The Horde and the Alliance, the visuals of Outland and Northrend, the great variety of neutral mobs, the abilities, the items, the characters, the story. I cannot stress enough how great this game was and how much they are still trying to reap the fruits of this outburst of genius. No microtransaction and no SJW, obviously. This is how you make a great expansion, this game became legendary and rightly so. I keep coming back to this game and I still do not have enough. They do not make games like this anymore. Final Verdict: 97%. The game has best story in all games i played. I love this game campaigns...... Pure masterpiece.Cant compare to any other game.Different league brillance and ever gold.. Best PC game i've ever played so far. Since my childhood and my aduldhood. I still have the game on my pc and play the campaign on in a while.. Expansion is on the same level as stand-alone title. Great addition, Campaign from Arthas's perspective is something we needed.. An amazing game, one of the best I've ever played, the expansion was very entertaining, I'm glad they added new units and abilities, I've been playing the game since 2010, I honestly never thought I'd like a game so much, one of the best RTS I've ever played I never, ever regret buying the disk and installing it, wonderful from my perspective. A true game changer. Passionate campaign, awesome multiplayer, and crazy powerful map creator.. Best game I have ever played Best game I have ever played Best game I have ever played. Played it with my ex, played it with my best friend, played it with my roommates.. The Frozen Throne provides gamers with a vast new chapter in the epic Warcraft saga. In the single-player campaign, players revisit the war-torn world of Azeroth. Several months have passed since Archimonde and the Burning Legion were defeated at the battle of Mount Hyjal, yet a new threat has arisen throughout the land. One new Hero per race, each possessing powerful spells and magical abilities. A host of new units, each equipped with new abilities and spells, giving players the opportunity to create diverse strategic and tactical forms of combat. Player-built shops, unique for each race, equipped with items carefully designed to improve and aid the units of every race. Neutral Heroes, available for recruitment by all players, that can supplement and strengthen a player's army with all new spells and abilities. Expanded multiplayer options over **** including multiple new game types, clan and tournament support. [Blizzard]. Gameplay 100% Characters 80% Story 90% Visual 90% Music 90% Feeling 100% 90%. high quality and interesting very nice game if I need to compare among all other games by the way. A great story of one of the most iconic characters in gaming history. Perfection.. The 2003 game that is still the most alive of all is a bunch of different maps from the community. Best game known to mankind. Sadly blizzard delete it for all of us and future generations will not have the chance to expierience the best game ever created. Fu*k you blizzard, i pray you go bankrupt.. A good RTS game with a decent campaign. It still has active E-sport players. Its world-editor is a powerful tool which made it possible for the community to create a lot of content for example DotA.. its warcraft . . .. This expansion, completes the story of the fallen prince leading him to became ""ONE"" with the Lich King. One of the best stroy telling in its Genre with an amazing story, Fro. Been playing it since 2006. One of the greatest games of all time and a masterpiece.. Truly legendary game. Everything is good here: history, gameplay, graphics (for 2003). But, unfortunately, there are problems with this game on new systems. I would like to re-release this game (not the one released by Blizzard).. a classic! the story is amazing, the whole campaign is really fun to play through and I also love how it isn't just RTS but many of the levels (and the whole Rexxar campaign) mix a lot of RPG elements in, the easter eggs in the campaigns are also really fun to look for. besides that what makes the game this good is the map editor. the editor is really fun to mess with but also you can create a lot of mini games, and the mini games is what truly makes the game. all from TD to Jurassic Park to whole MMO maps, think of anything and it'll probably be a WarCraft III mini game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Almost feel bad for giving 9 instead of 10. But the lore very good, campaigns funny, the acting, style of animation is good. Melee games is so so but the world editor is the killer that made this game stand the test of time above all. 9,5 out of 10 imo.. this expansion was quite good, adding new heroes, units and a good scenario, a shame that the naga race didn't become a playable race outside the campaign. the last cinematic with the final duel was quite a disappointment. Well, it’s the add-on to the best game ever, so it get a 10 too obviously. The game still has a great community as displayed by back2warcraft and w3champions. Also don’t forget TFT custom games popularized the mobas and tower defense genres.. One year after the release of Warcraft III, the Add-On called The Frozen Throne was published. And Blizzard does everything right here. It has so much content, that it´s more a sequel than an expansion. I´ve played about 70 hours and would start all over again. Just like in the original, gameplay, controls, setting and story are unsurpassed. The quests are a bit more challenging but always fair fun. If you enjoyed Reign Of Chaos, you should definitely get The Frozen Throne!. My first ever game on PC! It was an epic introduction into Warcraft world. Best RTS game of all time.. It was a very decent extension to the original Warcraft III. It added just enough to keep you engaged, but most important was the plot! The story was epic and hence the rather high score for this game.. Perfect expansion for phenomenal game. After so many year, for me it's unthinkable to play without it.. One of the best RTS games ever made. I played it as a kid and the story made my head spin, it was an awesome experience.. Better than ROC, the story is really engaging and well paced, characters have very gray morality, theyre not ""le good gois who are going to save the world from le ebil bad gois"", they're people caught in predicaments. Every character, even the no name archer or grunt has so much personality, they are dripping with history. Not enough cinematics, the ones that exist leave me yearning for more, the first cinematic feels like a cliffhanger that isnt properly explained in the level. Custom game is a lot better balanced than ROC, hero system is still janked, gameplay could be better, its not really "" war""craft, more like Diablo with base building and autoattack, (i need muh big armies) maps are always tiny, lots of noncannon gameplay elements that are annoying like reviving heroes. Combat and movement animations are awful, every other animation is great for some reason. I'm still upset that Gary got mind ****, betrayed and then eaten by ghouls, its a very dark story behind the colorful artstyle, you do in fact play as a bad guy in most cases, or just tragedies like kaelthas or maive, W.O.W really ruined the lore, War3 was the peak of Warcraft.. The beautiful volvo of your life and your life and your life will always be the way to be the best of your life as a whole foods are not a good idea on your diet plan for your diet or your own project is not the best and you can. Great single player story and level design. Competitive fun rts, with custom mode. You could play literally any genre in this game, it comes to your mind, even fps! It had hundreds of thousands players on custom servers! Great mapmakers made dota, which was than copied by Valve. I bet they didn't get anything... Blizzard was afterwards salty, but blizzard dropped to level of EA, they deserve it!. The best real-time strategy game I ever played. And community will not this game die.. One of the best games, with amazing gameplay, voice acting, plot and a large platform for creating custom games.. Initially I did not like this as much as starcraft, but it grew on me and now I consider it the definitive real-time strategy experience. The heroes make it more engaging, and smaller armies make the game more manageable and more varied It also spawned the moba genre through Dota and the tower defense genre so it has that going for it too.. This is one of the best game expansion. Like it's predecessors this is the last RTS Warcraft the Blizzard will produce and what a way to end this game with a great cinematic at the end.. Played on PC. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue: GREAT.. This is a game of my childhood. And I would love to go through it another 1000 times. After all, this is a game of a once great company.. The best game of all time. Please vote here 10/10. I would really like to see Frozen Throne on top of the list and Reforged on the bottom ... And really I believe that's where their real spot should be. Reforged is disgraceful shame for Blizzard ... Attempt to destroy the best game ever made.. Warcraft3 TFT IS The great expansion To WC3. Played it For data online & offline!. One of the best games ever made in history. It (was) a masterpiece. Working from Linux,A pple OSX, Windows XP to Windows 10. Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne & Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos tell the Story of WarCraft equal to the Books Warcraft: War of the Ancients Triology. The story is great and takes u away into the world of warcraft. The Multiplayer offers so many possibilities with the community created maps. But also competitive strategy gameplay in 1vs1 up to 4vs4 games where u build a base get a hero and units and clutch your enemy. And remember DotA, LoL and all other similar games came from players/creators of WarCraft 3 maps.. best game ever after all learing script and creating own spell with World Editor. sadly with new reforged rule, i cannot do that again :(. i love using anime character with Tichondrius voice set xD. THE best game ever made. Give us the original back, Blizzard. What you've done by forcing us to take the downgraded version is beyond my intelligence but I hope you listen to the people.. Rest in Peace under Reforged version... This game in my heart forever - never forgive Activision Blizzard. THE game of my childhood, it was the best RTS i have ever played. It WAS, because Blizzard has officially killed this game, by releasing a forced patch in 2020, limiting the game functionality so it can fit Reforged. Rest in Peace Warcraft 3, 2002-2020 - killed by Blizzard itself.. When people screamed this ruined my favorite game I did not think they meant that you can no longer play Warcraft 3 frozen throne online at all. You cannot play Wc3 anymore without buying reforged. I have been playing Wc3 custom maps multiple times a week for many years now I can not even login. Just wow...... This is my favorite game of all time! The campaign is great, the melee mode is great and the custom games are great. I followed the competitive melee scene for over 10 years.. Wonderful game. One of the best in its genre. Immortal. Not obsolete. A game that will be relevant always.. The community of this game made this game immortal thanks to many years of work on creating maps.. One of the best RTS out there. The story is incredible, it has a special Rexxar campaign for more RPG fun and a lot of custom game types.. This used to be the best game ever, but sadly it's unplayable now since WC3 Reforged. Great Game. I hope one day we are allowed to play it again. Damn Reforged to Hell.. This in combination with WarCraft III:Reign of Chaos is (beside Half-Life2) the best PC Game ever (regarding the release time) and a true masterpeice. The expic single player campaign, the never again reached multuiplayer (beside Fifa, Counterstrike an Starcraft the only game, which was always in the gamepool of the World Cyber Games) in B-NET and tha mass creativity in the custom maps universe inside are way over the top! What a pity they ruined it with the REFORGED release (hopefully the fix all the bugs, polish the game and add all the promosed features - I WANT MY 1500 WIN PICS BACK!!!). The best RTS campaign, and incredible multiplayer with countless custom games.. Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne was made in a time where expansion sets were full games with an entire campaign rather than today's games where single missions or less than five hour DLC's are considered, ""extra content"". It was also made in a time where thought, passion and love for the games universe was shown in the story, again, as opposed to the cash-grabs a lot of today's hollow expansions and DLC's are known for. Meaning that the hours of content this expansion set brings is well worth the purchase on its own merit, let alone the fact that it is a genuinely well made game. The continuation of the story from Reign of Chaos is brilliantly written and expanded on creatively, the new characters introduced are welcomed additions that are unique to the story and don't overshadow the characters from the previous installment and has a wonderful ending to a rollercoaster of a campaign. The multiplayer adds new maps, map mechanics and builds on the groundwork already laid in the base game. It is a great experience for anyone who has a passion for fantasy, the RTS genre or a well written story.. The best, simply the best. One of the best RTS game even if you put it in the year 2020.. 10/10 loved this old game but now im just paying homage to its memory. It is now lost to time and is just a faint memory of those who loved it.. I feel sorry for this deleted game, it was one of the best game it have ever played. The time spending playing custom games and campaign were the best.. Legendary game which was RIP in 28 Jan 2020 Activision Blizzard Split on your faces comrades. a true addition to the classic nearing perfection, it is not possible for any human team of developers to make a better addition to a game. A memory to be cherished and preserved.. The best game ever made! I have played the singleplayer campaign maybe 10 times. Thousands and thousands of hours online playing custom maps such as LOTR maps, different tower defense maps, island defense, all kinds of zombie maps, azeroth wars etc.. Game crashes my computer after new update. Great job blizzard. You destroyed a game ive played all of my life and loved playing. The trust built up for years is now destroyed.. An amazing game made by awesome people. Even though the graphics are old, they were so passionately well made that - overall - the game far exceeds 2020's games especially in terms of intelligent gameplay. Nowadays, video games require that you control a character and move it around by spamming one click and maybe pressing three keyboard buttons. No, no no. This game requires you to control multiple units and be aware of tons of hotkeys in order to multitask efficiently in a timely manner and force defeat upon the enemy through methodology, consistency and strategy. Easily 10/10. One of the best games ever made, and one of my favourit games of all time. Even now I am more than happy to play it. The campaign is fun and has a pretty good story, and the custom games are amazing and making this masterpiece timeless.. Greatest game of all time. I only wish I could still play it, but Bobby Kotick has decided that it was not bringing enough money for himself and the shareholders so he shut it down.. I spent a lot of time playing this game during my childhood everything is fun, i really Recommending.. The newest blunder that is reforged reminded me how perfect tft is and was.. A greater contribution to Warcraft lore than the entirety of World of Warcraft has done in 13 years, gameplay that revolutionized RTS games that we have today, plenty of skill to learn and improve on, and the greatest custom game community I've witnessed in gaming. There's thousands of hours of gameplay spread across many interests a player may have. This game is so incredible, that an attempt to remake it 15 years later is not as wonderful as this.. The best RTS game I've ever had the pleasure of playing. I still keep the Reign of Chaos and Frozen Throne CD's and it's my go to game to play when I want to enjoy a blast from the past. You can download and play a ton of user made maps and campaign adding hundreds of hours of great and unique gameplay. If i had to recommend someone a RTS to play it'd be this one hands down.. Literally one of the best games - no, forms of entertainment - in HISTORY. I learned to read and write on this game, at the age of 4. It was my childhood and I still play it to this day. The graphics were really advanced and pioneered into the 3D RTS formula. It has four races with completely different models, cultures, audio, balance. Unlike Warlords Battlecry, the RPG elements blend with the RTS ones and not the other way around. The story is wonderful, full of secrets and evil schemes, epic heroes and you really feel like you're preventing the Armageddon with every step and mission. The melee games are incredible: no match is ever the same, since the items dropped by creeps are random, you can have one or three heroes ,etc. But the best thing of this all is the editor: a powerful development tool that allows you to create any game with no programming knowledge. Thanks to this editor, brilliant minds invented stuff like DotA, which became DotA 2 and League of Legends.. The great DLC of the same great quality game. Just play it and you will understandm why everyone love/hate Lich King/Sylvana and etc.. Best game of all time by far, it's literally impossible to get bored, there's an infinite potential of new experiences thanks to custom maps and mapmakers. So many wonders came out of this game, it would still be that way if Blizzard didn't change for the worse and utterly destroyed it after the Reforged release. Now it is impossible to play this game officially after Reforged came out since the servers are gone, but one can only hope Blizzard will do something about that and bring it back one way or another.. Best RTS of all time, great World Editor that gave birth to many great custom maps and even new games or genres.. A great full complement to a great game. New units, a new plot, awesome custom games! Awesome voice acting in my native Russian language.. One of the best game I've ever played so many childhood memories thank you tft. I bought this game in 2019 and its incedible, after all years, this game have a excellent campagin, soundtrack, multiplayer this game have all. For me this is the best game ever **** Blizzard is destroy this beautiful game with reforged.. Warcraft reforged is trash, but we won't forget this work of art, thanks for all old blizzard, the new one is not you anymore. Made by a team that gave a **** once upon a time. How times have changed. I could never not recommend this game.. This game was my childhood. Every day after school (if my parents let me) I'd play this game. I didn't have much friends as a child and this game really saved me. It's really a shame to see what blizzard did to it.... One of the best RTSes ever made. New game genres were even spawned from it such as Dota.. That game is a masterpiece. Though the Original one was better due to the Plot comparison. But the gameplay itself was more polished that in Reign. And now we've lost it, after all these years. Good night, sweet Prince.. One of the best games ever to be made. Even if I prefer the more macro heavy playstyle of other real-time strategy games, because of how the editor of this game works and what you can do with it makes this game not only contain a campaign or its intended RTS style gameplay, but gave birth to thousands of games inside of it. Some of them include version of Mario Party, Tower Defense and probably the most known of them all: DOTA.. one of best games ever. shame blizzard ruined it with reforge huge shame :(. Simply a masterpiece. I grew up with this game. It is not only a great game, it is part of me as a person.. Best game campaign i ever player,phenomenal in every aspect, excelent characters and gameplay. One of the best games ever made in 2000, it made a lot of great improvements of the first games mechanics, and as always has the same Blizzard formula that made Starcraft great. The new units and heroes are alright, and some of them improve some of their factions short comings. The story is quite moving, but the ending isn't what you'd expect, but if you know Blizzard you would know why its made that way. Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne was an absolute masterpiece ****, both in storytelling and entertainment. The multiplayer experience is something i cherish even to this day, february 2020. Who could have thought that games like this one are a one-in-a decade marvel.. Best RTS game ever, however it got deleted from the developers in 2020. Good new here: A pirated version can still be played locally and on LAN party. There might even be a 3rd party service for online multi-player.. This game is so great, spent thousands of hours playing vustom maps. Most of those hours went towards dota !. The best game in the two decade. better than crap the reforged The beat campaigns. This was a generation defining game. Hours before Reforged launched, it was still a staple of the genre. I'd pay the original asking price again just to go back to the original version.. This was an absolutely beautiful game that still held up every time I went back to it over the years. I'll never forget the times I spent on ****. Warcraft 3, This is an example ****, where timeless design shines. The Gameplay still holds up even 17 years after release and the vivid Modding community kept this game alife. Ofcourse the Story is another Point where this game shines. Even the German voiceactors sound good, which is a rarity. From the Top of my head, I can recite lines that stuck with me for years. (German) ""Ihr habt eure Männer belogen und die Söldner veraten die für euch gekämpft haben! Was ist mit euch los Arthas?"" ""In dieser Urne liegt die Asche eures Vaters Arthas. Wollt ihr sie ein letztes mal schänden bevor ihr sein Königreich dem Verfall überlasst?"" (/German) This is the Game that spawned Dota, where People fought each other in Battletanks and where Tournaments still excite people years after. Warcraft 3 is what Starcraft Broodwar is to the Starcraft series. A timeless classic, that will allways be remembered with adoration.. In addition to revolutionizing the gaming industry, Warcraft III has been a pillar in the international gaming community, playing a significant part in ushering in the dawn of e-sports, fostering an incredibly productive and lasting modding community and being responsible for the creation of not only the world's most popular MMO with World of Warcraft but also spawning entire genres such as Dota and League of Legends. Its diaspora is heard and felt across the internet all the way down to flash games and fan art communities. I couldn't possibly write a more stellar review. This is game is an example of excellency and majesty to be considered as crucial learning for game designers even in 2020 and a must play for any RTS gamer.. Once I saw a cut scene of this game, I was caught. Just be caught for no reason. I had played this game for nearly 5 years. Almost all of the time after class, I was immersed in this game, competing with other players. Keep on fighting, no matter how many times you lose, and finally you can improve your skill again and again. I enjoyed this process very very much, but only when I was young. The pressure of you life as an adult makes it extremely difficult and tired to face the challenge with others. I retired, but the happy memories will remain in all days to come.. As good as it gets with RTS games, or games in general. Infinitely engaging gameplay, with 4 distinct races, tons of options. Excelent campaigns, and infinite possibilities with the world creator. What are you waiting for?. EPIC!!! Just epic. What else it there to right about this legendary RTS game.. This is a game of my childhood, very cool. It was very interesting to play it, although I played badly. There are also a large number of different mods.. One of the best games ever! I really enjoy music and sounds of it. Polish version is just pure gold. Campaign is interasting and 4 races are pretty balanced. And this game inspired another game (DOTA) that will inspire other game (LOL). Overall pretty good game except for graphics.. Thanks to the Blizzard for this creation, I damn love Warcraft's universe and its history.. Pretty good DLC which extents the story and tells us about fight between biggest badasses Illidan and Arthas. Really good DLC yet cant climb to the quality of original Warcraft.. I've played this game many years ago. But it's the best game of my childhood.. 10/10 must play. Like Age of Empires II mixed with better graphics, more creativity, online clans and forums and LOADS of brilliant mini games that are just as good.. In the game is perfect everything. It is graphic, gameplay, compaign, multiplayer. The Frozen Throne takes the best of Warcraft 3 and makes it better. Even by today's standards, this game is just phenomenal. I can still remember playing this game in the hardest difficulty setting so many years ago and constantly screaming at the unfair computer AI in the SP campaign where they mine gold and only 1 Gold is deducted from their mine whereas your mines will always lose 10 Gold regardless of the upkeep. Despite this though, the games was such an experience to behold with Arthas becoming the Lich King and everything else going to hell. The characters were all memorable and I can still remember Sylvannas, Furion, Kael, Ill","a great expansion for a greatess RTS, with a lot of new maps, heros, and an addictive campaign . the single player campaign is an absolute delight and that is what my score for . i grew up with this game, and it will always have a special place in my heart ."
555.Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis,"I have so much fun every time I play this game. Everything about it, from the story to the gameplay, is just amazing. I enjoyed every moment while playing this game. Turn-based combat strategy that looks and plays exactly like Final Fantasy Tactics but with more of a driving narrative. If you liked FFT, you will like this too.. 20 years have gone by since it's release and it's still the best tactical rpg i've ever **** i play a lot of them.. Simply the best turned based strategy game for gba, the last boss is unforgettable even tho i've played it a while ago, Atlus games are so much fun.. This is a great game, with an interesting story and fun turn-based tactical gameplay. It's hard not to compare it with Final Fantasy Tactics Advance as the two share strikingly similar visuals. The recruiting system is also quite interesting and class systems require certain accomplishments of the unit to qualify.. I played this game a while ago but I remember enjoying the living hell out of it. It is a gem of the gba library do yourself a favor and play this game.. This game is a must have for people who are in love with turn-based strategy games like myself. The gameplay is very unique and has a lot of strategy elements in it: terrain, elements, different classes, weather, etc. The story is also very interesting which is consistent with the Tactics Ogre franchise. Difficulty wise, i think the game is fair - until you spend a lot of time grinding in the training mode which can be repeated infinitely - then the game becomes a cakewalk. The game also allows the player to pick different routes which lead to alternate endings which increases the game's replayability. I have recently purchased the Tactics Ogre game for PSP, which is a remake of the original because of my love for this game. I am sad that these type of games don't have a much of a place on consoles anymore because of a niche market - but I am happy that Atlus continues to develop these games. (Overall 9+ - battle is a bit slow paced, animations are a bit slow)",the game is a must have for people who are in love with turn-based strategy games like myself . it's hard not to compare it with Final Fantasy Tactics Advance as the two share strikingly similar visuals . the recruiting system is also quite interesting and class systems require certain accomplishments of the unit to qualify .
556.Starcraft,"The old game is as good as ever. The newly added keyboard shortcuts are amazing as it reduces tue time it takes to choose soldiers, upgrades and constructions by 50% and allows to stand your ground in a more efficient way when the opponent attacks. The storyline is made even more interesting as it was with the wings of Liberty quest, the heart of the swarm gives great understanding of the Zerg race and the legacy of the void is a great temporary ending to the Starcraft storyline..

I know this game is old. But I think it's a bad thing not to improve just for old users.. Great realtime strategy for all times!. best game of its time. A landmark of the RTS genre, as solid as the best strategy games with variable mechanics according to faction. ""Starcraft"" is just something else – a game that comes packed with an incredible story, a world that's nothing short of beautiful, and characters that really hit the mark. It's safe to say this game didn't just set trends; it flat out revolutionized the RTS genre. And can you believe it? It even skyrocketed to the status of a national sport in Korea. That's some serious impact!. The game that I played when I was in elementary school. The game kind of introduced me to a new world of the real-time strategy genre. I also knew that I am really bad at it but still I loved to play it with my friends.. Replayed it so many times, extremely good gameplay and story. The characters were well written with great voice acting, the world building and universe was super compelling so I'd always want to learn more about it. The story was full of plot twists, sacrifices and fairly complex war situations. The animations for units and buildings were inventive and really fun to look at as well as the unique designs for each race. The soundtrack was a banger and it really fit each faction like a glove. Every faction was unique in philosophy, military strategy and had relatable characters that had me fully invested in them, including the ones you would normally consider ""evil"". Messed around in scenario mode for hours on end, which offered a great deal of extra gameplay options and experimentation. Incredibly fun. Modded custom game modes added a lot as well to the game. Hard to find weak points, this game was a masterpiece. One of the few games ever made that I can unironically consider to be perfect. The multiplayer especially, this game has given birth to E-Sports in Korea, was played for well over 2 decades and it only had ONE big balance patch in ’99 and a small one in 2001. In 20 **** years. New strategies and counters to popular ones were found even after a decade of playing. CONS: Small issues like pathing for some units Arguably the higher focus on micro management due to unit control limitations can be seen as tedious, separating it from other RTS's at the time. Fun and challangeing gameplay, good music, EXCELLENT sound design, interesting story, and a bit of nostalgia!. The legendary game, one of the founders of RTS in the world. Gorgeous plot, interesting concept, beautiful graphics for those years. Legends are created from this game, and it has become a cult. The only and main drawback is the very high complexity. Especially in the company of protoss. 10 - Masterpiece 9 - Amazing 8 - Great 7 - Good 6 - Okay 5 - Mediocre 4 - Bad 3 - Awful 2 - Painful 1 - Unbearable. I really wanted to like it, but I rather just play a board game or Xcom. If I want some type of strategy.. Simply put, Starcraft is the finest game ever to be made. People have literally died from playing too much Starcraft. It essentially created eSports. It popularized RTS (real-time strategy) games. The balanced asymmetry was truly a unique feature, one that has been difficult for other studios to emulate. The use-map settings created an incubator in which entire genres of games were… Expand. Played it for the first time when I had my computer class at school, only to show how rebellious I was.. Good, played years ago but not my kind. My kind of strategy games are more with automations and programmable AI. Commanding all units lot of places on the map realtime is rather for masochists.. I really liked the game. My favorite game from the games of those years, along with Warcraft on an equal footing.. Best RTS of all time. The fast pace and offensive-rewarding game style as well as amazing balance hasn't been successfully replicated in any RTS I know of.. best strategy. I really love this game. I love all the starcraft world. I love the plot.. legend RTS legendary game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. I grew up on this game and it has amazing childhood memories for me. Some of the Blizzard cinematics and story was my favorite growing up. My fav game of its type combining aoe style growth and c+c war tactics. The keyboard shortcuts are your friend use them. The distinctive races, units, spell abilities, and bases are all unique and clever, so it's amazing that the game is as well balanced as it is.. One of those rare games that is not overly complex, but provides a challenging and fun gaming experience. It never seems to get old or boring.. I played the heck out of this back in the day. There might be others that do it better now but this one certainly set the bar pretty high for years.. best rts out there. 10/10. played it for so long. with friends on ""hamachi"" just love it.. In 2021 I am writing reviews for the best games that I ever played. This is one of them, and I played it a lot.. I can't be objective here, because this is my first ever strategy played, and years by years, strategy was my favorite genre. And my eyes still burn when i see this old beautiful game. My personal best ever game for life.. The original version of StarCraft is an excellent example **** of emergence. StarCraft helped define the real-time strategy genre. Like Civilization, the individual game elements are fairly simple, but there are many interrelationships among them, setting up a system of game mechanics that has many interesting emergent properties. During the single-player campaign, you play through 30 missions, which nearly all have you build a base, manage your resources, and construct and upgrade an attack force before obliterating your opponents. The progression within a single StarCraft level is almost always the same, and because it is predictable, a given level does not feel very storylike. StarCraft also tells a story around the levels. In many ways, it is a good example of storytelling in games, with a narrative that is more dramatic than most games of its time. In fact, its storyline follows a structure similar to a classical tragedy, which is definitely rare in games. However, the story is only a framing device around the core gameplay. The player’s performance and choices have no impact on the plot, apart from the fact that the player must complete missions to advance the story. The story provides context and motivation for the game but is not an integrated part of the gameplay.. The best strategy game ever imo. Great battles, competitive possibilities and requires much practice/skill. Graphics are great for its time. I don't have much negative to say about this classic.. This game is one of the best games that I have ever played. I give it a 10 because of the RTS Gameplay, and That this is just pure fun to play- sad that blizzard **** now.. This game is a master piece, thanks to Starcraft today the eSports exists. It´s, year 2020 and I´m still playing SC.. Played on PC. Gameplay: GOOD. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue: GREAT.. A must play for RTS fans. You get three great campaigns, with three unique races, an extremely smooth and simple interface, and an economy an combat system that is so good that it set the standard for all RTS games that came after it. It's still played online competitively and while it's showing it's age these days, you can't deny Starcraft was the game that really put this genre on the map.. Best RTS ever made, good and interesting story, good balance, unique races, enough said.. Amazing game loved it for many years. To this very day is still a favorite. Blizzard in their prime Great times! The Custom games were game flatteringly fun.. Even though more then 20 years passed, I still remember my first expirience in this game, and it was overwhelming. Great story, awesome & atmosperic music, strong and unusual characters, unexpected plot twists, hard missions, instresting units & strategies. Ah, those days when Blizzard actually cared about quality of their games!. This Game is a Milestone in real Time Strategy. Three total different and perfectly balanced Races. A real good Story, that has a perfect cold Space Mood. Good Mission Design, good Sound and Music Design. A really Fun Map Editor (spend more Time in this one than in the Game itself). It has not a ""forced Epicness"", no foreseeing and not an ""good Overmind"", thats what the second one just made bad. The Queen of Blades is one of the most to be hated Villian ever.. This is exactly the game that can be called one of the pillars of the gaming industry. A ""masterpiece of gaming art"" with a very interesting plot and a deep atmosphere. Everything was great in this game for its time. So why I didn’t give it rating 10? ...Because if this rating and review is precisely about my taste, then I cannot note that I did not like the appearance of the game. I play different indie games, so the graphics is not in the first place for me, but it is part of my taste and those indie projects that I like, graphically well done too in theirs way. So, I did not like the style of this game.. Okay, docking marks because a game isn't groundbreaking or pioneering a new genre is ridiculous... If that were the case, everything save a few games would have lowered marks. You need to see it for what it is, and as has been said a couple times, it really is a complex game with alot of thought behind everything you do. To be amazing at it isn't simple, and I think that counts for something.. This is one of my all time favorites. one of the best RTS games out there.. One of those rare games that is not overly complex, but provides a challenging and fun gaming experience. It never seems to get old or boring.. Great game, love the artwork, storyline, grit and everything else this game has to offer. I wish blizzard would revist why starcraft 1 was so much better than starcraft 2, and diablo 1-2 were so much better than diablo 3. It seems blizzard drops the ball on franchises as time goes by. Maybe its time to fire who is in charge. Give us some good products like these blizzard.. As close to perfect as anybody can make, StarCraft is the legacy Blizzard has long since tried to replicate. Three balanced races, a stunning single-player story and endless LAN potential make this the definitive RTS. In fact, it's fair to say that it's the only game of the genre that survived the DOTA map in WarCraft III that caused a transition from RTS to MOBA. The game has just been re-released and it is as compelling as ever - a game that is unmatched before or since.. Starcraft, as almost anyone who grew up playing it will tell you, is one of the most important RTS games of all time. In this reviewers opinion, it is one of the best and most important games of all time across any genre, or platform. And what modern gamers need to understand, is that discussing Starcraft in this way is a bit like trying to explain to young boxing fans why fighters like Floyd Mayweather Jr would never stand a chance against legends like Rocky Marciano from the past. The reason is simply that games like this one were successful in a time where the competition was intense. In the 90's, gaming graphics were overall still pretty terrible. 3D gaming was limited in its capabilities, and still mostly relegated to the FPS genre. As a result, the decade produced some of the finest RTS games to have ever been designed before or since. Games like those in the Civilization franchises, the Red Alert Franchise, Warcraft, and others all were incredibly popular, and innovative for the time. So when I describe Starcraft as the king of RTS, I say that will the weight of a champion who has bested not only its peers of the day, but those who are considered among the best that have ever been. Frankly, this game is 20 years old, and I feel a review on the nature of its play is virtually irrelevant at this point. But I will say that despite its age, it continues to feel enjoyable to play even now. The greatest bulk of this game's design was in the replayability factor. It's simply off the charts. It is still played around the world to this day, professionally and there is ample reason why. As a young gamer, I knew what Starcraft was. Starcraft was the modern day Chess...except there were 3 unique armies, instead of one. In this way, and on a cubic scale, Starcraft will continue to be important in the same way Chess has been for centuries, for years to come. It's no coincidence that the re-mastered edition has only just come out, and in time I predict we will see that that release is just the first of many re-releases of what is unequivocally the best RTS ever made. Why do I keep saying that? Its re-playable, yes. But why? Simple. It's the most balanced game to ever be built. In any game system, in any genre, anywhere across time, you will see flaws in any system wherein differing groups are sent to face one another. Whether you look at games like Street Fighter or Tekken, or others like Call of Duty or even any given pinball machine, there will always be an *optimal* approach, race, character, or design which is simply superior to all others in the game. Inevitably, the game becomes more of a competition of who is the best at using that particular configuration to win. But Starcraft proved that games *could* be made which lacked this fatal flaw. While many players on the professional level seem to believe that the Zerg race offers an overall slight edge, this may be more about the likely psychological preferences of the kinds of players who are the best in the world, rather than a true edge inherent in that species. Moreover, outside the realm of top 1% of professional gamers, the rest of us will gladly be able to enjoy a seamlessly perfect warfare, with each race inhabiting unique advantages and challenges to overcome, as well as intricate and various means by which to counter any given enemy assault or defense. In spite of all the complexities the game offers though, the end result is the same: A simple to pick up, difficult to master, masterpiece of RTS perfection which will forever be the yard stick by which its successors will be measured. As a fan of all races, but one who's heart will forever belong to the mighty Terrans, I will finish off this review with a ""Shields up, weapons online!"" ""Awwww yeah!"". Definetely one of the best RTS's ever, right next to Warcraft III in my opinion. Campaign is great, a lot of missions, great storyline, only the voice-acting seemed a bit off for me, but overall it was grat. And what to say about multi-player... this is the definition of competitive gaming, if you want high level competition it won't get any better than with this game, at least back in the day, don't know how it's like nowadays.. Man. i love this game. And i am not even an RTS fan :)) can't say enough about this classic. Play it, play it, plat it! Yes. i know it's 2016. PLAY IT! :)). Starcraft is undoubtedly the best Real Time Strategy series ever made. There is no RTS game which can match the Starcraft series in any term, from storytelling, to creativity or gameplay. The most considerable characteristic in Starcraft is the unmatched complexity and diversity between the races/factions which no RTS game before could reach or ever will. But even such an excellent game has minor flaws such as the ridiculously stupid pathfinding, which was pretty normal back in the 1990's, but still is very annoying when units block each other and some units don't find their assigned destination at all.. One of the best RTS games of all time. Three unique races, great story, graphics which I think look good if not great, beautiful music which really fits the world. Great campaign with interesting missions.. Well, we have an RTS that people still playing since 1998 (even after Starcraft II). It popularized RTS and invented the e-Sports category because of its unique balanced asymmetric factions. I grew up with this game, the online is perfect but the LAN is the most enjoyable multiplayer with friends in cyber-coffee or at our homes, the map editor gave thousands of additional hours of fun!. One of the best RTS in existance, and only one of three RTS I was able to finish without any cheat codes. Challenging, yet playable, unlike the expansion.. On of the Best of not the BEST RTS game ever made. Revolutionary. This was in an age when developers produced high quality games and before publishers turned into greedy **** they are today.. Starcraft is generally considered to be the greatest RTS games of all time, along with its sister, Warcraft 3. Starcraft left a lasting impact on gaming. During this time period - the golden age of games - we saw the rise of online competitive play. Starcraft single handidly took over an entire country (Korea) to become an actual e-sport, and with Unreal Tournament (online competitive FPS) helped spawn an entire new sporting industry. Starcraft helped catapult **** to THE place to go for online gaming at the time. The visuals, music, gameplay and story is masterfully done. Blizzard during the late 90's was unstoppable. This, Warcraft 2 and 3, and Diablo. Starcraft is considered to be the pinnacle of pure RTS gameplay. There are other titles out there (most notably Command and Conquer) but Starcraft stands head and shoulders above the rest. I personally have played much more WC3 than Starcraft, but I have immense respect for the game and recognize it's accomplishments. Anything less than a 10/10 is a travesty for this game. This is all that needs to be said.. Simply put, Starcraft is the finest game ever to be made. People have literally died from playing too much Starcraft. It essentially created eSports. It popularized RTS (real-time strategy) games. The balanced asymmetry was truly a unique feature, one that has been difficult for other studios to emulate. The use-map settings created an incubator in which entire genres of games were produced. Starcraft is the father of modern gaming.. Starcraft is a challenging yet fun-to-play Real Time Strategy game. It is especially enjoyable when playing the multiplayer with friends or online opponents.. i played this game for thousands of hours since release. now it may look very dated compared to other rts games but still it was very good for its time, for me its up there with RA, AoE, RoC.. One of the top 5 genre-defining strategy games, well up there with Supreme Commander, Total Annihilation, Command and Conqueror, Dune, etc. Any serious fan of strategy games owes it to themselves to play this - it is the source of many of the genre's conventions. The graphics are dated, yes, but everything else is of legendary quality, and you can pick it up fairly cheaply nowadays.. To this day the best multiplayer strategy game of all time. 3 completely different factions, yet perfectly balanced, still not sure how they achieved this, but it's a huge achievement. Incredibly fun, playable and fantastic on every level. The visuals, music, all the different troops with their voices, cinematics. The single player campaign was good, but it's the multiplayer that turned Starcraft into a timeless classic. 10/10. i don't really see how this is a star of the RTS genre there isn't much strategy, as the only real units you train are your first ones (I.E marines and zerglings) that's spam, not strategy.. Best RTS game ever.Very good game balance.3 race with different gameplay, in 1998 it was revolution.Also it perfect Multiplayer perfect game game.Fast and hardcore.. This game is awesome, but it really doesn't deserve as much attention as it has now. I have never played an RTS game that is as balanced as Starcraft. Even Starcraft 2, the acclaimed sequel to the game, can't beat it. Which is surprising, really, since everyone expected Blizzard to learn from their mistakes. Now, I've hear many idiots that say that this game is the traditional stats vs. stats and numbers vs. numbers. Nothing could be further from the truth. If you understand the speed and quality of each individual unit, the game could be so much more than just the free-for-all that many have chosen to make it. ""If you like it so much, then why do you say that it doesn't deserve publicity?"", you may ask? Because it's just a game. Honestly, people have been making RTS games similar to Starcraft for years. It's just the fact that Starcraft does it a little better than the average RTS game. Nothing to it. I'm going to go ahead and give it a 8, just because I spent a lot of time enjoying it. Definitely not a waste of money.. It's almost exactly like diablo 2... This game was one of the best of its time... If you go play starcraft or diablo 2 now its full of hackers but in its time it was the best thing you could get. Personally i would still play it over a lot of new games.. 15 years ago i have putted 8/10. It is still the best RTS game for strategy with the expansion pack Brood War. Very nice missions. Good story line. Balanced races. less : graphics, need to build from scratch in pvp which is annoying (like other RTS games) Game play : 7/10, graphics : 3/10, background : 7/10, lifetime : 7/10, sound : 7/10. Popular at the same time with Age of Empires. Two great RTS games with different backgrounds. The unit building process and technology tree in Starcraft are much simpler, allowing the players to put more emphasis on how to win the battles.. Single Player/Multi Player (2/2) (If the single player is better than the multiplayer, review this section as if it had no multplayer) (If the multiplayer is better than the multiplayer, review this section as if it had no single player) Gameplay (2/2) Visuals/Story (1/2) (If the visuals are better than the story, review this section as if it had no story) (If the story is better than the visuals, review this section as if the visuals didn’t matter) Accessibility/Longevity (2/2) (Review this section only on Accessibility if the game has no longevity) (Review this section only on longevity if the game isn’t accessible) Pricing (2/2) Wildcard (0) This is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a “feel” for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score. The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no “half” or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal. The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing. Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, **** has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a “feature quota”. Games that excel in both areas of a section don’t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the “wildcard” section. This section is for how the reviewer “feels” about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.. If pro players can make a LIVING off of this game, you know that something is right about this game. One of the if not the best RTS game made in a very, very long time.. I've spent so many hours of my life on this game, I may as well have gone pro. So much fun to play in LAN with your friends. Great storylines for each race, all interwoven together nicely, and very memorable characters. The graphics were fantastic for its time, I remember being very impressed by how realistic it all looked when I first played this. Now of course it looks dated and old, but they don't call it a classic because it's new; it's old! But it never gets old. Haha I no longer play the original, but I still have the CD and only uninstalled it finally about four years ago. I play SC2 now. You could probably get this basically for free from a friend or online and if you love RTS games, you cannot go wrong with Starcraft.. This game is a good RTS. There are many people who play the game today. It has a good storyline. The graphics and cinematic were good as well. Voice acting brought a new experience and leaves you to play more. I would recommend this game!. Back in the days when Blizzard were still small guys trying to make a living, they gave the world one of the best games there is. Enter StarCraft. With interesting story, addictive gameplay, this masterpiece was easy to learn and hard to master. Both unforgivable and rewarding, there was nothing like clash of massive armies, one of which you spend skill and resources to build, and controlled at your best. Immersing yourself in Koprulu sector for battles, everyday after school with your friends, building precious memories and nostalgia of a time when Blizzard did give a damn for you. These were the golden ages of multiplayer, and StarCraft was one of the giants. With time the game became a cult, a passion, a sport, a legacy which to this day is cherished, loved, respected. Today, the mighty Blizzard have fallen, they are nothing but a former glory, a shadow of once a great giant committed to deliver to his followers... But still, if you didn't play this game do yourself a favor, and taste what was Blizzard at it's best!. Even after 10 years, this is still a standout title. It's aged very very well. One of those games that you can't stop playing. It's an absolutely perfect example of easy to learn, hard to master, there's something here for anyone with any interest in RTS. Still doesn't look too bad graphically, well except for the cutscenes. After the first mission theres one in particular where the people are so badly rendered and the dialogue is so hilarious I was busting my sides. Even the better people look ridiculous. Blizzard had a nasty habit of having horribly modeled people with freaky faces. It's a really awesome game though, and I really suggest it to anyone.. Easily the best RTS game in history. Not for the faint of heart. For mavericks only. If you are a candle in the wind, this game is not for you. However if you consider yourself not to be a grab it and have fun. Best game ever made. Will never be surpassed. Period.. I really find it funny how some recent reviews criticize this game. I got this game the day it originally came out. And it was absolutely amazing! Up until then, almost all RTS games were just Command & Conquer clones, and the ones that weren't were usually bad. Starcraft revolutionized the RTS industry, showing developers everywhere: Hey, Westwood aren't the only ones who can do it. To date this is still one of my favorite games of all time and I still prefer it to its sequel. To anyone who speak hate of this game, well, I feel sorry for you. a shame you'll never have a real appreciation for games. Overall: A fantastic RTS game that will be treasured classic for anyone with taste.. This game is very good. Its's frustratingly hard, but it has solid gameplay and challenges the mind to think unlike any other game I'VE played. I'm not very good though and it is difficult to learn and master, so prepare to spend lots of time just learning basics. It is a good game non the less, though.. I remember playing this game for hours after it was released i enjoyed the multiplayer/map editor the most. It is one of the best RTS games created and well worth the time playing. It was not my favorite but it is a game that is very enjoyable to play.. Greatest game ever made. Nothing will ever beat the community of good ol' **** 1.0.. I have put more time into this game than any other game I've ever played, and that's saying a lot. This along with Chrono Trigger are the best childhood gaming memories I have. This game seriously does not get old, to this day I love playing on BattleNet when nerds aren't spam hacking the game list, and the UMS aspect of the game I think is one of its greatest features and one of the greatest features of any video game in history.. The prefect balanced RTS with 3 really different play style ! This game is only really polished with the units of the sequel (Brood Wars). Even i tested a lot of others RTS (included Blizzard ones) that one is for me the best balanced !. This is truly the best RTS out there. Its very skill based game with a really competitive game design combined with a balanced unit design. Just watching the games of competitive players is fun and entertaining.. Starcraft is a classic. Today,it is still one of the most popular franchises in the world! Yes its player base is set mostly in south Korea, but the skill involved in veteran game play is unbelievable! Imagine playing any other game with over 300 APM, not many games can claim that. It's too bad Blizzard (the producers of the game) set their sights on other projects including Diablo III and Starcraft 2 - it's projected to die within the year.. Starcraft is truly a landmark RTS game, and an absolute joy to play. I have spent hour upon hour playing this game and every moment was worth the experience. Even today Starcraft is still played, which is a testament to it's brilliant design.. Great singleplayer coupled with great mutliplayer creates an experience like no other. The music is great, the gameplay is fluent and solid. You'll have a ton of fun playing it.. Blizzard is master at creating games that require skill, thinking or planning. Starcraft requires all of them and plays out beautifully, on top **** story.. Classic game. Best RTS ever. On the golden table in Hall of fame for PC games. Just one word: Starcraft ! 10 of 10 and no other mentions to consider).. Epic. After almost 14 years, I still play it with my friends. Although his game created e-sports thanks to ****, its best multiplayer mode is LAN! LAN ftw!. Best RTS ever released for a few simple reasons. Its 3 solo campaigns are perfectly balanced from start to end, perfectly scripted, versatile, challenging and supported by an intense storyline that easily outshin","the new keyboard shortcuts are amazing as it reduces tue time it takes to choose soldiers, upgrades and constructions by 50% . the heart of the swarm gives great understanding of the Zerg race and the legacy of the void is a great temporary ending to the Starcraft storyline . can you believe it? it even skyrocketed to the status of a national sport in Korea ."
557.Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"Objectively best Assassin's Creed game ever made. Even tho i like Unity a lot, this one is still the best.. the most well rounded, and marveless game in the series. its well made in every regard honestly. and when I got it for my PS3 originally, I feel just as good about it now as I once did then. because its just the most fun assassin's Creed games. and its so calming to just sail on with out anything but the curtacy they have to also have plenty for you to do as well it absolutely wonderful. along with having one of the best stories in the series, it satisfies, sometimes simply, sometimes with a wonderful immersion, sometimes just being wonderful.. World is really pretty especially the open seas but the cities are not as interesting as the ones in previous games. Good and different protagonist with a nice personal story but the overall story is not that good because it goes all over the place and characters just appear and disappear too quickly. Voice acting is quite good but not great because of the some side characters, great sound and for me the best music in the series. Gameplay with the ships on the sea is great with finally some usable upgrades in AC games. On the other hand, gameplay on the land is same old and even easier this with all the gadgets and again no point of upgrading almost anything, hunting is still not utilized enough and there is too much filler in the maps with the collectibles. Exception are the sea shanties which are great. Best pirate game ever made and really good AC game.. best ac ever made when ubicuck wasnt trashhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Best AC game after AC II. Assassins creed in the world of the spanish empire vs british empire americas. Just epic cheeeet. The game forces you to complete several ""optional"" or ""secondary"" missions in order to upgrade your ship for main story missions. It's stupid and proves that Ubisoft has been a joke of a developer/publisher for a while. It could be one of the best AC ever, but Ubi decided to **** all over it.. Literally the best ac game so far. This was the peak of ubisoft. Its not only a great ac game but also a fantastic pirate and exploration game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of the best games I've played, it's hard for me to find cons in it, I don't take micro-bugs into account. Maybe too many stealth mission but it has a great story, innovative gameplay and one hell of main character. Just incredible! that grafics, sounds and gameplay... Fantastic I love thisGame, Ubisoft. I can only congratulate Black Flag. Not only for being an overall grand experience, but for also improving everything that III introduced. Especially boats, which the game heavily focuses on, and for good reason. If there's one game in the series that does them the best, it's this one. Other than that, all the characters are likeable, all the locations are stunning, and the story is one of the best in the series. Definately holds up well today.. My love.....memories.... Thank you assassin's creed and ubisoft for made my life with this legend.... My loves: pirates and edward kenway. Big map with little substance, most islands look the same and are very linear, the same goes for most other activities like hunting or diving, they are a copy/paste job with little dynamic. Weather feels too scripted and predictable as well. Story is boring with intrusive tutorials throughout. Fighting and naval combat were better in AC3, it's more arcadey in BF and animations are also a considerable downgrade as is the A.I and notoriety system. There's little incentive to explore as most treasure is auto converted to gold when there could have been some depth to the trading and far more interesting items and customization options, but it's like every other aspect about this game, it has no depth. There's some fun to be had but at heart it's little more than a superficial title with pretty graphics.. im playing all assassin creed but assassin creed black flag is worest assassin creed ship battle is very hard stealth is good parkour is good for my opitions this assassin creed is worest assassin creed. This game is like the first time I ate ****. It took a long time to get anywhere and it left the taste of seamen in my mouth.. Although this game suffers from the Ubisoft style of game development (repetitive quests and objectives), the variety of locations in the game makes up for many of such shortcomings and never ceases to bore the player with its interesting storyline. The story, while you are not given much choice in deciding your own path (which may be a turn off for some), tells a compelling story of a person growing to accept burdens and responsibility in more ways than one. Alike all other AC games, Abstergo Entertainment portions serve as a frame narrative for the ""main"" story within each game; personally, such portions help connect the implications of the story within the emulation to the consequences of the world in the present, making it a much more engaging and interesting story overall, even if such portions are a bit slow. The most stand out portion of this game, which deserves to be addressed separately, is the ship combat, which is perhaps the main selling point of the game. It is well-polished and fun despite its simplicity, and the processes to upgrade and customize the ships is a rewarding process that adds to your strength as the story advances. Mainly it is the extremely simple combat and repetitiveness that holds it back for many, but for any lover of sea battles and Assassins Creed, this game is a treasure trove of fun and lore for any that seeks it.. It was a fun Assassins Creed game to get in to. Because the isn't that lore heavy like the other AC games. And if you can just be a normal gamer and get into blackflag and its Mechanics. The story is quite nice aswell and gets emotional at some points, butthat's what makes this game really. So if you want to get into Assassins Creed then this one is for you.. great Pirate game with good combat a great story and agood Open world over all 8 out of 10. Boring assassins stuff. Good Pirate Story . Great ship gameplay . Wish it was just a pirate game instead of all the ac snoozefest. Very good game because it has beautiful graphics, satisfying and easy gameplay and a wonderful setting! The best AC on PS3 but I just don't give it a 10 because it has a lot of fps drops, it rarely stays this high.. Really fun game, but the amount of tailing missions make me want to die, good plot and game play though. Great character and story but in some mission very boring and too much tailing mission. Best AC game i have played. Plot, characters, graphics, seabattles are greate, also its pretty intense, full of content, never boring, fast travel works fine game is really good. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Flashing character and ship to remind you a typical Animus simulation,when you arent on straight mission track mission is failed,you can fish just on interactive points,characters are stupid and use stupid pirate stereotype phrases,all story dont fit AC mood either and some minor things that are not immersive in gameplay like shooting on forts before attacking it. Scenery is cool and have cool mood,cities well made but not original,battles feel mediocre. Must say for few minutes game is interesting after you found what you bought its misery. Compared to some pirate game I reviewed on Switch this is little bit better.. Ubisoft again doing games yearly with tons of bugs and disgusting gameplay/story. Just avoid this company.. In short: A good pirate + stealth game. The ship battles are pretty cool. From boarding ships, to docking/anchoring anywhere, to navigating, to harpooning sharks, to sending trade ships around the world, the sea is the highlight of the game for me. Personally, I did not enjoy the story much, but the voice performances are good, including the singing of the crew! The parkouring abilities of edward are fun when they comply, but he does feel a bit jittery. My main issue is that the game feels too long. I feel like I have been playing for 20 hours and nothing has happened in the story that is interesting yet, and the missions mostly feel the same. The only thing about the story that is cool is feeling like a captain and feeling like you are part of a larger coalition of pirates (with Kidd and Blackbeard). Shooting does not feel very satisfying, and the assassination button pops up a little bit too late for my liking. I'm only 25% into the story apparently. It is the prospect of playing this for another 30+ hours that makes me want to stop right now. I doubt the story, gameplay, or exploration will evolve much henceforth anyway. 80/100. With smoother controls, better graphics, and a more personal and meaningful story, I would have given Black Flag higher.. As the middle chapter of the North American trilogy, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag significantly expands naval combat gameplay and increases the emphasis on RPG elements. Edward Kenway's character development, following in the footsteps of Ezio through the trilogy, stands out as the most complete character arc in the Assassin's Creed series. The game, complemented by Brian Tyler's soundtrack, is a paradise for maritime adventure enthusiasts.. Great mechanics,great world building but forgettable and poor story but is good. Played for about 15 hours, 65% of the principal story before quitting definitely. I loved AC1 and 2 when I was a kid, didn't play to AC3 nor 4 but I liked Unity, Origins et Odyssey. Concerning Black Flag, the game is a bug itself. It's crazy how it impacted my few hours playing it... I had to start over several missions because of bugs. Characters are forgettable, The story is inexistant/boring, The sea travels are too long (and I love Zelda WW), The fights are long and repetitive, Stealth mode is a joke, The ""follow these guys when they are exposed and then kill them when they are surrounded by enemies"" missions are purgative... In short, I hated it.... One of the best assassins for me . . .. Great story. Great gameplay. Ship battles were GREAT. Parkour and stealth didn't aged very well tho. This game mixed everything good from the older assassins creed, and the broad map to use the vessel gave it deeper immersion, you felt like exploring as a pirate!. Black Flag was the very first Assassins Creed game I played, and one of the first games I played on the PS3.. Fast forward a few years and having completed every other AC game decided to replay it on the PS5. It still looks great even today, and its really hard to believe they achieved this on the PS3. It's for me, the best Assassins Creed game ever made, the best Pirate game ever made, and one of the best video games of all time. Nothing compares to the fun of sailing around, singing shanties and sinking enemies. Throw in the on land parkour, a great story, it still is an absolute classic.. Assassins' Creed is one of the most average franchises on earth, but this game does manage to keep things a bit more interesting with it's setting and gameplay mechanics. You will still hog through hours of mind numbingly boring dialogue and missions where you follow an npc that is as slow as the game engine allows them to be. If you can get past that, you can have an enjoyable gaming experience.. It's a wonderful game and i loved the naval battle mechanic, it has a good history and good combat and stealth and the development development of the protagonist is incredible.. An amazing adventure at sea. This is my the first assassins creed game i played lol and I enjoyed playing this on my ps3! Thank you!. After many years I tried Black Flag as I was interested in the pirate theme. Luckily I was impressed. Coming into the franchise fresh I feel I'm missing some key points in the story that would of been through the games library arc but the main story of Edward was easy to understand and surprisingly interesting. I liked the open world nature of the game. Being so vast at the time would of been novel as only few games achieved this on 7th Gen hardware. The graphics are beautiful, except for the characters face, still hold up today. There are some minor frame drops, it's as bad as other titles with less impressive graphics. Music is fitting. My favourite is being on your ship sailing in the seas hearing your crew sing shanties, really builds the mood of pirate theme. I just find blending assassins/templars with pirates in the Caribbean a little jarring. The upgrade system is fair. However, I did find I had to do some grinding for the resources needed at times. The game is worth your time clocking about 45hours on the main story and extras. There is some critiques I have though: - The platforming can be janky causing some frustration. I did die a few times where the character was climbing instead of running (or vice versa) - The open world is refreshing, I didn't feel the world was exactly ""alive"" compared to games like GTA. So travelling to islands seem like ""copy-paste"" and takes some immersion away - Post the 3/4 mark, the games missions tends to repeat themselves too often. A beatiful sequel of Assassin's Creed 3 with a fantastic free roaming **** a great setting of atmosphere and a beatiful story.Still worth it to play after a decade only one thing is bad the repetitive of combat system style P.S. (I Played both version of the game PS3/PS4 and XBOX360). Ship combat and exploration are the highlight in this entry. If not for some of the stealth missions and subsidiary game systems, this would be a masterpiece.. Assassin's Creed Black Flag invites players to embark on an immersive pirate odyssey that's brimming with adventure. The game's open-world Caribbean setting is a sight to behold, with its stunning landscapes and vast seas. However, while the naval battles and exploration are thrilling, some players may find the land-based missions and repetitive side activities to be a tad lackluster. Additionally, the story, while enjoyable, occasionally loses focus and fails to deliver on its full potential. Despite these minor gripes, Assassin's Creed Black Flag remains a swashbuckling experience that successfully captures the essence of piracy and offers plenty of excitement for fans of the franchise.. Bi improvement over Assassin's Creed 3, but runs horribly on the PS3. An almost unplayable framerate with the same old garbage Assassin's creed controls. Should have not been ported to the PS3.. The story is average at best, created in a true Ubisoft spirit. The graphics and the sound are good for an initial xbox 360 / PS3 title. The gameplay is quite good, with some more work needed related to the melee combat. All in all, it could have been a far better game if it was created by another company and not by Ubisoft which in her effort to deliver a game to liked by everybody, ends up making it average and bland. It is worthing 10 USD / EUR if you wanna buy it now and play it, but not more.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is, by far, one of the best entries in the series. It feels fresh and different. And you know that feeling? Yeah, the one you have when playing AC2 and that was missing from AC3? It's back.. Boring, repetitive and not difficult. It's a collecting game with tons of uninteresting dialogues.. Foundn this extremely difficult to get through which to be honest kind of made the game a frustrating chore . Otherwise tge graphics were as great as always and the story a beautiful complex thriller.. I recommend playing and familiarizing yourself with this game. I had fun playing this game.. I know everyone really likes Part 4 but there were so many aspects I did not like. For me this is the part where I started to be unable to retrace why someone must be killed.. I don't like naval battles, but this game is amazingly good, one of the best in the AC series. the game is so good the ship handling battle mechanics story graphics are awesome! but ship tracking missions are disgusting. Good mix of seawar, 3rd person fight games, stealth game, action adventure, diving, RPG and a lot of beach and sun. I love freeing slaves and cooperating with female pirates. And those great ideas with the sleeping and berserker arrows for the blowtube, the treasure hunting and gathering. It's not perfect (after 70 hours I won't replay that much) but very very great. One of my favourite games with Red Dead Redemption!. I may say this is a really good game and i had my fun with it, but i think it isnt as good as people make it to be, some good things are the world, its huge and interesting to explore, some missions when you are underwater and enter a cave were there are enemies its preety fun, the way you kill with the gun its great, i have to say that the story is really good too, but here is the thing, the graphics dont look as good as AC3, it looks so yellow and just not as great, it doesnt feel like assassins creed in some way like the cities, they arent big enough to mess around, and most of the places are islands, the worst part of the game are the naval missions, if in AC3 were bad, at least there they were side missions, here they force them in your throat and they arent fun, some ships are way to hard and unfair, other bad thing is the gameplay, i love AC3 gameplay and this is somewhat the same gameplay... but they made a manner to make it worse, i dont know i just dont feel the same fun doing parkour or killing enemies like in the last games, the sound effects are awful, the way edward runs, the fighting its just not fun, and the missions in the last games were great and unique, here... all the missions are to damn similar and ununique, its just follow this guy without him noticing, kill him, now do this awful naval mission, and again and again and again. i dont like the word overrated but i think this describes the game well.. This game was great I never got to play the next gen version of this game but its a solid assassin's creed game with a good setting and story but not the best game in my opinion but possibly the last good assassin's creed game , that could be controversial but I dont care. I guess Ubisoft didn't know that its engine was not suitable for multi-person battles at the time. There are a lot of bugs in the board thing, but it does. Also, Edward's story about going on this journey is ridiculous. Then they rescued it again with the events that developed. Also, did BlackBeard, a guest of legends, die this way? However, it is really a legend to drive a ship as you want on this large map.. This is my first Assassin's Creed I have ever played and since then, I started playing other AC titles. I absolutely loved the pirate theme, the ship battles are amazing with the epic ships battle. The map is huge and well-made. I absolutely loved every part of this game. The only thing i found not worth was the multiplayer, yeah, I think that AC titles aren't good at multiplayer, and this is absolutely ok, probably no-one bought this game for the multiplayer because singleplayer and the story is what matters here, and those two things were done so great, I think that this deserves a clear 10/10.. Bad... Very bad... I thibk this is the point when the storys in Assassin's Creed games begun to mean nothing. I know, maybe that's not the part of the game people look at when they plan an Assassin's Creed, but i think it's remarcable how this game makes it so bad. Also i remembered it to be funny, but lately i've played it again and i couldn't have been more wrong. The game it's repetitive and simple. I think this gane was the begining of the deterioration of the saga.. If you want to travel in a big open world, participate in ship wars and assassinate some people this game is just awesome. I didnt have big expectations and now i am happy with what i get.. I really loved Black Flag. I missed a good present storyline but it was fine how Ubisoft handled the special situation. The game itself was great. The protagonist, the story, the graphics, the setting, the ship and all its mechanics. I enjoyed that Black Flag really much even tho the assassin storyline began really late. I bought this back in 2016, but it's still very good in 2020. Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is the best Assassin's Creed game in the series, mainly because I like pirates. And this settings gives fresh air from the ""normal"" Assassin's Creed games.. This is my favorite Assassin's Creed game. Everything about this game is amazing. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. In my opinion, this the best Assassin's Creed ever made. But, there are so many problems. The parkour Is Epic and Explore the map is really fun. But the story is s**t, as a s**t as the mission. Follow people in my opinion is not fun, Sorry.. Forget about the American Revolution, in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag we are introduced to Connor Kenway's Grandfather, Edward Kenway, a Pirate turned to Assassin fighting and finding his way of life in the notorious times of plunder, rum, and women in which turned out to be very best AC title since AC2. The combat has been vastly improved from the first, the naval combat is exciting, and of course, the exploration of the West Indies is astonishing to wonder around on. The real star in ACIV is the history and that makes it one of the best gaming experiences we have ever got. Plus, the voice acting in this game is way sharper than its predecessors and I can see why this game is so good compared to the others. I thought this game would be a tragedy as AC3, then I realized Black Flag is an important piece of relic in AC history.. This game looks perfect. A freedom of moving, lot of sandbox things. But i feeled a bittersweet taste from this. I was dissapointed that its didnt continue in story of Desmond. Good humor in game. It could be way worse ... so 8/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Big map with little substance, most islands look the same and are very linear, the same goes for most other activities like hunting or diving, they are a copy/paste job with little dynamic. Weather feels too scripted and predictable as well. Story is boring with intrusive tutorials throughout. Fighting and naval combat were better in AC3, it's more arcadey in BF and animations are also a considerable downgrade as is the A.I and notoriety system. There's little incentive to explore as most treasure is auto converted to gold when there could have been some depth to the trading and far more interesting items and customization options, but it's like every other aspect about this game, it has no depth. There's some fun to be had but at heart it's little more than a superficial title with pretty graphics.. Good graphics, great exploration. Fun missions. Story was a bit naff tho. Definite improvement over III. +Ship battles and boarding +Open world is huge +Story is medicore. +Characters are medicore -Side activities -Combat -Enemy AI. Fantastic visuals and fun gameplay mechanics for the playstation 3 but a lot of glitches. You remember when the best parts of Assassin's Creed 3 were the naval contracts instead of the story, missions, and you know... what makes it an Assassin's Creed game? Well it's kinda the same this time, only now we can explore and forget about the story all together. By surprise Ubisoft was already working on a game take incorporated the naval missions in a full blown game. Needless to say the reactions were very positive. But now with over 80 hours in the game, did it deliver on expectations? First off, this game shouldn't have been called Assassins Creed: Black Flag. All the Assassin story line missions are a big fat stain on the game. It would have been better if this was a stand alone pirate game. And unfortunately some content you need to upgrade your ship is locked in the story missions, so that's a bummer. But when you just go plunder ships, upgrade your ship and take forts you are going to have an awesome time! I highly recommend you completely ignore the story and just start shooting ships to become stronger and stronger. So all and all it is a good game. It's a shame the Assassin's Creed content taints it. I give it a 7/10.. Unlike some of my friends of praise AC 1 and 2 and the best games of the series, Black Flag was actually the first time I was in contact in the series and I loved it! It doesn't really feel like an AC game, to be honest, it focuses more on the historical events than anything else but that's why I loved it! Couldn't recommend it enough!. The best Assassin's Creed game since Assassin's Creed 2. LOVED the sea battles.. Assassin's creed IV is a masterpiece. The naval battles, the new addition to this game, are fast-paced, fun, and control really well. The main cities are also very detailed and are a joy to explore. The story is amazing, especially the ending, and the main missions are the most fun in the entire franchise with some typical AC missions and some new unique ones which are equally as fun. There are tons of side quests to distract you from the main quest, such as the assassination contracts, which are really fun to complete. The jumping and climbing mechanics are executed perfectly, i've never had any problems while climbing buildings. The wii u version has a map on the gamepad, which allows you to see where you are going without having to pause the game, a really useful touch. This is one hell ****, and a must have for any assassin's creed fan.. Assassins Creed Black Flag is masterpiece its have big open world full of things to do, side activity to complete, animals to hunt and use it for armor or weapons, big fishes to kill on water, explore under the water, upgrade your ship, destroy templers outposts and many more things aside of that it have great story, awesome game-play, and beautiful graphics for any platforms. i highly recommend this game for every one.. This is more a game of pirates and ships than an AC game. If you plan to play other earlier games of this serie you should play them before start with Black Flag because there is an spoiler (from AC III). This is a good game with great graphics and very colourful. In my opinion I think they could have made a new game with a completely different story instead of extend the Assassin's Creed saga. This game is longer than the last AC games. It took me 28 hours to beat (including some extras, although if you want to do all of them you can easily spend many hours). In this game the naval battle is more complex than in AC III. An advise: make sure you have mortar's ammo when you attack fortresses.. This in my opinion is the greatest assassins creed game of all time. I know most of the fans prefer the second one and I also love that game. But this game is practically a masterpiece and it's also way better then assassins creed 3 which i was very disappointed with. There is so much to do in this game that you'll be playing for hours outside the story to do everything there is to do on the map. Lets get to the story. I'll be honest it doesn't feel right for an AC game. it's more pirate based but that's kinda the whole point. Edward kenway was a great protagonist and he's also very relatable as he's had a tough life and once to become rich through piracy to have an easier life with his wife. Now the naval combat, it was absolutely brilliant. Boarding and sinking ships has never been so much fine in a pirate game, it felt rewarding and badass and it was controlled perfectly and never gets old. The abstergo nonsense is unfortunately still in the game but it' still not as bad as it was in the past. I also got 100% on this game recently. Unfortunately there's only one thing I dislike about it. Kenways Fleet. It's basically a mobile game and a crap one. You have to wait at least 18 hours to get all the stuff you want and you can't speed it up and gets old. Luckily it's not required to have a great experience in possibly the greatest pirate game to date. Get it if you haven't already!. Not the best AC game but a fun pirate type game. The Good Great naval combat so much fun attacking ships and boarding battles very exciting! Nice tropical graphics and animation very detailed clouds, weather, even the towels are detailed on land. Music was nice touch loved the singing while sailing HUGE open world lots to do and explore The Bad The Abstergo corporate missions **** BAD. Please get rid of this crap nonsense in future or just use a few cutscenes. Was boring and STUPID. I hated the tailing missions waste of time and boring Disliked the poor jump and climb mechanics Definitely worth buying used for cheap. I liked this and AC2 the best in the series so far but have not played Syndicate yet.. I can't bilive how awesome is this game. You need to understand that i don't like AssasinCreed franchise, i despise because of game-play and missions ( You are a **** silent assasin that's why called ''Assassin's Creed'' but the game is so idiotic and repetitive nothing silent in this franchises. Now back to BLACK FLAG i freaking love it ; WAY? you ask because ,you say that you hate AssassinCreed franchise, because it haze nothing to do with the franchise beside the stupid movement , but otherwise is a PIRATE GAME with boat navigation, treasure hunt, robbed wat boats you found, pirates sings, and NO ASSASINS CREED STORY. This game is a masterpiece if you like pirates , and you want to play a good pirates game besides Risen 2.. I loved this game so much! The characters were complex and the story was interesting. The only thing that let it down for me was, I wasn't quite sure what was happening during some points of the story. I tried to keep up with it, but it was just too hard to follow. The look of this game is beautiful and I enjoyed the fact that the character was more a pirate than an assassin, which made it a little different.. worse story then AC 3 but amazing gameplay but if you want to use the Brotherhood system this time around called the navy you have to be online witch **** ****. Easily the best Assassin's Creed game ever made, Black Flag is rich with a stunning open world and an intriguing story. At first, travelling the high seas on a boat for hours promised to be a tedious affair, after the first sequence however I was sold. Not many games have completely immersed me in the world I was playing in, this was one of them. With so much to explore, so much to unlock, so much to discover, Black Flag is one of the best open world games ever made.. Assassin's Creed IV Black **** a mere master blaster its **** got first time full control of ships and a new combat system new way to select weapons and lot more stuff to do.must buy. Best action adventure open-world game and great environment and one of the best games in that year and assassin's creed franchise and the next two games unity and syndicate are having awesome gameplay content.. Black Flag is by far the best AC game since Assassin's Creed II. Everything about it feels fresh and new. The lead protagonist, Edward Kenway, is an insatiable rogue with a troubled past who is just as charming as Ezio and even more so than Connor. Ubisoft have truly redeemed themselves with this entry and it stands as one of the best games of 2013. Most of the gameplay elements from AC3 return, but are sufficiently utilised to create the best AC experience to date. Crafting is a lot easier and the incentive to plunder other ships to upgrade your own is strangely compelling and addictive. Most importantly, this game fulfils your unrealised desire to be an Assassin pirate.. The greater focus on stealth as well as improved combat and an awesome setting make this the best asassins creed in years. Also worth mentioning, the game thankfully doesn´t have a 3 HOUR tutorial (I´m looking at you, AC3) and lets you run completely free pretty early.. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HATES THIS EXCELENT TITLE, but is an excelent game, but with some details that are ","Assassin's Creed is the most well rounded, and marveless game in the series . voice acting is quite good but not great because of the some side characters . overall story is not that good because it goes all over the place and characters disappear too quickly ."
558.The Last of Us: Left Behind,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 10) Masterpiece - 9) Amazing - 8) Great - 7) Good - 6) Above Average - 5) Mediocre - 4) Below Average - 3) Bad - 2) Terrible - 1) Pile of **** - 0) Worst game ever contender. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good story that fills in some lost time between chapters. It was fun sending zombies on the human soldiers and running through unnoticed.. I'd love to remove this rating I'd love to remove this rating I'd love to remove this rating. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best thing The Last Of Us ever did was make a convincing zombie apocalypse setting, and showcase how people would actually react to it. While I certainly don't think The Last Of Us is as realistic since COVID happened, the world building, atmosphere, and characters still resonant pretty hard. Perhaps the best thing about Left Behind tho, is that it's all about the backdrop. Two characters just trying to live an old fashion normal life in this new hell world that requires survival as a number one priority. While there is still action and stealth in this game, the focus is entirely on character dynamics, and it works well for the story it's trying to tell. The game is fairly short as well, as you can beat this game in roughly 3 hours, but it's packed with more than enough lore and character moments that leave a far better impression than the original game itself.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A wonderful addition to part 1 of The Last Of Us, be sure to complete the addition and learn more about the story of Ellie and Riley, I advise you to complete it 9/10. 8.3/10 story: 9/10 gameplay: 8/10 mechanics: 8/10 Enjoyed the DLC. Wished there was dogging tho.. Boring lesbian drama. That’s all I hace to say. Unnecessary but at least there is a little more of the story. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Last of Us: Left Behind, the standalone expansion to the critically acclaimed game, The Last of Us. I played the expansion in 2015 first, one year after its release, and recently got to play it again. Left Behind showcases the great writing that made the main game memorable. The plot maintains a high quality, introducing the character of Riley, who, despite her short-lived presence, feels believable and convincing. The story, set in medias res the main game, unfolds through flashbacks, providing a glimpse into Ellie's past experiences with Riley. However, it seems that Ellie is not directly reliving these moments. Instead, the narrative juxtaposes Ellie's present challenges, where she stands alone, with her past moments spent with Riley. This highlights the contrasting dualism between Ellie's solitary struggles after Joel gets almost killed and the significance of having someone important by her side. While facing challenges alone, Ellie is forced to confront harsh realities of the world and the strength required to survive. Conversely, the moments with Riley provide a welcome respite, showcasing the warmth and joy that a meaningful connection can bring amidst the bleakness of their surroundings. The story, and its tragic ending (a moment not really shown to the player but its prelude), add depth to Ellie's character development and offers poignant insights into her motivations, resilience and trauma. The ""third option"" Ellie wanted is ultimately there for her, but only for her. It's a shame Riley is never referenced again the Part II, while other characters do. In terms of gameplay, Left Behind lays on the foundation set by The Last of Us. The mechanics are the same of the main game, offering a seamless transition for returning players. One aspect of the gameplay is the stark contrast between the sections featuring Ellie in the present and those featuring her in the past alongside her friend, Riley. The present-day segments are intense and challenge-oriented, sometimes to the point of being unbalanced on higher difficulties. Encounters with enemies can prove frustratingly difficult, requiring careful planning and execution. While this may add a layer of tension and realism that fits well within the post-apocalyptic world of The Last of Us, I would have still opted for more balance. The availability of weapons is also rather limited. On the other hand, sections with Ellie and Riley in the past are indeed a welcome break from the intense encounters. They offer a calm and enjoyable respite, infused with witty banter and a sense of fun. While these segments may involve relatively less frantic gameplay, they still manage to engage players and showcase the strong bond between the characters. The slower pace and focus on character development provide a change of pace and demonstrate the game's commitment to storytelling. Such a dualism, even in gameplay, done on purpose, by design. Technically there's not much to say except that it's the same incredible graphics from The Last of Us in 2013 on PlayStation 3, which still hold up well today. Overall, The Last of Us: Left Behind delivers an evocative plot and a compelling narrative with a mostly enjoyable gameplay experience. At the time, for those who loved the main game, it was an almost mandatory experience to play, while today it has practically been integrated into the main game, so there is no choice and this is ultimately good.. one of the best dlc's i have ever played. ellie's backstory is so interesting, tragic, and heartwarming.. I loved Last of Us 1, but Last of Us 2 was very interesting to play and not in a positive way. I was seriously enjoying the story about Joel's death and Ellie trying to avenge his death, and Ellie's romance on the side. It could have been one of the best games ever. Unfortunately, towards the end, I was forced to play as Abby. I really liked Joel as a character, and when Abby killed him, I, of course, developed a serious dislike for Abby. Furthermore, Abby is just a pissed-off, unlikable character in general. Thus, I really didn't want to play as Abby and found myself just letting zombies kill me because I wanted to return to playing as Ellie, and it was more enjoyable to watch her die than to try to help her survive. I tried to play it out as Abby, hoping it would return to Ellie at any moment, but hours went by, and it still made me play as Abby until eventually I just said, ""Screw it. I'm not enjoying this game at all, and I stopped playing altogether. I've played almost every rpg there is, and there is only one other game I have stopped playing halfway through. Thus, Last of Us 2 is one of the only games I rate as a 0 out of 10 since it was so unenjoyable that I didn't even finish it. The lesson here is NEVER FORCE THE PLAYER TO PLAY AS AN UNLIKABLE ANTAGONSIST, PLEASE. After, being so disappointed with Part 2, I don't recommend either of these games.. First things first: if you came here to complain because Ellie is a lesbian, you are nothing more than a cry baby. To be honest, I'm not the type that always plays DLCs, but this one everyone should play. They tell us more about Ellie's life, and how she got bit. How she's still just a teenager that dreams about being in a normal word, love and being loved, but unfortunately was born after the chaos. She's a kid that have to be an adult, and it's not fair.. This DLC was only made so people obsessed with weirdo s3x could change Ellies story. None of it is true. She is just a regular normal kid. The original Last Of Us is the only game. and its perfect. Joel and Ellie are still alive being normal people. Away from all the weirdos that made this and part 2.. One of the best games ever, but still cash grab. We get the third one the same.. While brief, this DLC is full of the same quality as The Last Of Us from its great graphics to its fun combat encounters. The extra layer of emotion added to Ellie and her past is appreciated.. a small adventure by the standards of the same add-on for Uncharted 4, not very many locations, but as a backstory it is very good, peculiar to the original with its details.. It's a nice DLC but It's honestly very short. There are some great moments in it, and Ellie's relationship with Riley is very well written. Also I personally liked how Ellie feels weaker than Joel, so killing enemies is more challenging. Overall I liked it a lot, but it doesn't really add anything new except from some more backstory to Ellie. Final Rating: ""Good"" ~ 7/10.. That's amazing. Thanks, Sony and Naughty Dog for their incredible work. No doubt, the best game I have ever played.. The Last Of Us: Left Behind is short but is honestly a pretty good DLC, I kind of wish they could have done more of these, to be honest. If you want to know more about Ellie's character and her backstory then here you go.. Amazing addition the the main game. Expanding on Ellies back story. Beautifully done.. Great expansion to the first game although it was a little too linear for me if that makes sense. I wanted to be able to explore around just a little bit more.. An perfect addition to the original story. The way this add on is presented is the perfect way to learn more about Ellie’s past. Swapping back and forth between past a present while showing parallels between the two was genius. As a result of this presentation we are given constantly compelling story as we want to see what’s happens within both timelines. This is a perfect add on that combines incredible character work along side tense combat sequences and some funny moments along the way that eventually leads us back to the tragedy element that these games are known for.. This DLC/standalone expansion is 2 chapters that were cut during the development of The Last of Us. By god am I glad they still released it anyway! The Last of Us: Left Behind features some of the best environments and encounters in the series. And after playing The Last of Us which left me yearning for a peaceful moment, Left Behind delivers the sweetest and most endearing content in the entire series. While short, all these years later, it's still my favorite.. Great DLC! Gave more of a focus on Ellie in an interesting way since all we saw of her in the main game was from Joel's perspective, apart from Winter. I personally think it definitely adds a lot to her story and her character, to see her being able to just be a regular kid for once. Gameplay is still fun, like the original, but I'm glad it took more of a backseat in this side chapter. Very happy there were no compromises on the graphics or any other aspects of quality, especially storytelling. Seeing her connection with Riley so closely makes it so much more heartbreaking for her character and everything she's been through. I do kind of get where some of these negative reviews from 2014 were coming from, given the price at the time. But way too many are actual homophobia, and *those* can definitely be ignored. I HIGHLY recommend anyone reading this to just play it if you haven't already, it only takes a couple hours. If you enjoyed The Last of Us at all, I'm sure you'll love this too. :). Waste of time and money. Almost corrupts the experience of the main game. Don’t give it any try. I hope they will enrich it an the remake.. The Last of Us: Left Behind is a short but thrilling prequel to the story of The Last of Us that delves deeper into the ongoings of Ellie's mind and how her bite came to be. It's not as expansive as the main game, but it still offers a brilliant narrative that feels like a well-polished extra chapter of the main game. It's included with the Remastered version for newer consoles, so I highly recommend you play it, if you already enjoyed The Last of Us.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ever-since I've finished The Last of Us story it was indeed one of the best games of 2013 because of its wise story-line and the characters felt realistic.I wanted more and more of The Last of Us and quite frankly this DLC manages to set very dark and very light tones. Playing as Ellie seems to be appropriate since her character manages to be one kick-ass teenage girl. We also get to explore her little journey with her best friend Riley. I don't really want to say much because this DLC needs to be played without giving out any spoilers. Though the game-play is still refreshing as always and now it gave it a more horror feel to it. And the graphics look very impressive as always. This is a good DLC to have if you're a fan of The Last of Us.. Best DLC FOREVER in Video Game For All The Time This DLC is Going Through The World. For myself playing left behind didn't feel like dlc. It felt like levels from tlou that were cut because it made the game too long or didn't fit well in the over arching story and had to be trimmed down. Oh and apparently Ellie's gay now for reasons that don't really matter. A short DLC that serves as a prequel to the Last of Us. I enjoyed the story of Ellie and Riley and the “Street Fighter” section in the video arcade was the highlight for me. I consider this a must-play if you enjoyed the original game. 9.5/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A nice addition to the Last of Us story. My only gripe with this dlc is that it's too short! With a less than 3 hour completion time, it leaves you wanting more.. The Last of Us: Left Behind is a decent expansion to the original Last of Us. The most notable addition of this expansion is infighting between infected and human combatants. The narrative of this expansion is okay but lacks any interesting developments feeling more like fluff. I would recommend The Last of Us: Left Behind if you enjoyed the original Last of Us.. Boring ,boring ,boring character , boring dialogs ,boring story ,boring world ,propagand LBGT. sony payed to score givers and ****'t waste your time and money. Wonderful, doesn't deserve any of the hate it gets. Emotional story which sets up the mood perfectly, just like any other last of us game.. This is by far the best game of all time the story and gameplay are a 10/10. Great DLC. It is a short one but it is a more personal aproach to Ellie characters. I think it has less story telling quality than the last of us original game, but it is a great DLC. A fantastic and important addition that expands the narrative of a masterful game. I would like to see something like this for TLOU2 as well, nice addition which fills 2 nice gaps from the game itself. same score like the main game and Chapter 2. Pretty awesome. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's a nice DLC, but It's honestly very short. I don't know if I recommend it or not, since it really doesn't add anything new except from some more backstory to Ellie.. A very good example of what a DLC should be. A short and good strory developing even more the characters and the world.. One of the things I like the most abot the TLOU series: It triggers Gamer Gate trolls :) You know? White Gen X dudes who have 'Leon' phantasies about Joel and Ellie. And I'm so thankful that Naughty Dog just keeps on messing with them. Left Behind is a masterpiece. End of the story.. The story (i am not sure if we can call this a story) is okay but the problem is it's too short. It takes 2 hours to finish and you can't feel satisfied.. This story was really amazing. The way it jumps between two different times in Ellie's life, both in a mall, was very cool. This is a MUST PLAY to anyone who finished the original game, but I don't know if it's worth the 15 dollars. That is the only reason I am taking away a star. If you can get past the price or got it for free, play this.. It was a terrible dlc. Don't buy this garbage. I hope Neil Druckmann don't be ND's next game director.. Left Behind is a DLC that you should play after completing The Last of Us in order to avoid spoilers. In this game you control Ellie and go through a short event from the first game that was not actually shown. While playing, you will go through a few flashback memories of Ellie that will reveal a bit more about her past and her time before the events of the first game. The gameplay mechanic is completely the same as in The Last of Us: you will encounter infected and armed people that you will either fight or seek for a way to avoid them. The only difference is that you control Ellie, who is much smaller and weaker than Joel. The game is short, it is just a small additional part to the main game. I took me around two hours to complete it. You might even be able to stretch it to three if you really want to explore every corner of it.. Left Behind absolutely justifies its existence because Ellie's backstory adds so much to her motivations during the base game. Ellie and Riley's relationship is so easy to get invested to from the beginning. The game switches back forth perfectly between a part in the base game and 3 weeks before she met Joel. Both timelines have natural parallels to each other as the past timeline slowly starts relating to the current timeline. Riley strenghtens Ellie's character immensely as she takes many traits and beliefs from Riley, and it also adds weight to many scenes from the base game. Although only 3 hours long, its narrative is strong and the $15 price tag is reasonable. By far, one of the best story DLCs ever created!. Heart wrenching backstory of Ellie. Gives even more weight for the ""main game"".. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Excellent DLC of a masterpiece game! Plus, great LGBTQ+ representation! I love it!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. best dlc ever i’ve ever played, so so fun and playing as young ellie was amazing. the backstory of ellie and riley was also so cool and seeing how ellie saved joel. No review present. No review present. No review present. No review present.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Emotionally moving, adds some informations about plot holes the from the initial game but not that important, too short for its price, but I personally loved to see and feel how Ellie truly is when she is herself without Joel or all the events of The initial game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not worth the money. Should probably be ignored This is the point when they went woke. The base game has way more to offer and is way more interesting with an actual well written story.. This works as a great DLC and expands the lore of The Last of Us, while not disturbing or altering the main game's story. This DLC gives a deeper understanding of Ellie and why she behaves the way she does. Like in the main story, Ellie has a great chemistry with her partner, which in this game is Riley, and I truly believed that these were two best friends trying to make the best of the world they live in, much thanks to the actresses great work. Cutting between the naïve Ellie and the hardened Ellie during winter trying to keep an unconscious Joel alive. It's an interesting dynamic of character which shows what she has learned between the two time periods. A problem I have with Left Behind is the runtime of around two to three hours. Those two to three hours are great, but it feels like more content could have been given to these characters, but at least it never drags or outstays its welcome. The new welcoming mechanic of making the humans infected fight each other is refreshing and makes the player react to battles differently and it shakens things up. If you don't have had enough of The Last of Us, then this is a sure purchase on your front. Just be prepared that it isn't that long, clocking in at around three hours maximum if you search every level.. Loved it, just what the game needed to expand its narrative. Very well made, I recommend it to all the fans of the first game.. Nice addition. which shows a little of Ellie’s background. In general, I liked it because it reveals more to Ellie as a character. The game causes a ton of PS4's to overheat. It's not even playable, I can't believe this has even gotten good scores. The system cannot handle it.. Good game ! I wish they could have built on jeols story a bit more but Great game otherwise. A great expansion to the original story. I loved the relationship between Ellie and Riley.. A great short story of Ellie. The storytelling is again the highlight here, the new character Riley is a great addition to Ellies backstory. Would recommend to anyone who is a fan of the The Last of Us. This is overpriced for what it offers. There is way more value in the base game. Note that the story is also infinitely better in the main game. This is the exact point in time where they invented, ""the agenda"". A decent addition to a masterpiece, i recommend you play it for the story, but you may only play it once. Not gonna lie, I cried with this game. Short, but sweet. I recommend it to everybody who finished part 1.. A brilliant DLC to an incredible game, this DLC slides into the main story perfectly and is a great additiona, if you enjoyed the main game then you must play this DLC. 10/10.. A moving short story in addition to a main game that its a masterpiece that goes deeper into character development, brief and simple gameplay but very meaningful.. Great DLC that fills some gaps in the game and adds a little background to Ellies character.. A fantastic insight into Ellie's backstory At barely more than two hours long some might feel Left Behind is a little too short. The story stands well on its on but also adds to the experience of the original game. The new combat situations stand among the best of the main game and especially the moments where you fight infected and humans at the same time are fresh and give a lot more strategic possibilities.. Overrated. Good Graphics & Sound. Average gameplay. Horrible story. Way more value in the base game and way better story.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Its great, its not that long, its like a side story, i liked it. Ppl are gonna hate on it bcs of the part 2 game.. Half of the content is quite good, and genuinely adds to the story of the main game, while the other half seems confusing and ultimately unnecessary to the greater picture.. Left Behind wasn't bad, but for max. 3 hours of gameplay it doesn't deserve a better rating. They could've just put Ellie and Riley story to that comic and the 'Mid-game part' in the core game. It didn't needed to release as a 'game'. At least it's for free on PS4 but imagine paying for this on PS3.. This is good DLC for best game ever. Adds some of Ellie's back story that was alluded to in the full game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Its fine short DLC after you finish the game, there are some fun mini games and the gameplay is overall the same as the actuall game but the ellies backstory wasnt all that interesting.. Left Behind is the perfect addition to the main game, using the same mechanics. What it adds is another proof of the developers' capability of highly intense, mature and emotional storytelling, filling in a few plot holes from the main game and providing the fans with the both uplifting and sad backstory of the beloved character Ellie. Just one advice to the players: Don't leave the Halloween costume store too early if you don't want to miss one of the most empathically crafted pieces of character building ever put into a videogame.. Left behind was a nice addition to the original game. Certainly because this DLC takes place before and during the original story. Focus was more on the person Ellie. It is not really a spectacle, but the reflection of two teenagers trying to have fun in a far-reaching and dangerous world is very sad and beautiful at the same time. Downside was the environment that felt monotonous sometimes and afterwards I still had many questions about Riley.. I only have a thing or two to say: A-This should have been free, total waste of money. B- Whoever put that Jak x reference should have thought about it twice, that is an awesome game, unlike the crap these guys have been pulling out of their asses.. Serving as a prequel to The Last of Us, (and a sequel to the Last of Us: American Dreams comics), you get to meet Riley for the first time, in-game, and are taken on a short (but powerful) journey of heart that emphasizes exploration, and if taken at a leisurely and appreciative pace, could be unlike anything you've ever experienced in the realm of gaming to date. Note: The head writer of Last of Us himself, Neil Druckmann heavily recommends that you read the prequel comics first (as do I), as they're official storyline, and they tell the story of how Ellie first meets Riley, which occurs before the story within this DLC, and sets the stage for a great deal of what occurs within it. ALSO, do NOT play this DLC before having completed the core campaign of The Last of Us, or else several major plot points will be tainted for you.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. This DLC is very short (2hours) and inconsequential towards the story. Its by far the worst DLC I had ever played. Good thing i got it for free, otherwise I would have been irate. Naughty dog was clearly trying to squeeze out every last penny from its fans and its rather pathetic. Nevertheless, TLOA is still in my top 4 games ever despite the DLC disappointment. this game perfect There's nothing wrong with it. Interesting Sometimes sad like a movie. I do not need words. buy now. The whole point of Ellie's character is her innocence and childlike quality, and all the emotional effect she adds to the main game is predicated upon that. This dlc strips her of that. It's just stupid, and it's terrible writing. It's done to be trendy and that's extremely patronising to the people it's trying to emulate. I was very disappointed that they went in that direction. As for the rest of it, I love Ellie, and I love getting to play as her. I did enjoy the whole thing. I was expecting a much greater deviation from the story though. I was thinking you might play as Joel's brother or something, and try to make a safe town. That would have been something interesting and new within their world, and given Neil Druckman's narrative prowess, it would have felt like a good short story. Instead, to follow the metaphor, it's like an unneccessary addition to an already perfect book. It's like buying a chapter that was quite rightly edited out. It's still great because it's The Last of Us, and I'll give it a high-ish score only because I want to be fair, but in the context of the story, just take it or leave it. You wouldn't be missing much. Weighed against The Last of Us, it ****. I'm honestly not sure whether it adds or detracts.. This DLC was not something I looked forward to. I have seen many DLC that are so low quality and add very little substance to the original. then I saw this through to the end and I have to say this effected me far more than the entire game of 'last of us'. the story of the two young girls rekindling their friendship was so deep and it totally drew me in. It was so well staged that I fell in love with Riley and after finishing it I have found myself in tears a lot recalling the precious moments they spent together. It's so magical, it reminds me of a lot of precious moments from my own life and the delivery is incredible. there were times that I just didn't even think of them as characters, the animation and lighting etc was so realistic I felt like I was looking at real people. The action parts and traversing the environment was fairly rewarding. I liked the change in the way the game plays with the different character. climbing and getting around the environment seems more of a focus with Ellie and the fighting also has me feeling more vulnerable. which is perfect for playing as a young girl. Fact is though, she can truly do some real damage and hold her own in a pinch which impresses me no end.. Easily the best DLC ever made. The story and acting are incredible, just as in the main game. Who would have thought hearing a character describe a video game inside a video game could be so engrossing? Plus, taking this part of the story out of the main game actually adds to the experience considering it partially takes place during a bit a of a cliffhanger of the main story. Playing the main game again afterwards, you pick up on a lot of references to Left Behind. Pros: - Plugs a critical hole in the original's narrative - Playing as Ellie is fun and noticeably different from Joel - Introduces a new scenario (infected and humans in the same encounter) that probably should have been in the original - Water gun section was fun Cons: - Not much is new here - Not a big fan of Riley's character - Arcade sequence was kind of cheesy True Score: 8.4. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Last of Us: Left Behind is an action-adventure survival horror video game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in. After inexplicably disappearing for weeks, Riley reemerges in Ellie’s life with a surprising revelation. The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their live. + Ellie and Riley Relationship. Left Behind is the perfect single player DLC to the masterpiece The Last of Us. It introduces the new character Riley and tells a heart warming story about her and Ellie's developing relationship within their apocalyptic world. Just like the original game; amazing performances, great graphics, great writing, great gameplay, and great music make Left Behind a masterpiece. This is the best DLC. Ever.. The brief moments of combat and puzzles are good. But the drama simulator between Ellie and her friend that takes up most of the DLC is overly serious, way too mushy, and doesn't add substance to the main game. I want to play a gritty post-apocalypse game, not The Gilmore Girls.. The best DLC ever made. If you you're a rah-rah-pow-pow shoot'em up type of person, then this DLC isn't for you. If, however, you absolutely love the universe created in The Last of Us and you value narrative and dialogue above all-else, you will get a bite-sized game that is polished on par with the original game. A truly fantastic prequel to TLOU that gives great insight into Ellie as a character and her life before meeting Joel. Also, you'll notice that almost all the negative reviews that exist for this game can't help but mention ""that scene."" It's clear that bigotry has motivated some angry reactions from some people. Don't let that be you. Play the game, pay attention to what it's trying to tell you and enjoy it. It's fantastic.. This is one of the best DLCs I've ever played. It's affordable and it provides a very in depth backstory to Ellie you couldn't get without playing the DLC. It's not the longest DLC but DLCs shouldn't be long as they are... well... DLCs. I recommend it highly!. Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in. After inexplicably disappearing for weeks, Riley reemerges in Ellie’s life with a surprising revelation. The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives. Didn't like the main game too much, but this part i just simply love it,now i see why everybody loves Ellie, i know there's a section on the main game for her but i wanted more, and this is it.. Very few games release worthwhile pieces of single player DLC. But, how can a masterpiece like the last of us go wrong. Well, Left Behind heads up delivering lackluster gameplay and the worst love story in video history. Not only is the revelation of Ellie being gay something that completely undermines this great character, but the banter between her and Riley (her actor does a horri","the game is fairly short as well, as you can beat this game in roughly 3 hours, but it's packed with more than enough lore and character moments that leave a far better impression than the original game itself ."
559.Far Cry 3,"one of my favourite games ever made. this is a masterpiece!!!! the characters are really interesting, and everyone know that vaas IS the best villian. The only game from farcry series that sticked with me; good stealth and storytelling from start to finish.. Listen... I get it, you get it, everyone gets it... Everyone understands that in order to make yourself a nice, healthy meal, one has to make the meal with a spread of many different things. Vegetables, fruit, protein, meat, a lot of water, and many others are a cornerstone of a healthy diet. Cut back on the fat, sugar, processed foods, or any substance that doesn't contribute to anything good in your body. And for most people, these types of meals are not only the healthiest but also the ones that make you feel the best after eating them. Once in a blue moon, however, your lazy ass sits there and goes, ""Damn, I'd really like some McDonald's right now... I won't even stand up and go there; I'll just have someone deliver it right to my doorstep."" So, the food arrives like an hour earlier than if you had just made a meal on your own; you load yourself with a million calories. It doesn't even taste that bad, to be honest, and you waste the day away feeling like you've just let down your entire family tree (all the way back to Genghis Khan) by enjoying that meal. Far Cry 3 is that once-in-a-blue-moon meal in game form. It is just a quick, blunt, and fun romp through a tropical archipelago with memorable antagonists, moments, and missions, with the game trying to keep your brain entertained by just giving you a bunch of enemies to shoot. It gives you an enemy outpost, tells you to approach it however you want, and whenever you're done with that outpost, the next one is but a two-minute drive away. Oh, you've driven over a nearly extinct komodo dragon? Make yourself a new wallet with its skin; why don'tcha. With the game's themes and gameplay melding surprisingly well with the story and ending choice. Yet most importantly, the game never overstays its welcome, taking me around 19 hours to basically 100% it. Everything in this game is that usual Ubisoft BS that we've all gotten tired of in the past years. Yet I still think that for what it is, Far Cry 3 comes the closest to perfecting said Ubisoft formula (probably; it has been a while since I played Primal or 5). And while I don't feel even remotely bad for liking this game, somewhere in the steppes of Mongolia, Genghis Khan is turning in his grave because I enjoy it as much as I do.. Have I ever told you, the definition of...insanity? This game is good, I don't want to say anything more. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Okay, so I got this game for free during a 2021 event or something. The gameplay itself is pretty enjoyable, except for the annoying cutscenes. However, what really bothers me are the NPCs—they feel like a ctrl+c, ctrl+v copy of each other. 90% of the NPCs share the same model with only minor tweaks, like tattoos or clothing. There are a few weapons to choose from, but fewer than I would like. Overall, decent game but you can spot it was made by Ubisoft :). Graphic engine is top as usual. Story and dialogues are a bit childish. Also the AI is dumb, Far Cry 1 had a better AI in my view. The open world mechanics are good ideas, but they distract from the main quests and some of them are redundant. No free saving.... A history changer game, it mixed the fun american style action to an immersive adventure with satifying gameplay, gameplay that is weirdly complex in its progression, for a fps, nothing crazy but for a AAA fps of 2012 it was incredible, it holds still to this day.. I have played every far cry game and this has to be my favourite. Its just perfect.. It's absolutely masterpiece. Definitely the best installment from its series. Excellent plot and charisma of the characters. Excellent soundtrack and soundtrack. Interesting gameplay. Decent graphics, which even in 2024 looks good.. Perfect game from UBISOFT Its optimized very good on PC 10/10 Best game at 2012. this game doesnt need much explanation whyi gave a 10, ii mean,there is a good open world, nice story, i love vaas as a villain.. crazy how good far cry was at some point, and its crazy how a series can fall apart when u just use for cash grab. Far cry 3 does a perfect job in terms of a survival game. It has everything what you could expect from a survival game. It had a great story except the fact that I lost some interest when I came to know that there is another villain after Vaas but the story do was interesting till the end. The locations and gameplay mechanics were all great. It felt alive and I was amazed with everything in the game cause it was my first farcry game.. Far Cry 3 is one of those games you've always heard about but never played, and the day you decide to play it becomes a unique moment. For me, the main reason of Far Cry 3 to be a masterpiece, is the way our character transforms after days of living on the dangerous Rook Islands, immersing us in a universe that shows us the true 'definition of insanity,' and draws our attention with a great antagonist who, in many moments, proves to be a reflection of our hero, Jason Brody, who in just a few weeks goes from a fearful, rich, and spoiled tourist to a killer who begins to wonder if there's still a shred of humanity left in his soul.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Even before I played it, I thought Far Cry 3 looked amazing, especially from watching Allanzoka’s gameplay videos during the Electronic Desire GE days. If I recall correctly, it was the last game I bought for the PS3. Everything about it is fantastic, and it still feels fresh and relevant, never showing its age.. Graphics - 9 Story - 7 Gameplay - 7 Open world and activities - 7 Good open world with incredible characters. I may be blinded by nostalgia, but the Caribbean setting and ambiance of the terrain brings so much life to the game, elements that aren’t present in any other far cry. The story resembles the great films of Stanley Kubrick and Scorsese, perfectly representing the descent to madness and violence of the characters. What happened Ubisoft…. im extremely surprised at the complexity of this game's story, and its very fun gameplay loop that other modern games have tried to copy but fail to do. the story is deeply philosophical and told through the gameplay and cutscenes. it makes you question things people take for granted. it tries to grapple with the deep chaos within by presenting this fantasy landscape to enact all those dark actions but letting you contemplate the implications by showing the transformation of the main character through these dark deeds. Vaas, who you meet early, is the most standout villain, because he embodies the nature of human chaos naturally with an authentic depiction of human rage and contradiction. There were some rage-inducing moments with glitches that show the game's age but the pacing of fun gameplay and intentionally well crafted story more than makes up for everything.. I can't explain how good this game is. Starting from Visuals, Story, Soundtrack to Villains, Characters & Gameplay, everything is just 10/10 perfect. But playing this game made me so nostalgic and melancholic cuz i realized we'd never see games of this quality from ubisoft ever again. Since i heard they are remaking AC4, i hope they remake FC3 someday too. Would be great to enjoy this masterpiece with better graphics!. Amazing game and none of the far cry games have felt anywhere near asgood since. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now clone. I can see how important it is in the canon, but still didn't really enjoy it. I think it mirrors both Apocalypse Now and Heart of Darkness so well that it includes the clumsy commentary on imperialism and colonialism.. Graphics still hold up to this day. Sound effects and voice acting are decent but the sound quality of some NPCs is very bad. The soundtrack is good, it fits the game very well. The open world looks nice and is quite large but as far as side activities go, it's not very rich or creative. Action is fun and can get very intense in the first hours but it becomes too easy afterwards, no matter the difficulty you're playing on. One of the reasons for it is that some weapons are seriously overpowered when equipped with a silencer. The second issue is the enemy AI, it certainly needs more polish. But I think the worst part is when the second island is introduced; second island is not as interesting as the first island, both gameplay and story wise. The story itself is good, but it could've been much better. Multiplayer mode is basically dead, nothing worth mentioning there. Personal Rating: 7.5/10. OG. More like 8.6/10. Must play. Beginning of my Far Cry journey started from this one. Ubisoft found their perfect formula.. MS16 with muffler&blue scope is the best rifle I have ever played in FPS games. Love its sound and head-shoot feeling.. The formula is complete. Ubisoft managed to take what was great from the second instalment and turn it into an absolute masterpiece. The story for FARCRY 3 Is incredible. The setting of a tropical island is a massive step up from the deserts and jungles from the second game. As soon as the game started with its opening cutscene, I knew this game was going to be good. The voice acting and actors they chose for this story kept me engrossed and I always wanted to see where the story was going to take me next. There’s a skill tree in this game and you are generously rewarded skill points. I was able to fully get all the skills before the story was complete and with all the skills and the knowing of how to approach certain enemies and situations, your basically unstoppable. The game is not that hard, but there was a few missions that stopped you from going in guns blazing and instead you are forced to be stealthy and that it self for me was difficult point to get past. You can distract enemies which makes it easier but if you have 6 enemies in the same spot then it’s hard to break them all up. There is a crafting system in this game, which by today’s standards is not daunting or difficult to get a hang off. Ubisoft have filed the map with animal locations that are visible from the menu map once you’ve synced up with the radio tower for that section. The crafting system tells you what animals to skin to get what you want and it’s generally that simple. There are hunter quests that unlock rear animals but there only used to craft the last upgrade for a item. The map is filled collectibles and different things to do so you’ll be able keep yourself busy, it does however get quite tedious. You have to climb loads of radio towers around the map and to get to the top of them there’s all different ways to navigate them. You can’t just climb the ladder to the top, it’s like a obstacle course that they’ve set up. The controls can be a bit janky at times especially the jumping so be careful when doing the radio towers because if you fall, depending on how high you are, you’ll probably die and have to try again. If you reach the top, you can synch with the tower and it’ll turn that section of the map visible and you’ll be able to see the roads, outposts, certain collectibles and more. There are loads of enemy outposts that you can liberate and once liberated they act as a fast travel option which is really good because the map itself is quite big so to get around more quickly it’s definitely worth doing these to unlock the fast travel system. the controls feel good, the gun are responsive and fairly accurate and you can upgrade your weapons to make them even better. The radio towers once completed will also unlock weapons for free in the shops around the map. So if you do all the towers you can actually unlock all the weapons for free except for the signature weapons then ones you have to buy. Overall this game is very good. Reason I have given it a 7 is because although the story is of good quality, the side activities is what brought it down. The side activities make up about half the time it takes to get 100% so half of this game is very tedious and not engaging at all. I would recommend to anyone who like first person shooters or to anyone who is interested in starting there FARCRY journey. This is a good game to learn the ropes of what was to come later down the road.. Still the greatest far cry game to this day. The story, the characters and gameplay still phenomenal.. honestly the best farcry by far, it was a revolucionary game, the movement, the combat, all is perfect, maybe the graphics are not the best but its an old game. One The best games i played it has the best dialogue the best story really liked vaas i think he is better than the main character jason. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Far and Away is my favorite Far Cry Game. The problem with giant open worlds is that you can't add much detail. That's the beauty of this game. A small open world dripping with detail. Still has crazy bad guys, a strong story, and bases to capture. The guns in this game are so fun. I will play this game over and over.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good history with jason (being dumb lol) Great gameplay. Good caracthers. A realistic game. Fun game with cool stuff to do And a Great stealth. I Totally recommend.. Masterpiece with a great enemy.Great graphics,great story and the shooting is just AMAZING. So good that it actually ruined a franchise. Great, one of a kind, story that falls off the rails in the second half, and if you played the game you know exactly why. The only Far Cry you need to play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the best in the series, this game is a formula that ubisoft and many game developers would use for the next decade.. One of the best games Ubisoft has every put out, but the actual game is just okay at best. Open world is beautiful to look at for a few hours, but there isn't much to do apart from taking over camps. Combine this with a shoddy story and combat that gets the job done, you have one of the most average gaming experiences you could possibly find. Vaas is a great villain, but he doesn't bring the game up any higher.. One of my favorite games of all time. Man those casowarys are scary.. Teenage Nostalgia fix. A real classic. the story and game play is so crazy i love it. The best Far Cry ever. Far Cry 3, is simply the greatest far cry game ever, you can still play it even in 2023 whit no problms, infact it still better than thousands shotting games you can't resiste the felling of stealth and action mix, a great map build and an extraordinary artistic design. a rich world whit a geat story whit Vaas witch is the greates villan made by ubisoft side by side whit al Muallem ( Assassin's Creed 1 ) Makes Far cry 3 one of the best games ever made.. The enemy AI in this game is pretty realistic It's like they have realistic human sixth sense You kill somebody with a suppressed sniper and they figure out you're out there somewhere they will shout ""Sniper"" and then they will hide in cover for a certain amount of time then coming out to search When you're in a firefight they get even more realistic when you get behind cover they won't notice and lose track of where you're at so you could just come up behind them and take'em down also every enemy in the area does not know where you're exact location is they're going to where the sound of the gunshots are. If you throw a rock too many times, the enemies would notice where it's being thrown from. The enemy AI in this game sets up so many different ways you can kill them.. Disappointing. The pros: Great story telling, solid driving and moving mechanics, the tattoo system is fun. The cons: where to start? The game is way too easy, the enemy spo. Best game of the series. With its story and gameplay, it had a special place when it was released. But I can't say the same for the games that came after the third game. Sequels did nothing but copy and paste the third game and could not carry the series beyond 2012. If you've played the third game, you probably don't need to look at the other games because it's like you've already played them all. Sequels don't change in terms of gameplay and graphics, they just become extremely mediocre in terms of story.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Incorrect definition of insanity/10. For real though, there's a reason this game's formula has been copied by Ubisoft ever since. This was probably before the one Ubisoft higher up got all **** and still kept his job to boot.. Visually really, good for that time. Its a pretty big map and but the MC is a blank slate and useless idiot when it comes to dialogue. Gameplay - 9 Plot & Characters - 8 Storytelling - 7 Pacing - 7 Music & Sound - 7 Replayability - 6 Performance - 10. Best Far cry game. It's so nostalgic for me good story good gameplay and very good characterization.. Nice Game. Would love to play again in future. Good Graphics and mechanics!!!. I like this game more than others. I guess that's because it's the first Far Cry I played. Sit back on your broken finger such painful fantasies were very interesting.. Far Cry 3's lush, open world, crafting system, and compelling story make it one of the most memorable FPS experiences in recent memory.. A great game, quite an interesting plot with interesting characters. Based on that time and the present, this is a good project. Of course, there are a small number of visual but not critical bugs. I advise everyone to go through it, because the plot itself has a pretty good message, namely the maturation of the main character and the change of his character in accordance with the surrounding society.. Unplayable on modern systems. Ryzen 7, RTX 3060 = 45 FPS? I'm running Windows 11 with two screens (game running at 1440p monitor with the ultra preset) Also the game crashes every 5-10 minutes. Ubisoft please fix. I've heard it's a good game so it would be a shame to lose this game.. Good game from 2012, but it never beat COD Black Ops but anyway well done Ubisoft!!!. Far cry 2 is better in it's own way, but this is definitely the best game as a whole.. Very nice graphics at that time. The trailer was impressive. Finally, I didn't finish that game fully (only about 60%). Even in 2023, it lives up to the legend—a great game from an innovative team.. Amazing characters, awesome to play again and again, a LOT of things to do on the open world, great enemies and guns, great difficulty, i just really missed achievements on PC. since i got all of them on the xbox. Best game of the franchise by far. The best open world FPS i can remember.. I played the game and finished it. The game is good, but I encountered technical errors in the game. Errors : -First of all, it is necessary to collect animal skins for development, but it feels as if the animals are teleporting in the places shown on the map. I realized much later on the first island that it was easy to find in side quests. - I said side quest, but side quests also have technical difficulties, for example, in an animal hunting mission on the top of the mountain, I found one of the escaped animals holding on to the rock facing down. It wasn't very pleasant. - On the second island, there was a problem in animations when trying to overlay the character's **** grip in one of the tower opening parts. When I tried to jump in, the character jumped over it instead of getting into the handle and threw himself down many times. Cons: -The upgrades are okay, except for weapon upgrades. - The weapon improvements part are as follows: While the attachment to the weapon is very limited, when too many add-ons were installed in the weapon specially provided by the game, I inevitably had a feeling of bitterness. -Boss fights weren't much fun for me. -The bad guys gave me the image of an ordinary crazy character. - The change of our much-mentioned main character, Jason, did not pass me by. For example, when collecting animal skins, it always felt as if he was disgusted doing it. - Even if I put a silencer on the gun, it felt like the AI ​​always knew I was there but pretended not to see it, and since there were armored men who didn't handle bullets, stealth didn't seem like an effective method to me. Pluses : The feeling of hitting does. It is very comfortable to drive. It's fun to burn enemies. Weapons are fun to use. Visual quality is good. My rating: 6 out of 10.. What made this game so good was the morality and character progression... At first Jason felt like he was the victim but like after the 5th tattao or idk 3rd oddly shining pill. Jason became more than a victim he became... An Florida resident our **** of a mc turns into Schwarzenegger leaving no victims behind, boddies hitting the floor and kids wondering why their father hasn't raturned from market (he wore red that day rookie mistake). I need more near extinct animals to make belts and coat to sell on Albanian black market. At the end he **** ebony chick and dies painfully too i rate this game 9 rather than 10 because there is not enough organ selling action going on.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Not perfect, but one of the best games ever made. Gameplay and story work together in an unmatched way, even if the story and pacing isn´t flawless. No wonder so many games are copying this, and not being as great as FC3. It´s great, but impossible to replicate.. ""We hold ourselves back too often. Imagine how fast you can achieve success if you do what you want."" (c) Hoyt Walker This part is definitely better by an order of magnitude than the 1st, and even more so the 2nd, a good plot that in the middle is just as catchy, but the abrupt change of scenery closer to the ending didn’t like it a bit. The gameplay is cool, it's nice to shoot from a large selection of weapons (half and did not try xD), there is a craft of a fairly extensive number of things, flora and fauna of the game. The only thing I didn’t like was the empty open world in which there was nothing much to do except clear outposts of pirates and mercenaries, cut down towers and hunt, a bunch of extras. quests that are not very interesting to pass because of the routine. The game is 11 years old and this is not an indicator, for fans of the open world from the first person I advise you to play (especially after the 2nd part, it will seem like heavenly pleasure to you), fans of more corridor shooters should think about it.. my favorite far cry game to date. Its just something about this vibe at the island. Story was great and Vaas was even better. One of my favorite villains of all time. Sidequests are interesting and just overall gameplay is good for its time. Kinda reminds me a little bit of LOST. Far Cry 3 is a typical Ubisoft piece of schütt game. Open world full of nothing but treasure chests. Besides the main storyline there isn't much to do. Few side quests worth s_it, repetitive camp captures, bounties, races and map revealing towers we all know from Assassin's Creed. There's a non-functional crafting mechanics which require you to do grindy work, hunting animals, picking plants. Simply put, you can't carry two weapons unless you skin two goats. This garbage mechanic is present in following year's AC Black Flag. But you won't get short on money due to UBIquitous chests. You can't do anything with your money, only buy guns and ammo, certainly not hides, right? The gameplay offers stealth even lamer than any AC game released in 2009 or later, health system is very forgiving, it's easier to die climbing a tower than in combat. The game didn't get hard enough to make me hunt tapirs or cassowaries. The story is teenage cringe with disgusting elements such as incestuous and coomer themes. You even get to choose a bad ending disguised as a coomer one. Shame on anyone who chose this ending.. A well-written bad protagonist, successful characters, fun to play, fun open world and side quests. This game tried different things in the open world and was successful, even now other games are trying to build on this game.. Villain and story is good. First game that has ""Open World Ubisoft Pattern"". Which I mean, radio towers, outposts etc.. The best game of the series. I play this game every few years and have a lot of fun.. amazing experience, amazing game, very good history, a very charismatic villains, and two ends a ""good"" end and the ""bad"" end but don't worry any disappoint you. Pretty good .. Did I ever tell you the definition of Insanity? It is Far Cry 3. The most remarkable open world fps ever created. Great story, great characters, great map, immersive gameplay and the most remarkable villain.. Excellent game. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Graphics 9/10 Sounds 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 Story:7/10 DLC:6/10 Game made with heart. A CLASSIC, the graphics obviously is basic, old game, but that's the best Far Cry, gameplay, lore, characters, maps, exploring, all of this game is really good, except for the company, if you want to play Ubisoft games, just play the classics. They lost themselves and just releases games that are bad copies of each other.. Perfection. Beautiful. I loved every second of this game. Chefs kiss. If I had one day to live, I would spend it playing this game.. This Far Cry was a blast, never got tired of it, restarted at least 5 times. The plot was pretty awesome with the greatest character in the franchise, Vaas. Even the soundtracks was good, starting with MIA - Paper Plane, then destroying the weed farm with Damian Marley ft Skrillex - Make it Bun Dem in the background. Pure gold.. It is like FC4 but with fewer things (takedowns animations, weapons, vehicles, worse graphics, etc). Even FC4's story I think is better (I know that is an extremely unpopular opinion). For me Vaz is the most overhyped villain in the videogame industry, he is just a crazy person that isn't even the final boss and appears just a few times in the game, I think it is only 3 times. This is to me the theoretical maximum of any game with the ubisoft formula, breaks my heart how this sagas features were so brutalized by the newer games. Not a 10 only because the second island is not as good as the first. This is the game that made me want to live in a jungle, grow weed and get a driving license. Is this one of my favorite games of all times? Yes! Will I try to be objective while rating it? Amogus I’m gonna start right off the bat with whom this game is for. Do you like weapons? Do you like drugs and dubstep? Do you happen to be an antisocial person attending an educational institution with an unending urge to end the existence of other people in said institution? Play Far Cry 3 instead of doing something stupid, like listening to dubstep. Full review on my blog! Hope you like it. ****/2022/10/05/far-cry-3-2012-jungle-weapons-and-vaas/. Very good game, great shooting mechanics, great map design, solid villains. Among top 3 best games Ubisoft has ever made.. You and your group of friends (Liza, Daisy, Grant, Oliver, Riley, Keith.) You went to an island to have fun, but it didn't end very well and you were captured by the pirates of Vaas, and I won't spoil it any further :) This game is very cool you have to crafting things like weapon holsters, backpack, wallets to make new stuff, but to make it you need to hunt animals and skin them to upgrade your stuff, and crafting is easier than it seems, you can also craft medicines to cure you and stuff like that. The graphics for that time is really great, the game is really fun, there are very many animals from animals like boar, deer, bear, tiger, buffalo, leopard to sea animals like turtles, sharks, etc. In the game you upgrade your skills with one thing and I don't want to spoil that, Overall this game is overall fantastic, everything is great for the time, the boss fights are fun, you just won't stop enjoying the game, and I just can't find one downside to this game, this game is an absolute masterpiece.. Very well done and satisfying first-person shooter with many RPG mechanics wich i really enjoy. Additionally the story is very addictive. I have played this game a few times and i have never been bored while playing.. Sorry, but positive feedback is not available in your region. At least until your leadership changes the two-faced policy in their actions and statements.. This is the best part in the Far Cry series, where absolutely everything works here: the story, great gameplay, amazing graphics, various missions, as well as the villain in the form of Vaas, who proved that the correct use of madness is the key to a good villain. One of the rarest games that makes that connection with player. And graphics by time was great too. Onky side missions were boring, but that didn't affect gameplay.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. -5/10 story -9/10 characters (Vaas carries) -9/10 voice acting (Vaas carries) -8/10 music (weed scene carries) -6/10 gameplay. wild, enjoyable, qualitative. this game is really good, its really fun and interesting to play. some episodes became iconic, just like this game and its for a reason, game is great. The third part of the Far Cry game series is a good game with a bunch of cons, but looking at what happened to the subsequent parts is one of the best parts! You can play. Meow:). i love this game its just sit into my heart with this music characters and atmosphere. Best Far Cry ever! Thanks for happy childhood! No Far Cry has ever been so exciting.. Even though I didn’t care too much for FC2, I decided to give this game a try because it received excellent reviews. Like FC2, FC3 is an open world game, but this time it takes place on a beautiful tropical island. FC3 has a fairly interesting story with drug-induced hallucinations and several psychopathic villains you have to defeat along the way, most notably Vaas as one of the most intimidating villains in any video game. Unfortunately, the sole gameplay component of this game is gun fights against generic human goons, which eventually became too repetitive for me over the long campaign.. I can't describe it, Far cry 3 is one of the best games on the planet and also the best game in the series... everything is perfect, from the map, animations, physics,Weapons, Water graphics and beautiful, weapon customization, graphic violence, rich animal biome, incredible story, memorable villain, vehicle gameplay far superior to games where the focus is just driving (TDU2) when UBISOFT knew how to make games. One of Ubisoft’s greatest games and undoubtedly at the top. In my opinion Far Cry 3 is the best open world action-adventure first-person shooter game. It also features role-playing game elements and stealth. Realistic graphics, Far Cry 3 had the best graphics at that time. Remarkable game play and exciting story.. I recommend playing and familiarizing yourself with this game. I had fun playing this game.. Perfect game, perfect characters, perfect villains, perfect story, perfect graphics (for 2012), perfect gameplay. An excellent game with very good graphics and a charismatic main boss. A very good open world with many side quests.. I am actually on my second play through of this game. This was the game that got me started on the Far Cry franchise. The games really draw you in. I highly recommend this game, Far Cry 4, and Far Cry Primal. Do not underestimate Primal either. It is very good. I was reluctant about it because it did not have modern weapons, but it turned out to be extremely good. But, for me, Far Cry 3 is the game that started it all. They onl","farcry 3 is a quick, blunt, and fun romp through a tropical archipelago . the game's themes and gameplay meld surprisingly well with the story and ending choice . it's a great way to get a feel for your body after eating a meal ."
56.Devil May Cry,"Gameplay absolutely tanks the value of this game. Graphics aren't the best, soundtrack is decent (has some solid tracks in there), and the story is whatever. You're better off forgetting this game exists.. I have already played all this game and it was crazy in every sense. I decided to buy this game because many people say that it's legendary and when I played it, I became a great fan of this franchise. Dante and Trish are great and funny characters; probably my favourite character of the game was Dante. The villains are pretty good and I like that they have differents attack mechanics making the game more varied. The last boss is the perfect definition of an stressful and difficult boss that you feel incredible when you defeat him and I like the variety of weapons. However, the missions became a bit repetitive and I didn't like the camera of the game because it became so awful in parkour missions. In summary, my experience with this game was amazing and enjoyable despite some details.. I remember this game entering many 'Top Ten PS2 games' lists in around 2005, so I headed out and bought it. I loved it so much I bought 2 &3.......however when looking back from 2024 this game is interestingly cringe. Sexualised comments, cheesy 80s dialogue, absurd childish views that make you thankfull that games have moved on. DMC 1 now seems exceptionally outdated in many ways, but some of Dantes moves remain brilliantly thrilling after all these years.. Based on my experience with the PS4 Special Edition HD port, I’d like to share my thoughts on the game and provide a more nuanced perspective. While this port may differ slightly from the PS2 version, I believe it's important to delve into the unique elements of this collection in 2024. One fascinating aspect to consider is that Devil May Cry's origins stem from an initial concept for Resident Evil 4, which involved a different story and character development, ultimately leading to the creation of Dante. This backstory adds an interesting layer to the game's identity. Elements like puzzles, in-game files (including beta references to castellans), fixed-camera angles, and even remixed music from the Resident Evil franchise contribute to this legacy. However, this fixed-camera approach can create a challenge, especially since much of DMC1 relies on puzzle-solving and platforming. The camera mechanics sometimes detract from the experience, making it tricky for players to navigate their surroundings effectively. A more dynamic camera system could elevate the gameplay by providing better spatial awareness. Despite these challenges, DMC1 manages to establish a distinct atmosphere that contrasts with the modern steampunk aesthetics of later entries in the series. The gothic ambiance is compelling, especially with the eerie movements of mannequin enemies and the atmospheric exploration of the dark castle. However, it’s worth noting that the tonal shifts might leave players feeling a bit uncertain: Is it an action-packed game, a gothic horror experience, or a survival action challenge? While combining genres can foster innovation, it may also lead to mixed emotions, making it hard for players to determine the intended feelings—be it excitement, somberness, or frustration. The narrative in DMC1 highlights Kamiya and Itsuno's differing storytelling approaches. The plot offers some intriguing moments, such as Dante, reminiscent (unsurprisingly) of Leon, ventures to an occult island at the request of a mysterious woman. However, the story sometimes feels sparse and disjointed, making it difficult for players to fully grasp the overarching narrative without any prior or subsequent context. Character development is another area that could benefit from refinement. While Dante has his charming moments, the gameplay often limits deeper exploration of his character. The cutscenes tend to either serve comedic purposes through Dante's banter with bosses or convey emotion through Trish, yet there’s little depth in between. Supporting characters like Trish and Nelo Angelo have potential, particularly Trish, who could have provided a more substantial presence throughout the game. Moreover, Dante’s response during Nelo Angelo’s climactic encounter could be more impactful, adding emotional weight to the moment. Regarding controls, they reflect the design choices of their era. While they aren’t excessively challenging, they can feel somewhat clunky at times. The auto-lock system, alongside the fixed-camera angles, can create difficulties during certain boss fights. The checkpoint system seems to demand a bit more leniency, as players are required to rely on gold orbs or restart entire missions after dying, especially in higher difficulty settings. This might be frustrating, but it also encourages perseverance, leading to a strong sense of accomplishment upon completing challenges. It's also important to mention that the graphics can appear somewhat dated in 2024. Some in-game audio may lack clarity, which can break immersion. Though the voice acting isn’t subpar, it occasionally adopts a campy tone that veers into unintended **** a player, it does give the game an odd charm, even if unintentional. Devil May Cry stands out as an innovative title in the action-adventure genre. Being the initial entry in the series, it’s fascinating to observe how its foundational elements have shaped the franchise and been developed further in later games. The game's distinctive atmosphere is complemented by inventive gameplay mechanics that were quite ambitious for a title released in 2001. However, this unique identity seems to bring some tension when considering Hideki Kamiya’s view of Devil May Cry as merely a hack-and-slash offshoot of the Resident Evil franchise rather than an entirely distinct entry. This perspective points to certain design choices within the game that could be seen as problematic. For instance, the camera angles often seem to hinder the player's experience instead of enhancing it, the repetition in level design can detract from the overall immersion. Fortunately, ""Devil May Cry 1"" lays a strong foundation for the series, introducing memorable characters and striking designs that Itsuno would later expand upon in subsequent instalments. Despite its dated shortcomings, it retains a charm and nostalgia that many players will appreciate. .. One of the greatest games for the PS2. IMO its a must play for any gamer that is bored.. A fun and short game. The combat was pretty nice, having a lot of alternate weapons to choose between, though it was kinda clunky at times which is expected from such an old game. Figuring out the levels was also pretty fun, but could get confusing at times, which may have just been my own fault for not reading the instructions or hints properly. The story on the other hand was alright, it really picked up near the end, but the ""emotional"" bits just didn't land.. I'm excited to see what the other devil may cry games bring to the table, and hopefully some areas improve. Overall super fun.. Is a really fantastic game, i recomend it to the new generation gamers if they are looking for a challenge, they will not be dissapointed.. Dante sparda ds the goat and the gameplay is peak Dante sparda goat vergil sparda is goat Luca goat ed and dmc >>>> re. One of my favorite action games ,Hideki Kamiya 's genius design made this game so unique and gorgeous .Will never forgot the burning blood and sweating moments immersed in the DMD mode .. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. a short fun experience if you want a silly action game with clunky dialogue and crazy bosses to enjoy. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I think DMC1 is one of the greatest games to exist. I haven't seen a game that could hold up this well. I remember playing this game for the first time (for context I played this game more recently and not on the PS2) and thinking the graphics were great for a game over 20 years old. The challenge of this game is one of its best features. When you think you just beat the hardest level in the game, the next level is harder. Each level makes you think of new ways to play the game. I won't give any spoilers but the final boss had me sitting there for over three hours trying to figure out how to beat him. Overall I think this is one of the best games to ever come out and more people should play it. Also Dante is one of the best main characters to exist.. Father of modern hack and slash, patron of all character action games, the beginning of the most stylish saga of all time!. An influential action classic. ""Devil May Cry"" initially began as ""Resident Evil 4"", but evolved into its own thing. It's like ""Castlevania"", but with the action amped up to the extreme. This is one of Capcom's best games on the PS2. Fans of tough action titles will love every minute of it. I would rate this with a 9.1 out of 10.. Pretty interesting concept for a white boy with mommy issues. The final boss was kind of a pain first time playing through.. I love this game, it is a great start to the saga, the levels have a dark atmosphere that I love. Graphically, for a PS2 game of its time, ""Devil May Cry"" is a visual spectacle. The gothic environments, the detailed character models, and the fluid animations give it a distinctive look. It's like a rock concert where the visual effects are just as important as the music. Gameplay-wise, it's the birth of the stylish action genre. Dante's acrobatic moves, the combo system, and the satisfyingly over-the-top combat – it's like a guitar solo that you can control. The game's emphasis on style points rewards players for pulling off flashy moves, creating a gameplay experience that's as much about looking cool as it is about slaying demons. Now, let's talk tunes. The music, composed by Masami Ueda, Misao Senbongi, and Masato Koda, is a head-banging mix of heavy metal and gothic orchestration. It perfectly complements the high-octane action, and the iconic battle themes are like the anthems of a demonic mosh pit. And the narrative – well, it's a bit of a mixed bag. Dante's demon-slaying adventure is as campy and over-the-top as his combat style. It's like a cheesy B-movie script that revels in its own absurdity. Some might find it endearing, while others might roll their eyes at the melodramatic dialogue. The fixed camera angles, a common feature in games of that era, can be a bit like a challenging guitar solo – thrilling when you nail it, but frustrating when you miss a beat. The limited exploration and occasional backtracking might feel a bit dated for some players. In conclusion, ""Devil May Cry"" is a groundbreaking title that laid the foundation for stylish action games. The exhilarating gameplay, striking visuals, and pulse-pounding soundtrack make it a classic that's still revered today. The campy narrative and some outdated mechanics might be a turnoff for modern players, but for fans of the genre, it's like revisiting the roots of an iconic sound. Strong 9.. Devil May Cry is a good game. The combat can be fun at times, the story is weak which is this games biggest flaw. The level design is good with some extremely memorable levels. But the game gets boring at some bits. Some of the bosses are ridiculously unbalanced. Other than that, Devil May Cry is a perfectly good game.. The game's level design is another standout feature, offering a mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and intense combat encounters. Each level is intricately crafted, presenting challenges that test both reflexes and strategic thinking. The atmospheric environments, ranging from eerie gothic castles to demonic realms, contribute to the game's immersive and darkly captivating atmosphere.Visually, ""Devil May Cry"" was a marvel for its time, featuring detailed character models, dynamic environments, and fluid animations that added depth to the game's action-packed sequences. The game's soundtrack, characterized by its intense and adrenaline-pumping music, perfectly complements the fast-paced combat and adds to the overall immersive experience.While the game received praise for its innovative gameplay and stylish presentation, some criticisms were directed at its camera angles and occasional repetition in level design. Additionally, the difficulty curve could be quite challenging for some players, requiring a degree of skill and practice to master.. While certainly an impressive title for its time, the game still suffers from the same issues that I recall bothering me as a child. The camera angles are horrifically annoying, the voice acting and characters are an almost ""campy"" sort of bad but just don't reach level of irony to elevate them past plain ""uninteresting"" and the combat is a chore when trying to rack up long combos (in no small part due to the dreadful camera angles switching and swapping nonstop). Overall, however, I still had fun with it, especially once you learn to live with the game's shortcomings.. This is a really good game. It was really difficult in places, but the point of the game is to get good to have a chance. It hasn't aged the best, there are some not very good parts. But it definetly set the basis so the other games (excluding 2) would take and make it even better.. You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. Devil May Cry is truly a fantastic experience and one of the greatest video games to come out of 2001. While it may not have aged the best, with its camera angle changes, attempt at platforming and underwater segments, really not holding up. The rest of the game is till a fun, cheesy, flashy action romp.. What began as a Resident Evil sequel eventually transformed itself not only into its own franchise, but its own genre. Devil May Cry is the granddaddy of the 3D character action genre, and with stylish action, humor, and a memorable protagonist it still to this day remains one of the genre's best. Some of Devil May Cry's sequels may have surpassed it, but Hideki Kamiya's original classic still holds its own by comparison.. Classic masterpiece.. What can I say that has not been said one million times before. I know: I rented the game and beat it in just 2 days, but I still remember almost everything about it. Unique, amazing, extremely fun.. I enjoy the game but like many said there is defenitley spme stuff that hasn't aged well, I will start with the story is pretty straight foward when you not look deep in the character dante is a devil hunter managing a shop, he go with trish a demon look like his mother to an island that he can access the one that caused the tragedy of his family which is the ruler of the demon world he go through fight encounter a magma spider, bird, slime and his brainwashed brother go to the demon realm find in the last fight that trish is betraying him in the last nightmare fight and asked him to stay away mundus exploit his human side trish sacrificed herself dante take dowm mundus and escape the collapsed island which trish and mundus showing up the latter giving dante the power to seal him away they escape and they a platonic hunters dou I have with it but the writing feel it lack the direction if to be dramatic or action packed. For the gameplay combat is good to use is maybe not satisfying as kirby and the forgotten land's combat but I feel good when things click right the bosses I enjoy for the most part phantom is good,nelo angelo is great though his third fight can be annoying from the camera griffon is tedious and nightmare is great, mundus I enjoy but I really don't like his homing light orb move, as for the difficulty is somewhat difficult I wouldn't call it one of the hardest games I played but I say I do not enjoy to play the game on higher difficulties cause it make the game more a game of ignore enemies as much as possible more than anything and when I play DMC1 I enjoy much more to fight my foes but the game and enemy placement just force me to take the resident evil route which make sense consider this meant to be RE4 but is still a hack and slash game for the weapons alastor is great for mid range, ifrit feel good when I want raw damage, sparda yeah use it once and go to alastor for good, the handgun are nice but once I have the shotgun and granade gun which the latter I use a lot I only use them against nightmare and griffon, the nightmare gun is good but I only used it against the main phantom boss fight consider the rooms make good use of it's shots devil trigger is a solid mechanic a stronger timed mode that you need to keep combat to pull the most but really unless the enemies aren't a good choise with the grande gun I use it to get my charges. My biggest issues with the game are the camera which is fixed but is sudden fixed which change the placement suddenly and it really become annoying over time, and the secret mission they either tedious like secret mission 5 and 8 or feel too short like secret mission 2 and 6 and well fighting the 4 bosses mutiple times get exhausting especially nelo angelo 3 which the camera really get me in off gaurdand I do wish dante was a bit faster he feel a bit stiff. In conclusion I do enjoy the game but like I said it didn't aged the best I did try it on my switch due to wanted to try something new but I am pretty sure once I done with it after few more playthroughs I pretty much done with it, it does have decent amount of replayability but I feel the system should allow replay older levels without new game plus for those who only few items short to get all. This is a good game, but I was sadly spoiled by playing the others first. This is the first time I have plated after playing all the other titles and it's an amazing start, but it's just feels a bit clunky. The few times where were confused and couldn't figure out where to go but then I remember that Resident Evil level design where I have to find keys to door and door to keys and when I first got that into my head. I found all the rooms. On the combat side, it is a good first step but I never really thought that it was smooth. I mostly used the ability to fire lightning in the sky because I just didn't want to fight the enemies. The story is cheesecake and feels like it's just meant to set a foundation, which I have set about three to four times already, but it's just that kind of game. It's just predecesses to What is supposed to come later. I am very happy. I played it but I'm not going back to it. This is just one of those games where the sequels are so much better than the original.. Outstanding game, boasting incredible fluid gameplay that was way ahead of its time in 2001.. Great development from Resident Evil Veronica, nice combat for it's time, but repeating bosses, stupid plot and cringe characters make this game unworthy of your time. If you want to start DMC series, I recommend to do it from the second part.. Janky but Fun. The third game would later go on to perfect what this game did but this game is still a good time. The underwater mission was awful tho. The game has really good gameplay for its year. Good moves are beautified with good effects. The graphics are generally good. Enemy designs are nice but repetitive. The story is interesting but could have been wider. The music is awesome. The reason I gave 1 point less is the camera angles. It can be frustrating most of the time. Repetitive boss with orb spawning on it. And the final boss was disappointing, it looks beautiful but it was easy. It is one of the games that we can call legend in general. It has inspired many hack and slash games.. for the first of it's kind devil may cry is definitely innovative, although for todays standards pretty outdated, the soundtrack is still very good but i definitely think that the game is a bit overrated due to lacking gameplay, confusing tasks and boring enemies which makes the game lack character and just makes it an edgy 2000's ****. It's masterpiece it's just perfect game forever my best game I loved this game so much. Devil May Cry marked the beginning of a new type of action game. This Capcom classic began life as a Resident Evil installment, but evolved into an entirely new thing. It combines the gothic adventure of Castlevania with the stylish action of The Matrix. However, some cheesy line readings do give it a campy feel. While DMC is now quite dated, there's no denying its place in history. You can see the game's influence on God of War, the Ninja Gaiden reboot and Bayonetta. Overall, this is a landmark title and a must play for action lovers. I would rate it with a 9.1 out of 10.. One of the best PS2 game. The start of legendary series. I love this series. The game prioritizes combat above all else: the narrative is simplistic and sloppily executed while level design is dull with only some barebones platforming and shallow puzzles present to add some insipid flavor. Despite this, combat is engaging enough to make the experience firmly enjoyable, offering a nicely sized set of distinct weapons combining and evolving to allow great combo flexibility against a challenging set of enemies displaying varied attack patterns rewarding mindful, strategical offense.. No nostalgia here, I beat it last year. The game wasn't bad. The bosses are fun, the setting is pretty creepy and Dante is a cool pretty boy. The camera is a bit weird at time, but I understand. Apparently this was the original design to RE4 or something? If so that's awesome.. Excellent Castlevania Art style and enviroment decent scary music that fits the enviroment the story really good so much detail into the enviroment and so much rich history and mystique when you read items and objects the combat mechanics are simplestic and good there isn't much combos to style on your opponents the combat is not as complicated like in DMC 5 but that's to be expected since DMC 1 is the first game the combat is still good enough for DMC 1 the graphics are good for a Playstation 2 game 60fps 1080p resolution with the HD collection for ps4 that's awesome bosses are kinda repetitive i don't get why we have to fight the same boss 3 times but at least a few bosses that you have to fight 3 times use a few new attacks they could have done better there and add a lot more boss fights and leave the major bosses for the end the difficulty of this game is hard and i like hard games and the challenge i'm all about that so it's good that the game is really hard even on normal difficulty the game is hard once you start playing on hard and especially on dante must die the game gets super hard on DMD you just get 1 or two shoted and the yellow orbs make the game harder because when you run out of them you gotta start the mission again from the beggining the untouchable items are cheesy broken every DMC game has something that makes you really overpowered or makes the game easier this game has a close up camera system in the HD collection which is good because you can see your character and details of the game closely but bad for camera viewing angles sometimes you can't see anything from a viewing angle the original DMC on PS2 however has a pulled back far away camera which is great to see everything the secret missions in this game are fun 10/10 One Of The Best Action Games Of All Time A Must Play Game. This game aged quite well. Love the atmosphere in this game. soundtrack is perfect. Difficulty is pretty high and I was smacking gamepad buttons like crazy almost all of the time. Hope they'll remake this game someday with modern graphics.. No the best Title of the Series, but this was the start **** Series of Games. It's pretty short, but it puts in a decent amount of Story and really great gameplay.. There's nothing quite as satisfying as destroying your opponents with style and finesse, and the first entry in the Devil May Cry series revels in it. Combat, while a bit tricky to get the hang of at the start, can quickly be overcome with simplified pacing that never gets old. Traversing through Mallet Island bears much fruit to the player, but with simplistic puzzles and level design leaves a bit to be desired. The self-aware plot is entertaining and is quite a motivator when chopping demons to bits, but ends on a somewhat melodramatic note that feels like the writers trying to pluck your heartstrings to no avail. What this game gets right, also leaves a few things to be desired, but ultimately is definitely worth your time, especially when the game itself is only about 6 hours.. The first Devil May Cry game is an acquired taste. If you were introduced to the series when it took a more over-the-top action hack 'n' slash with cool combos direction, this first entry isn't really going to impress. It very much feels like what this game was supposed to be prior to the name change. I'm personally not really a fan of Resident Evil type of games. Devil May Cry feels like classic Resident Evil with a flavour of hack 'n' slash action. The presentation is mostly fine and the mechanics here work, the voice acting and cutscenes are rough, but it's still a mostly enjoyable game. Even with some of its dated and questionable design choices.. Obviously good game but it has rubbish plot and characters. Battle system is good but the third and etc parts has a way good combats. Is it classic? Yea. Is it a good game? Yea. Is it the best game in the series? Of course not bc we have DMC 3 4 and 5 which a good evolution of this combat system. DMC has it's atmosphere which i'll remember. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE TO FILL YOUR DARK SOUL WITH LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT!!!! funi game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. You could tell while playing this game that it didn't figure out its identity yet and it had a lot of similarities with Residents Evil. However, I'm happy that they moved on in the future installments. DMC screams early 2000s with its soundtrack and voice acting but I can't lie and say that I don't love these things. DMC is a great game with a clunky combat system. DMC is a must-play for fans of the series or hack and slash games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Grat atmosphere trough this game, the levels are really onirique with demons and different creatures the bosses are nice the gameplay is really varied for an old game the story is okay but the rest viens combler le tout. Great game. There are a lot of fun combat encounters. The combo system is very cool. Music is awesome too. The game can get annoying when you die because you have to restart the entire level. The story isn't anything special but it doesn't break the game for me. The game is fantastic.. I got it from church today but it is ready for you baby I love it too babe hope your hours work hours will. This game is fantastic. Excellent setting. Combat that is while simple executed fantastically due to the unique scenarios the player is placed in. The story is cheesy but fun and interesting. The bosses are some of the best ever made in a video game. My favourite DMC game.. Wow! I love it! It really flashed me. Definitely gonna buy more and play more ofc! Must play it.. Good game for 2001 with nice battle system and it is a pleasure to play it after 20 years without a old feeling.. (completed on PC as a part of Devil May Cry HD Collection). Devil May Cry is without a question an innovative title that has laid the groundwork for modern hack and slash, but it also has a very distinct, idiosyncratic artistic identity and vibe, which make the game iconic on its own. The visual presentation, be it the architecture of the ancient castle the game is set in, the character and enemy designs, the menus, - is really bizarre, ornate, with details that only hint at some background but never indulge in exposition or direct symbolism. You're wandering the places and seeing things that weren't meant to be understood by you, that compose some twisted, almost alien world you don't belong in. The simplest example to make would be the orbs you collect as currency, healing items, and tokens for other game mechanics. They are brightly colored screaming heads, reminiscent of both the Behelit and Harry Potter magic candies, in appearance and meaning: it's not of our world, we don't and won't know how it functions and what's it really for. This surreal feeling, this mystique is all over the Devil May Cry and other aspects of the game contribute to it no less. The soundtrack is filled with wobbly distorted samples of a cathedral organ, ballroom music, bell tolls, echoing screams and whispers, that all come together to create a cold, looming and pressing, yet wondrous atmosphere. That's for the ambient part, of course, because when the battle starts heavily mutilated, grungy guitars and breakbeat drums kick in (on top of everything listed prior, often), accompanied by gestures of electronic music straight out of some late 90s UK rave. It's enthralling, frankly, like a spell, both in tense combat and during the slow-paced exploration. The gameplay is really hard to dissect sufficiently in a short manner, but it's enough to say that the combat mechanics are laser-focused, concise yet deep, and rewarding. Still, some options aren't realized to their full potential and may seem lacking in comparison to others, and the lack of convenience features does make the combat flow feel jarring and dated sometimes. Progression systems are thoughtfully tied to both exploration and combat, and a great part of acquired enhancements widen your arsenal instead of directly making you stronger, which lets you significantly improve as a player alongside your character. Your character being Dante - possibly one of the most iconic video game protagonists and for a good reason. Having not yet completely realized his cheeky attituded, he is a mystery himself in this installment, as well as his rival, Nelo Angelo, constantly popping up throughout the game to test your skills. Learning their connection is sincerely tragic and gives some weight to the final encounter with the game's villain - the weight that the love interest plot fails to deliver. The story overall does feel somewhat barebones and tacky, mainly because the series has not yet found its delightfully campy and over-the-top vision. Devil May Cry is a magical experience and a good game. It feels surreal in an arcane, mystical sense, to which every aspect of its composition deliberately and masterfully contributes.. With it’s RE4 vibes this franchise was born to be the best hack & slash of all time, Dante and Vergil as one of the best duo/rivlary. What started as RE4 became DMC and man am I glad. DMC was amazing with a kickass protagonist, good story and good mechanics. I can still hear the the start street stating up....... ""Let's Rock Baby!""..............""Devil May Cry"". This is the first PS2 game i've played and best game in this franchise in my opinion. 2001... long time ago.. Maybe it sounds harsh with the first release of DMC, however, it has a plot that apart from being mediocre, is not told in a correct way, considering that Capcom has Resident Evil releases since 1996 with a better story. The gameplay is a bit weird, it still seems to have a certain base of an RE and it takes a while to get used to it; it feels limited and repetitive but it's understandable. In the end, this first game in this saga left me somewhat disappointed. PS: I played the HD version for PS4, and despite being a remaster, I think for the time it came released on PS2 it looked pretty good.. A very fun game that pretty much invented the hack-and-slash genre. As frustrating as it is, it's equally rewarding. Only complaint is the story. You can tell that when this lost the Resident Evil status, they really didn't know what to do with it. Without going into spoiler territory, let's just say we're left with a story that's pretty crappy.. The game is a masterpieceit's a must play to everyone ","gameplay absolutely tanks the value of this game . graphics aren't the best, soundtrack is decent (has some solid tracks in there), and story is whatever . sexualised comments, cheesy 80s dialogue, absurd childish views ."
560.Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania,"Great levels, great bosses, and the possibility of more Castlevania that isn't **** machines? Who are these people and what have they done with Konami. Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania is a very welcome addition to Dead Cells that is a lot more than just a simple fan service. Both games are combined in a perfect way, and you can really feel the amount of passion that the developers have with Castlevania when making this DLC. The stages have glorious visuals and the iconic soundtrack from Castlevania is reimagined through some delightful remixes on Dead Cells style. The new weapons make combat very powerful and exploration of Dracula's castle very exciting. I very strongly recommend it.. It's Dead Cells! It's Castlevania! Need I say more? A great homage to a great, often now overlook franchise.. A gorgeous, fantastic, addctive, and memorable love letter to the classic Castlevania games, especially Symphony of the Night. Everytime this game is mentionned is a big win for me.",Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania is a very welcome addition to Dead Cells . the iconic soundtrack from Castlevania is reimagined through some delightful remixes . the new weapons make combat very powerful and exploration of Dracula's castle very exciting.
561.Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart,"The game has very diverse planets and guns. This feels just like the older titles of the series. The main problem i had with it is the amount of game breaking bugs i encountered. I am probably an exception out of everyone, but at the end of the day. It might happen to anybody.. What a wonderful gameplay ! So much fun, the game is absolutly beautiful ! Go go go !. A really fun game, basically no loading times at all, which impressed me a lot, and even more weapons than before. I enjoyed switching between Ratchet and Rivet and following each story, and learning more about Lombax history. However, it wasn't quite as tight an experience as the previous installment.. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is an impressive showcase of what the PlayStation 5 can do, with jaw-dropping visuals, near-instant loading times, and seamless transitions between dimensions. The gameplay is fast-paced and polished, offering plenty of fun weapons and thrilling combat scenarios that keep things exciting. The addition of Rivet as a new character adds fresh energy to the story and expands the series in a meaningful way. However, while the game excels in presentation and gameplay, the story feels a bit predictable and lacks the emotional depth needed to truly stand out. Some of the humor also doesn’t quite land as well as in previous entries Despite these shortcomings, Rift Apart is still a fantastic experience. It’s a fun, action-packed adventure that fans of the series will enjoy, and it’s a great introduction for newcomers. While it might not be perfect, it’s a solid entry that showcases the potential of next-gen gaming.. Strongly recommended, the game is very enjoyable with great narrative and gameplay and fantastic graphic, full of funny and lovable characters. Very memorable game.. Such a good game I haven’t played this franchise since I played the 2nd one and oh boy I had fun getting back into it.. I put this down about halfway through 2 years ago and I'm not sure why I didn't come back to it sooner. I recently picked it back up and found it to be a slick, enjoyable shooter. It's of a higher calibre than the 2016 reboot, with this sequel offering a little more across the board. It was an early attempt at showcasing the capabilities of the PS5, with the graphics and seamless rifts continuing to impress. Rift Apart is a short but sweet linear shooter with plenty of fun weapons to play around with and level up, fast and fluid movement in and out of combat, varied environments, and an extremely polished presentation all round. I really enjoyed it.. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is not just a game—it’s a spectacle. From the moment you boot it up, it’s clear that this is a visual masterpiece and a shining example of what next-gen hardware is capable of. The level of detail in every character, environment, and particle effect is jaw-dropping, and the seamless transitions between worlds showcase the full potential of the PS5’s SSD. It feels like playing a Pixar movie, but with even more interactivity and vibrancy. The story and characters are equally charming. Ratchet and Clank are as lovable as ever, and the introduction of Rivet and Kit adds fresh energy to the franchise. The narrative is lighthearted yet heartfelt, with themes of friendship, resilience, and self-discovery woven throughout. It’s a joy to watch these characters grow while exploring the multiverse.Gameplay is a blast, combining fluid platforming with creative, over-the-top weaponry that keeps every encounter fresh. The DualSense controller’s haptics and adaptive triggers elevate the experience, making every shot and movement feel tactile and immersive.While the story isn’t groundbreaking, it’s executed so well that it’s hard not to get swept up in the adventure. The pacing is spot-on, and the blend of humor, action, and emotional moments makes it an unforgettable ride.. This objectively has the best gameplay in the series with some of the worst dialogue in the series. It's a game I love on mute. The R2 motion is cool.. this game is very good, but it failed on nthe inovation on the villains and game play, but is a action must play.. Very impressive, the worlds are teeming with details, the story is quite entertaining and the gameplay is great. A great game. Incredibly detalied graphics, fun game mechanics and good haptic feedback on the controller. After I played this game I tried the Ratchet game from 2016 and was stunned by how much graphics quality advanced in 5 years between the two titles. It’s going to be tough waiting for the next title in this series which comes out around 2029. On the other side, this one is replay worthy game, sothe wait will be much easier.. Visually, the game is very impressive, highly responsive, and really takes full advantage of the speed that the PS5 offers. However, I found the story rather uninteresting, and in my view, it seems the creators tailored it to accommodate the introduction of Rivet, a new, feminist character who takes centre stage for much of the game. The narrative largely revolves around Rivet, who is portrayed as being more capable than Ratchet. There’s nothing inherently wrong with focusing on Rivet, but the issue lies in the way it was advertised, which gave a different impression. There was no need for the new character to overshadow Ratchet.. very good and must play game, best experience with dualsense controller thank you for the good game sony. Epic as always. I wouldn't say it's a breakthrough of the PS5 console, it's not even a breakthrough of the Ratchet & Clank series, but nevertheless, it's a blast adventure, packed with good action, good graphics and good characters.. 8.5/10 story, music 10/10, gameplay 9/10, visual 10/10, performance 10/10, value 9/10, short game but I still enjoyed my time playing it. What a masterpiece from start to end. Insomniac never dissapoint with these titles!. With ratchet and clank being my favorite ps2 franchise I’m happy to say that this is the first game to surpass the fun of the third game.. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a visually stunning entry point for newcomers like me to the series. It offers a fun and flashy introduction with impressive graphics and smooth gameplay. However, it can become repetitive after a while, with the combat and platforming lacking variety. Despite this, it’s an enjoyable experience and a solid introduction to the Ratchet & Clank universe.. And yet another game destroyed by modern accessibility **** not explore, we will mark everything on the map for you.A puzzle? Do not think by yourself, the annoying character in turn will keep telling you exactly what to do, even before you try once.Huge auto tracking for hits.Difficulty modes that do not matter a single thing, i do not understand why game has ""difficulty modes"" if you can freely change it without consequences in the same playthru... Whats the point?Awful cheesy writing, dumb dialogues, uninterested plots. And the villain, Jesus Crist... so dumb and cringe.Everything is so dull, so anodyne. **** has good graphics with 60fps, that's the only good thing of the game.. Amazing game, it showcases the PS5 at its finest. While this game is not breaking any standards it’s beautiful to watch and so much fun to play.. Showcasing true power of PS5. unique gameplay. good story. one of the best experiences on PS5.. I felt like I was in a cartoon movie. This is a game that most people can enjoy. Everything about this game was good, the story the gameplay, the universe the graphics the musics... You are truly playing a animated movie ! Well done insomniac !. Visually it is a spectacle, both in the artistic design and in the graphic section. As for the gameplay, it feels light, comfortable and with a wide variety of weapons that are each more interesting. On PC I have experienced some FPS drops at certain times. In short, a very fun, entertaining and recommended game.. As a fan of the Ratchet & Clank series from childhood, I would argue that this game is weaker compared to the other astonishing entries. First off, the game looks jaw-dropping and handles pretty well on PS5. The movements and controller feedback are nice too. However, there are some drawbacks to this entry. These are mainly the story and the weapons. The story has the depth of what you would expect from a kid's game and the characters introduced did not connect with me. About the weapons, there are many weapons to choose from and there are cool ones among them. However, none puts me in a state where I am amazed by how intricate the weapon is. One example of those amazing weapons is the Groovitron (the disco ball weapon). Overall though, the game is clean and enjoyable to go through from start to finish.. Nice game with good duel sense experience, solid story with solid game play. In the illustrious pantheon of gaming franchises, ""Ratchet & Clank"" has long stood as a beacon of creativity and fun. However, with the latest installment, ""Rift Apart,"" it seems the series has hit a snag, not in terms of visual spectacle, but in the realms of innovation and gameplay depth. Lackluster Innovation First and foremost, ""Rift Apart"" feels like a missed opportunity in innovation. Despite the introduction of rift mechanics, the game rarely ventures beyond the surface level of this potentially game-changing feature. The rifts, which could have revolutionized platforming and combat, often feel like mere gimmicks rather than integral gameplay elements. Predictable Storytelling The narrative, usually a strong suit for the series, unfolds in a predictable manner with few surprises. The new characters, while visually appealing, lack the depth and development to make players truly care about their fates. The story feels like a retread of familiar themes, leaving one to wonder if the franchise is running out of original ideas. Repetitive Gameplay Gameplay, the core of any game, suffers from repetition in ""Rift Apart."" The initial thrill of new weapons and gadgets quickly fades as players find themselves funneled through similar combat scenarios and puzzles. The challenge seems artificially inflated by increasing enemy health rather than introducing new mechanics or strategies. Technical Glitches While the game is a technical marvel on the PlayStation 5, showcasing incredible load times and graphical fidelity, it is not immune to glitches. These technical hiccups can momentarily pull players out of the immersive experience, reminding them of the game's imperfections. Conclusion: A Rift Too Far? ""Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart"" is undoubtedly a visual masterpiece, a showcase of the PlayStation 5's capabilities. Yet, beneath the glossy exterior lies a game struggling to find its footing in innovation and gameplay depth. It leans too heavily on its laurels, offering a familiar experience when it had the potential to redefine the series. In their next adventure, one hopes Ratchet and Clank find not just new worlds to explore, but new gameplay horizons to conquer.. One of the greatest game I've ever played. So much details, marvelous graphics ,animations, details, dialogues gameplay and character designs. This game delivers everything you want and need. Insomniac games never disappoints.. I LOOOOVE IT! AGAIN! This one is even better than the previous! I miss these kind of games, where you have fun and want to play again….Thank you for another amazing game! I love their adventures! Keep em coming but dont change it too much :D. Quite possibly the best family game on PS5, other than It Takes Two. The story and gameplay were phenomenal and the game design and inventive weaponry was amazing. Highly recommended!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is my first time playing this franchise, and I have to say it's a fun game. It has wonderful graphics, the art is cool, I play this game from PS Plus Extra, overall the gameplay is fun, the narrative is OK; you must stop villain of the day,the music, I think, is not bad, but neither iconic. the introduction of a new character and gameplay is a low point, and I don't like that; it is the same as the main character in all things. my final score is 7/10.. Pros - the game looks gorgeous - massive open levels with plenty to collect - 20 weapons to rip through this game - new movement options that feel fun - lovable characters // Cons - 2 out of the 20 weapons are only available on NG+ so they are going to be pointless to 90% of the people playing this game // Rift Apart is a great continuation of the previous entry. Introducing a bunch of new weapons, enemies, traversal methods and not overstaying its welcome by being a 100+ hour affair makes it a perfect palate cleanser between larger releases. The newly added weapons like the Ricochet and Topiary sprinkler add more ways to engage with the hordes of enemies bearing down on you. Add to that the new dash and rocket boots and you are going to be zipping around while blowing up everything in your way. Rift Appart is a fun addition to your collection because it feels like a blast from the past and you will not regret owning it.. Combat is great, the different weapons and the upgrading system is great. Especially like the arena part.. I have not played Ratchet & Clank since the old days, and maybe my joy for these types of games dwindled. However it was fun, but too easy, and sort of cheesy. Another great entry in the series. Love the new characters and the worlds are super fun to explore. Great collection of weapons to use as well.. this might be my favorite Ratchet and Clank game ever made everything just great and feels great from the story and characters to the exploration and setting of the various planets, to the weapons and how they handled in combat this is an amazing game and definitely, a must play for fans of the series and an amazing place to start the series. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Looks amazing, very good gameplay and fun story until the end. Various and fun guns to play around with.. Another game infiltrated by boring no talent feminists. Stuffing their whiny agenda into everything. If anything all the female inserts, as always, are **** hilarious! . They really have no idea how much we laugh at them behind their backs. All while they march around pretending to win. Oh well. At least I didn’t pay for this. The gameplay isn’t bad. The story is **** looks good. Runs well minus the sound disappearing sometimes.. As a ratchet and clank fan i can say that im so glad they went to continue with the story instead of staying on that crappy reebot they made a few years ago. Holy this game is one of my favorite rachet and clank games great story especially introducing these new characters kit is a absolute great character Ican't wait for the next game the adaptive triggers feel good but adaptive Triggers really aren'tmy thing but overall gameplay is great man just buy this game or if your on PS5 its on ps+. This game was really good and wasn't one of those crappy sequels. It had Dr. Nefarious like the W villain. I'd give it an 88-89%. a perfect showcase of the lovable ratchet & clank formula i enjoyed as a child and surprisingly for demonstrating the PS5's various capabilities. my only wish is that it was longer, way too short.. As a lifelong fan of the franchise, I came into Rift Apart on the back of the disappointing reboot (2016), hoping for a return to the original trilogy's personality, whimsical humour, and strong writing. Although the graphics, core gameplay design, and sheer size of the planets we visit dwarf what's come before it, the issues plaguing the series still show their rear end here. Pros: Spectacular introduction sequence treading both new and familiar grounds, with excellent use of the dimensionator to create high octane action set pieces, and nostalgic call backs to previous entries in the Series. The core gameplay loop is strengthened with heightened verticality,(jump pads, tether teleport), speed of movement (dash ability, speed boots, great to control, amazing haptic feedback), and a few wonderful guns that make make good use of adaptive triggers (aiming grenades, ricochet, sniper). The graphics fully demonstrate what the PS5 is capable of, with beautiful visuals, full of vibrant colours, jaw dropping vistas, great animations. The level design is at it's greatest in the large open areas (Savali - lombax lores, Blizar Prime - engineer drills) with fun traversal mechanics, and continuing with the Future series staple of collectathon secondary objectives. There are also fun hidden rifts interspersed within each level, focusing on puzzle platformingand harkening to the series roots. Cons: Story, character writing, and dialogue, we retread familiar ground with the lombax storyline, the characters do NOT bounce off one another organically, the dialogue is dull and provides no insight into how the main characters differ from one another. Rivet is provided more screen time than Ratchet, but displays the exact same traits; she's optimistic, kind, adventurous, and determined, whereas Kit is always second guessing himself, because he used to be a warbot? Even up to the final mission he still runs the ""noooo, I'm scawee, stay away, I am useless"" like brudda you've done plenty to help out and can trust the others, quit being useless, very poor from Insomniac, please return to the quick-witted, sharp intelligent writing of the original trilogy. The main story is forgettable, and so too the villain, never seen Nefarious this neutered, he isn't menacing, he isn't funny, he isn't even crazy, please leave him behind and make a new original villain. As far as Gameplay flaws, repeating the same enemies and mini bosses over and over again, coupled with backtracking to planets we've already explored and completed, leads to a far weaker final third of the game. Other smaller issues that do add up are the terrible ""hacking"" minigames with Glitch, oh wow we should really break up the monotony of shooting things, with a hacking sequence, where you go around shooting things, well done! The soundtrack here is a massive downgrade compared to the original, the arena contains the same repetitive environments with weak objectives, the humour is toddler friendly, the alternate dimension personalities lack creativity and imagination, and not including a giant Kit set pieces really blows after that great initial reveal. Finally, the vast majority of guns operate too similarly, lightning Vs Buzzsar, Agents of doom Vs Mr Zurkon, there's no lava gun, sheepinator, blue electric whip, and several weapons become very weak against end game enemies, meaning you'll resort to the same 3-4 in the final few stages.. Played on PC Ratchet and Clank: A Rift Apart is a spectacle in every sense, with gameplay that is perfected to the extreme and incredible visual quality. The port could be better optimized, but it is still a pleasure to play. The story delves a little deeper than these games usually do, which is appreciated. However, it is still not a game with many pretensions. It is fun, it looks good, and that is enough.. -5/10 story -7/10 gameplay -8/10 environments -5/10 characters -7/10 music. I played it in 2023 so in two years after release. So I didn't see any PS5 magic. It's mostly very similar to the previous game released in 2016. Of course, graphics is better but probably that's it. That PS5-only-through-dimensions loading happened a few times per game and these episodes could be just pre-rendered ones. Anyway it is a good game with a nice story, perfect graphics, and easy (I was killed by enemies zero(!!!) times throughout the game at medium difficulty) but entertaining gameplay. It's not a system seller but a good game which I recommend to play while it is in PSplus.. I couldn't put this game down 10/10. The exploration is so fun with collectibles in each level and fun ways to get around.. I hate this game. Positives, presentation and graphics 11/10, gameplay is a refinement over the last game and opens up much more fun. Action sequences are amazing fun and very impressive until overused. But wow. I like ratchet and clank. This game.. the end boss is difficult by hiding from you, and you only end up beating it because it gave up and turns into easy mode after a number of attempts. There are no mention at all about relationships in this game until a npc introduces themselves offers to have a bisexual relationship with you or your robot, disappears, and is never heard from again. In a childrens game. The most explored theme in the game is parallels to real world mental problems for children. no kidding. I like alot the character of rivet, but they made her an angry btch right before the end for no idea. Then you beat the boss. The characters go home, and it ends. That's literally it. As a lifelong gamer i feel insulted i wasted my time on this. I wouldn't care about any of the above if there was half the narrative in rift apart as in the ps4 game. But there isn't. Im pretty sure my next console will be an xbox.. Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is a truly engaging, exciting, action packed game starring charismatic and beloved characters in the series. Combat is exceptional, providing a plethora of unique and immensely useful weapons, each providing a purpose in battle. Alongside the noteworthy implementation of the Dualsense, each weapon sounds and feels distinct from one another, immersing the gamer in the game even further. The visuals are awe-inspiring, with further innovations, such as VRR and Ray Tracing present. The only downside of the game is lack of enemy variety and bosses, often cycling the same few bosses and enemy types, at least until the end. Beyond that, this game is a masterpiece, available on Ps Plus. A must play if you own a PS5.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I love the game! It's so nice, Rivet as a charakter is fantastic, and of course are Ratched and Clank great. The story is cool and the weapons are cool too.. Love the franchise, I have beaten every game, even the cellphone one. But I didn't connect with this one much, maybe I'm tired, maybe I'm growing old. I'd like the series to take a different turn, something like a Jak II.. Story: I find the story somewhat enjoyable, but felt like there could of been more to this long awaited series. I find it really disappointing that there was no difference in using rivet and ratchet. I also feel like it was a roller-coaster of accepting of who you are instead of the main plot of the story stopping the rifts and finding the lombaxes. The game could of did more and better but it chose to move people's hearts instead of moving along with the story. Gameplay: I would say the gameplay feels smooth and fun. I find it incredibly absorbing and addictive. Guns/Combat: I find the combat as creative and addicting as to be expected from the ratchet and clank series. There is no surprise at all here. Don't worry that is a good thing. It is a system that needs no changes. The combat feels fluid and fun. I really feel like the weapons were suited for a longer story. Lenght: The lenght of the story for the ratchet and clank game was very short. I feel that the game ended so quickly, you barely got any upgrades left for your gun. You should have a max out arsenal at the end of the story. Instead of farming crystals over and over again just to max out all your weapons at the arena. I find that incredibly disappointing for a ratchet and clank Game. Why I give it a 5: I expected everything from a ratchet and clank game. I would instantly give it a 10 if it wasn't for the short story, pointless life lesson conversation from characters. Rift system that takes a whole animation to do in battle instead of it being instant. I had no problem ignoring them, unless I needed to get to a high location story wise and not combat wise. It was useless. I expected to be fling out of battle to a new location constant. It felt way too tame for a destructive unpredictable Rift transfer. No risk of going to a new place or new area. No gravity or risk when using the rifts. Are you marketing the ssd of the ps5 or are the rifts a must have for the game. Insomniac WHAT ARE YOU DOING?. Note: I don't mind the new lombax eventually we would start meeting more of them, but if this is just to market a female character as the recent flow of their series with spiderman and miles and so on without it being a natural part of the story and lore of the game. Then I gotta say I am mighty disappointed in you Insomniac.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My favorite childhood game is on the ps5 & I'm just loving it. The gameplay & the weapons rotation feels a lot like the previous games, graphics are so much better, the characters play well in this game but I do feel like is missing the more funny moments like in up your arsenal or going commando. The story was amazing & I'm loving how they introduce us a new character. It's not challenging what's so ever so even kids can enjoy. All tho I personally don't think this is the best R&C, it is still a really awesome game.. Eh. It isn't bad, but it isn't anything great either. Really just an inoffensive game that doesn't do anything wrong necessarily but it doesn't really make the game any better than it is. The game in my opinion just seems very short though for the outrageous price tag.. I never got into the ratchet and clank games, but this game blew me away. It truly harnesses the ps5 to give us a next generation game. I feel like this is the standard we've dreamed of games getting to in terms of visuals and performance.. Super fun and addictive. Insomniac studios is steady out here dropping banger after banger. Rockstar, naughty dog, Santa Monica, Insomniac, **** punch are the goats of story driven games. Ratchet and clank rift apart is a simple but still a well told story. An absolute must play, Insomniac is all u need to hear to know it's a must play, it's that easy.. One of the best Ratchet and Clank games I played on PC, the performance/optimization is a bit lacking but it only depends on the destruction of course. Hopefully they'll added previous Ratchet and Clank games on PC. Wonderful game by Insomniac Games, for the franchise's fans is a very good game. The Way The The Game Flows And How Insomniac Handled The Transitions Is Incredibly Fun.. Great animation movie level graphics, cute design. I didn't like the story. Pretty cliche. Gameplay, and level design felt heavily like I am playing a kid game. If you like the genre, I can recommend. But if the gameplay videos or trailers cant get you excited, you can just pass, or you can give it a try during discount. A beautiful update to the series. Introduces some colorful new characters and gives the player a plethora of fantastic weapons!. wow, just wow. like a playable pixar movie. and the gameplay is very fun too, 20 really creative guns. +cool story. runs well on my 5 year old rtx 2080. One of the most fun and visually impressive games I've played.. Tech demo with fancy lighting and scripted sequences every 10 minutes. Story isn't even worth the performance issues. You know the devs aren't even confident in their own gameplay when you can skip entire 'puzzle' segments and get a 2 sentence sum up of what you're missing if you skip it.. It's a good game but that's about it.. Gameplay : 8 Graphics : 9 Story : 8 Sound : 7 **********************************************************************************Overall : 8. Game with decent animation graphics, as well as being very fun for all ages. The story I thought was reasonably good. Gameplay with weapons very fluid and interesting. Dimension system is something to marvel at. The game's negative points are BUGS, the first time playing I didn't have that much of a problem, but on the second playthrough I had several bugs in the stages, but no Crashes. Besides its flaws, it delivers what it promises.. Insomniac Games has played a significant role in showcasing the capabilities of the PlayStation and contributing to its success. ""Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart"" is an incredibly enjoyable game that introduces innovative features to fully leverage the power of the PS5. While the story is decent but not particularly groundbreaking, it remains enjoyable. The true highlight of the game is the gameplay. It's exhilarating, fast-paced, and offers a wide array of weapons for players to enjoy. The graphics are stunning, and the absence of load times is a remarkable **** utilization of the rift mechanics was a unique aspect of the game, although it may have been underutilized, especially in terms of enhancing combat and traversal, leaving room for more creative potential. Additionally, the traversal mechanics seemed somewhat simplistic and could have been more diverse and engaging.. An absolutely stunning game. the worst gameplay-wise, this game feels mediocre and rushed, Sony disappointing the community, unfortunately there will be those who defend this crap because we only had one game this year. Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is the long-awaited installment of one of my favorite game series. I am deeply grateful to Insomniac Games for not letting this series fade into obscurity like Jak and Sly did. This game offers an all-around fantastic adventure with breathtaking animations and enjoyable gunplay, accompanied by exciting platforming segments. However, it must be noted that the game is relatively **** weapons are funny and creatively designed, and the levels and enemies are crafted with great attention to detail. Nevertheless, there is a lack of variety among the enemies, and the boss fights could have been more diverse and numerous. In general, the game's overall content, especially the endgame content, is rather sparse. The arena could have been more diverse and extensive, similar to its **** for the narrative, I didn't have very high expectations. The story and characters are charming and often humorous, but at times, they all behave a bit too friendly, as if they were guests in ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse."" I missed the more cynical and occasionally more mature portrayal of characters and humor.. This game might be the best PS5 exclusive so far (until of course spider man 2). the gameplay is addictive and it uses the DualSense PERFECTLY. This game is fun and great but it does have problems.. The first next gen experience. What a fun game. Theres nothing bad to say about this game.. This is easily the best 3D platformer I have ever played. The story is gripping, the characters are fantastic, the gameplay is top-notch, graphics and performance are unmatched, the voice acting is incredible and the game is full of new, innovative ideas. You literally couldn’t ask for a better 3D platformer. It’s a shame that Insomniac is spending so much time with Marvel stuff and forgetting about this franchise (for now). Hopefully they will continue this story and its characters in the near future.. This game is so much fun, I love being able to use many different weapons and styles to defeat enemies, beautiful game as well. What a game!!! I've really appreciated all things in this game. The last part is worth of any great advertising and people deserve to live it.. Amazing game! Even if it seems like a child game, it's and amazing shooter!. Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is a really beautiful third person shooter created by Insomniac. The premise of the game is that the titular Clank has built a weapon/item called the Dimensionator, by which Ratchet, the last Lombax – the other titular protagonist – can go and find the other Lombaxes, who fled from his dimension to other dimensions. Dr. Nefarious – Ratchet and Clank’s perennial foe – shows up to steal the Dimensionator, resulting in the duo (plus Nefarious himself) being catapulted into an alternate universe, ruled by EMPEROR Nefarious, a more competent and charismatic alternate universe version of Dr. Nefarious who has conquered the gal","the main problem i had with it was the amount of game breaking bugs . the game excels in presentation and gameplay, but the story feels a bit predictable and lacks the emotional depth needed to truly stand out . despite these shortcomings, Rift Apart is still a fantastic experience ."
563.Rogue Legacy 2,"Rogue Legacy 2 is a wonderful, beautiful, crazy-hard-and-yet-not-at-the-same-time game. I can hardly stop playing it long enough to finish writing this review. It is hard to find flaws in this game without resorting to extreme nit-picking. Every aspect of it just oozes polish. The replayability is off the charts, even after you finally reach the ending. Even if roguelikes/rogue-lites or metroidvanias scare you for their reputation of being too hard for the average gamer, play this one. It absolutely deserves a spot right up there with the best of them, including its genre’s namesakes. You may have never heard of Cellar Door Games unless you played the original Rogue Legacy, but I truly and honestly believe you owe it to yourself to give it a try.. Rogue Legacy 2 offers so many options when it comes to classes, upgrades, and ways to play it that anyone remotely open to the roguelite genre should check it out. I might have asked for a bit more direction in how to approach certain upgrade paths since the volume of choices can be borderline overwhelming, but it’s a minor quibble when everything else about the game is so fantastic. Rogue Legacy 2’s memorable world and overflowing personality will keep you invested until the very end.. My new favorite rouge like. I can't wait to see what is next from Cellar Door.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Rogue Legacy 2 is a worthy heir to the 2013 original and solidifies the legacy left by one of the best examples of what a roguelike/Metroidvania is. Its difficulty may put some players off, but don't be fooled, Rogue Legacy 2 is highly addictive, deep and fun.. Rogue Legacy 2 is an enormous beast of an adventure, packed with fast combat, great platforming and endless replayability. It’s the kind of game that can be actively difficult to stop playing, with the spoils from one run opening up new opportunities in the next that can be difficult to resist checking out. While progress can be slow it rarely turns into a grind, with most hits and the inevitable death of the current hero feeling fair and avoidable if only you’d been just a bit more skilled. The generations come and go with each one sacrificing a member to castle and lands beyond, but the family obsession burns through the ages and makes it easier for the next descendant to go further and become stronger. It may take countless millennia to learn all the castle’s secrets, but seeing as it’s almost impossible to walk away from the quest, they’re bound to be unraveled some day.. All of this makes Rogue Legacy 2 difficult to put down. The ""one more run"" effect is in full force as you choose yet another new heir to embark on another perilous journey. The introduction of distinct classes with their own unique weapons is a masterstroke that elevates this sequel by building on what was already a fantastic premise and satisfying roguelite loop. House Rules make it more palatable for a wider audience but also give players an opportunity to tailor the challenge to their liking, even if that means increasing the difficulty. The breadth of its biomes can sometimes induce backtracking as you search for the path forward, but this is a minor blemish on what is a fantastic game. Sacrificing your family tree has never felt so good.. Rogue Legacy 2 learns from its lineage and presents a superb sequel with a huge amount of depth of content. With so much replayability and meaningful progression, the game will have players hooked on its delightful gameplay loop for hours upon hours. Built with both style and substance, Rogue Legacy 2 is a tremendous success for fans of the original and the genre. It may not be a game for everyone, but for those willing to take up the challenge, a truly splendid journey awaits.. As you might expect, such breadth comes at the cost of a little finesse. [Issue#372, p.104]. Fun, very diverse, beautiful visual style, addictive gameplay, adequate challenge and just a great game.. Unfortunately, too much of everything does not automatically make a better game. Some character classes are practically useless or extremely week compared to others. In later NG+ playthroughs, the grinding aspects gets annoying. In addition, many enemies have similar moves to those in the regular game, except that you sometimes die after just 2 hits, depending on the character class and trait. Less would sometimes have been more here. I prefer RL1.. Rogue Legacy 2 starts off very badly. The game is obviously quite hard, but some mechanics, like collision damage and directional damage, can throw you off from the game. But something keeps reeling you back in: the levelling system. You can level a character to Narnia and turn them into an unstoppable beast, but to get to that level you'll need to grind a lot of money, The boss fights are well realized, and some characters are fun to play as, but most of them are embarrassingly sloppy (Mage, Ronin).. I was a big fan of the first Rogue Legacy and am pretty soundly disappointed with the follow-up. The original came out almost 10 years ago and the formula has seen virtually no improvement. It's truly shocking how little the devs seemed to have learned from making the first game, and how little they gleaned from the subsequent 10 years of rogue games becoming streamlined and dominant. Playing Rogue Legacy 2 feels like playing a 10 year old game, and not in a good way.. For all the improvement’s cellar door has made to polish, platforming and more diverse enemies…, the inescapable fact is that combat is still boring due to the 1 note brain-dead moronic enemies that dominate this game. And when they add in out of balance, hard, mid-level enemies, they just spam attacks in an unfair way because that’s the “tension”…. That actually demonstrates lack of combat design more than anything else. The fundamentals of combat are still boring. That’s the core gameplay. That part is boring & archaic. Not much different from Ghouls n Ghosts 1000’s of years ago. Still I really appreciate all the player friendly options like choosing enemy health, turning off enemy contact damage, stopping level randomisation….","it's hard to find flaws in this game without resorting to extreme nit-picking . the replayability is off the charts, even after you finally reach the end . it's a worthy heir to the 2013 original and solidifies the legacy left by one of the best examples of what a roguelike/metroidvania is ."
565.The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition,"This game is an amazing adventure game filled with humor and character. The remaster is also well done with the voice acting add on being a very good addition in my opinion. But it's nice that you can switch back to the original and have a look at it.. Simply best point and click game ever. The OST from Michael Land is best OST ever. This is a must have all time classic masterpiece.. Monkey Island 1 i 2 in once package..lots of fun, puzzlez and one of the greatest story ever told in video games! I rate it 10/10. Monkey Island is a classic that breathes new life into the original from the 90 's. It has great humour, well done music and is one of the most memorable games I have ever played. It has the option to switch between the retro and new graphics, which appeals to both old and new people to the genre. However, the old graphics leave more room for imagination and the game technically has a built-in walk-through which ruins the game as it is to hard to resist, and should not be pressed until you are truly stuck. Regardless, The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is definitely worth full price.. This is how point and click adventures work. It has logical puzzles, wonderful writing, and some of the best characters in video games. This game must be bought!. WARNING BIAS REVIEW! this was probably the first game I played when i was young. Playing this on my Amiga 500 with the 4 Floppy Discs (Remember them?) and constantly having to change as you moved from area to area. I found the scripting and the humour to be subtle but charming and the characters to be well thought up. The game now available is still the same old game that you remember but they have taken a few bits from the later series and put them into the new. The voice actors from the third game (Curse of monkey Island i think) has been brought in to voice the characters and they have given the game a new lick of paint. You can however change this back to the original with the push of a button. Point and click games are back with this and games such as 'The Walking Dead'. this is not quite where it all began but it is the most successful of the early breed of Point and Click adventures and what really gave the new modern games the audience they have today. Play this and tell me if you don't want to go Insult Sword Fighting... How Appropriate, you fight like a cow.. Point and click adventure with a great sense of humour. I very much like how you have the option to switch between old and new graphics. Be warned that this game is hard and can be frustrating if you become stumped.","the OST from Michael Land is best OST ever . this is a must have all time classic masterpiece . it has great humour, well done music and is one of the most memorable games i have ever played ."
566.Project Gotham Racing 3,"Pioneer in its genre with circuit in real streets. He gave a kick in graphics, speed and gameplay to PS3 Gran Turismo. Continuing the series from the original Xbox, all the improvements you'd expect are present and correct, the kudos system of progression works well for all skill levels and the handling is a really nice blend of simulation and arcade fun. Still one of the best racers on the Xbox, even now.. Beautiful graphics, nice city design and great driving fun. A must have for every racing fan! Overall rating: 8.9.. Project Gotham Racing 3 is one of the best racing games ever made. Absolute Gem. What do i say about this game, i don't mind simulation racers, i prefer arcade, but simulation is fun aswell, however this game ****, it's all slow paced, stiff and souless.. PGR3 was good but not better than its predecessor. Graphics obviously got upgraded since it was on the 360 but over all it fell flat compared to PGR2 but it was still good.. Quite possibly the best racer ever released for the Xbox 360, and a launch title at that. The game's visuals are impressive even in 2020, some 15 years after launch, and regardless of whether you're playing with a pad or a stock 360 controller, the game is both sublime to drive and the AI puts up an extremely good fight. Bizarre Creations gambled with including a vehicle roster of only the fastest supercars and concept cars in the world at the time, and it results in being able to drive cars that in some cases never appeared in another video game ever again - such as the Ford Indigo or GT90. The lone issue holding the game back is the track selection; just five locations are available, and both Vegas and New York feature generally uninteresting layouts.. PGR 3 is a decent entry in the franchise,considering how bad the first 2 were. PGR 3 has good handling **** cars all feel different to each other.There is a small selection of tracks,but can create your own tracks.This is a very welcome **** is a significant lack of cars though. PGR 3 has aged pretty well since it's release in 2005,and it looked incredible at the time. PGR 3's biggest sin is how uninspired and dull the career mode is.There is no spark,nothing to get it going. PGR 3's sound design is great,but the soundtrack is uninspired PGR 3 has a lot going for it,but the lack of content,boring career,and poor soundtrack hold it back.. PGR3 is a solid racing game that looks beautiful, plays well, but lacks depth, preventing this game from reaching the heights that PGR2 achieved. With a short campaign, somewhat lower car choice, almost nothing that really stands out, PGR3 does seem like a racing game not worth your money, but its absolutely beautiful graphics, decent music, and… just fascinating level editor makes it a game that you pretty much have to get if you’re a fan of somewhat realistic racing games. I feel that the PGR series is a good mix of arcade racing action and Forza Motorsport-esque realism. One more thing - the level editor is just really cool. It’s the first and last (for some reason) time that a PGR game has gotten a level editor. While the choices aren’t really infinite, the fact that you can make a custom track in any city you want is pretty darn cool. Gameplay: 9/10 Story: N/A/10 Music: 8/10 Presentation: 9/10 Length: 7/10 Overall: 8/10. Graphics: 9.0 Sound: 8.0 Gameplay: 8.5 Fun/Story: 8.2 A nice way to start with Xbox360. Great graphics and good gameplay (i would prefer less arcade and more realistic but after all that´s the world of Forza).. A fun enough game for the start of a consoles life but has since been overshadowed by many games. The two things I remember, beyond the fun drifting, was the terrible out of game interface and how the car design/graphics didn't seem to fit with the background art/graphics, it's like the cars and backgrounds were made by different teams and they both look good but just don't really mix together. Overall this game was only worth playing back when it was released.. PGR 3 is a game witch I got from my first Xbox and played it about once, maybe twice then it stayed in my pail of games for 5 to 6 years. Until one day I found it and I had to play it. So did it not deserve the years of been left at the bottom of the pile? Not been a fan of racing games, but this is a realy good game. Good selection of cars, both good and bad. Some great tracks and none of them are bad. Gameplay is pretty good but time to time annoying. Overall really good and sorry if this review is crap, never reviewed a racing game before. Project Gotham Racing 3 8.1/10. My first PGR game (played MSR on Dreamcast before). A very good arcade game, good graphics, great cars ... just a cool game that takes some skill to master - Epic drifts !. This game defines what makes a good RACING game. It's all about precision. Hardcore difficulty requires you to be better than abosolutely perfect. Very difficult, very fun, challenging but rewarding. No customisation, no assists. How it should be. A fair playing field, with the better cars require more car control skill. It is very fun to drive for both drifting and precision with a lot less focus on racing against the AI. If you're the kind of gamer who wants a game which is all about visuals and holding down the trigger rather than apex-perfect precision, than avoid this. If you want pure racing with fantastic driving mechanics which is purely centred around perfection, this is the best racing game EVER. Let's not forget that PGR 3 was released with the Xbox 360 in November 2005. And what a game. It was the first truly 7th generation racing game. It features party modes (as seen in DiRT 3) for a good mess with friends, split-screen local gameplay, a career mode, achievements, medals and a variety of modes & tracks for TrueSkill ranked matchmaking. Everything is pretty much perfectly designed- difficulty, driving physics, graphics, controls, cars, tracks, multiplayer (including tournaments), interior view (which not many games had at the time and even still not all do now) etc. Not only is this game flawless in everything it tries to, it's also a benchmark setter. The sense of speed and the graphics of interior car view still remain unmatched even by Forza 4.. I have only owned this game for about two weeks, and I have to say that it is one of the best racing games I have played. Despite only have 80 cars as opposed to Project Gotham Racing 2's 100+, these cars are not only the rarest, but also have a great amount of detail. The real improvement to the series was the addition of the interior camera. It adds so much depth to the game, because now you can't necessarily see the next corner as clearly as an outside view. The photo mode is also a cool edition, you can get some really good shots. The only reason this game doesn't get a 10/10 is because of the music selection and the limited amount of cars. I hope to soon get Project Gotham 4 and do a hopefully positive review on that.. This was one of the original launch games for the Xbox 360 and people used it to prove how good the console could make games look. First off, while it does look pretty good, I felt like the game itself was complete garbage. Everyone got the same car, the fastest one in the game, and raced it over and over and it was awful online. The single player was the most repetitive and uninteresting modes around. I'm usually not so harsh on a game, but this one is just no fun at all.","beautiful graphics, nice city design and great driving fun . lone issue holding the game back is the track selection; just five locations are available . kudos system of progression works well for all skill levels ."
567.NBA 2K17,"I've heard people say this is the most ""Overrated 2K"" ever, meanwhile 2K20 exists but that's neither here nor there. Was this game perfect? Of course not. The player models could be better, but outside of that this game for me has aged like wine. The soundtrack was good, the gameplay reminds me of modern day NBA oddly enough, My Career felt realistic for once, and this was the first time they added Expansion teams into My League. I know many people mention the ""Paul George loading screen"", but for me I was there for the day one release and never had this.. NBA 2K17 was and still is the GREATEST NBA 2K game of all time. The graphics are still incredible. The soundtrack is still incredible. 2K17 has my favorite gameplay. Every other NBA 2K game before AND after just pales in comparison to NBA 2K17. I will forever cherish and miss the good times I had when this game first came out.. The last great 2K game, everything after this one is just horrible and not worth your time.. one of the most purely fun 2ks, the last GREAT game in the franchise. stealing is way too easy tho. The last great MyCareer ever, along with a awesome MyTeam, and the best gameplay in a 2K game ever. In my opinion, 2K17 is the greatest 2K ever made.. This is my favorite 2k of all time. this game was great and was almost perfect besides a few bugs like the loading screen. This game is great. The story is solid(None of that Vic Van Lier nonsense). Player Mechanics are smooth, like how the player handles the ball. The shooting and rebounding mechanics are great too. Small details like the Jerseys are amazing too. My only gripe is some of the mechanics. It should not be that complicated to substitute players in and out. I’m not trying to fly a rocket I’m trying to put Jimmy Butler in lol. The soundtrack is amazing, I can tell they really put there time in instead of just putting in the most popular song at the time like 2k’s now. I’m not that impressed with the graphics though. It seems like every year 2k gets worst with the graphics instead of better. From 2K17 on it seems like where getting worst graphics. MyTeam is alright even though I don’t really indulge in that often. MyLeague is Grade A. You can pretty much do anything you want. 2K17 is going to be a game we talk about in 10 years and miss.. This game is awful in the career their is no controls on how the players pass to you but I like the graphics and the game play. Stop monetize career mode. Monetize multiplayer not carrer mode. Too greedy, own nba2k18 3 day return for 2k17 plan on selling this for 2k16 or 2k15, this is what happen when there are no contest in one franchise. Greed took charge. They follow in their line, the best sports game, but the shots from afar in the park get in from either side.. that has to be improved.... I enjoyed 2K16 a lot so I was happy for 2K17 but I am shocked that the game is pretty much the same just with a different roster. So it is good as a Basketball-Game by itself but as a successor I am pretty disappointed.. Another solid Basketball Sim. I enjoyed the time I put into it, but wow what a lot of time it was. As with all sports games you need to invest a vast amount of hours before you really get under the surface. I played for weeks and didn't even get through the first season of MyCareer. That aside, 2K17 looks great and plays just as well. Let me be clear this is a Sim and has no arcadey feel to it at all There is tons of content here and as far as Basketball games this is by far, I'll say it again, by far the best on the market. If you have the time.. This was a fine game before the patches. The gameplay was good and the different modes could keep you occupied for a long time. The patches messed up the gameplay a lot and has made it annoying to play. All 2k seems to care about is their user buying the next game. GRADE: C+. Nba 2k17 is very fun to play if you give it a chance even though basketball is not very big in the Uk the game development is extraordinarily good the aspects of this game I like is My park and Pro-am these two are particularly very enjoyable My park is when you go head to head in a basketball match with people from different part of the world like America Spain Portugal etc. the thing I most enjoy of this particular mod is you have different level for example the worst level is rookies which people tend to hate playing with as they have no IQ of how the game works the second stage after you reach rookie 5 is all-star then after that is superstar and after that is legend me personally I was superstar another aspect of this is you can choose who you play with for example you might have a squad which is another word for teammates specifically on this game there are different “courts” on this game e.g. 1v1 2v2 3v3 and even 4v4 you can also i play competitively on something called stage where you play for VC (virtual currency) making it more interesting and upping the stakes you can also make a clan which I have got when I use to play this game this game was definitely one of my favorites the other game mode you can play is pro-am this game type is where you go head to head in a 6 man this is 6v6 this game mode earns you a lot of money and rep but the downfall is it is very time consuming each game length is 5 mins long and there are 4 quarters in total.. NBA 2K is hit or miss. 2K17 is huge disappointment. Career was better than last year with Spike Lee but it was mediocre at best. EA is stepping up their game with Live 18, lets see what 2K has to offer.. The AI is horrible, running plays is almost impossible, but otherwise online play is quite fun. MyPark and Pro-Am are annoying at times because of either connection or glitches, but if you can get over a few things the game can be very entertaining.. I love the game and all of it's amazing features, my only complaint is the **** you do pretty much anything you'll get a foul... Other than that the game is a solid mix of real life basketball and a little bit of showmanship... :). It is an amazing and addictive game if you love the Nba. The bad thing I find in this game and in general to all the annual games is that there are not many changes in its sequels. The first graphics are incredible but they have almost nothing of difference with the previous delivery. The gameplay also does not have a difference with the previous delivery, improves the career mode and the GM. That if in comparison with other annual games this game is the best of all time (fifa, etc) In conclusion is an addictive game that can entertain you for dozens of hours. Although if you have a recent previous game as the nba 2k15 or 16 I do not recommend buying this video game as it does not offer something spectacular that sets you apart from previous releases.. This game is outstanding and is one of the best sports games ever made. The game includes about 15 different modes and each one is distinct and unique. The MyCareer mode let's you play a highly custimizable story letting you choose your contracts and even your schedule in the NBA. The online modes let you connect and play with your friends easily. The commentary, ai, player models, and stadiums all feel unique and interesting. They could improve on the repetitiveness and the online lag though. Overall this is a really good game that deserves an 8.5.. Though the story is lacking compared to Spike Lee's outing in the last game, NBA 2K17 delivers in many ways, including the visuals and the gameplay. Takes a while to get used to, with the new presentation style, but overall a solid game.. There isn't much to be said about this game, although I believe the game mode MyCareer, is a very welcome addition to Career mode in sports video games, unfortunately this is a sports game, and I personally have trouble staying interested in a sports game, so when your game mode can actually get me hooked because of the half-decent story told for your player. you did something right. I gave this game a 6 out of 10 because I think it's definitely above average, it was even a candidate for a 7, but it fell short, I just feel like I really love how many more features the game has than any of EA's sports titles, I'm looking at you Madden, so overall. not bad, not bad at all.. The server is a holocaust of game play. Just absolute garbage. Government computers work better! I don't know who the hell is working there, if anyone, but I have to update and clear cache EVERY SINGLE TIME! The game gets a 1 because you can rarely ever get a chance to play it with all the constant updates that take an eternity. Actually game play is bad at best too. Free throw shooting is extremely difficult and guys never miss as badly as the game makes it out to be. Too many errand passes and just way too much control button stuffing carpel tunnel action to do anything cool. Also, how Steph Curry is rated 93 and LBJ 97+ is ridiculous. LeBron isn't even a top 5 player anymore and Steph may very well be the greatest player ever. Too much LeBron love like Kobe had and neither player is at the top of the NBA. Playing someone living somewhere else you'll need a top of the line internet connection otherwise just throw the game in the garbage. You can't make subs before the game and the auto function always has to be engaged during game play. Sad! Also making subs without pushing pause is like solving calculus. F this game, it's awful.. This game is sooo broken! Terrible animations, horrible graphics, cpu 3 pointer spamming **** and so many goddamn turnovers. F*ck u Ronnie2k and LD2k!. Hello my name is Remar and I’ll be reviewing the top selling basketball game NBA 2k 17. First of this year they have added new gaming features like being able to choose different archetypes which give you different badges to earn. For example if you want to be a play maker you would be able to earn the hall of fame badges for example dimer you would be able to increases the percent of the pass leading to a score. Play makers would unlock all the play making badges like dimer ankle breaker and sharpshooters would unlock all the shooting badges etc. But if you want to have shooting badges when being a play maker you can still earn them, but just not be able to have the same scoring rate as the shooter visor versa. Following on this year they have brought the GRAND BADGE to the game. This badge can be earned by all archetypes but it increases the archetypes ability. For example if a slasher activates the badge they would have higher rate on all there hall of fame badges for around 2 minutes. Once finished you’d have to wait 2 and half minutes until it can be activated again. This badge can be activated by performing a high rate of game play. Also this year from 2k they have decided to keep the same parks but change some features on each park. Overall my review on 2k is 8/10 I enjoy playing against rivals in my park with my friends. I also like earning badges and going up rep in my park. I don’t really agree with the archetype scheme this year but overall I think it’s the best basketball game this year. The reason why I give it an 8/10 is because the servers are decent but could do with improvement. I highly recommend people to buy this game you can’t be disappointed it’s a great experience. Review By Remar Gordon. Not sure if it gets better or worse but those review guys will never know the real 2K. Anyways it's gotta be one of the worst games on my collection for the last couple years concerning basketball. Graphics are acceptable but as with all online dudes the thing gets worse and worse. For the 2K player from way back playback to newjack whatever your want to call it (2K17) I know what that headache is about fellas. Anyways buy it, dump it, recycle BS were accustomed to at this point.. NBA 2K17 is obviously the best game of the franchise. 2k work so hard and get so far ! because that game is amazing, When you play a match you feel like you're watching a real game on real life, it's perfect. Adding we have so many modes to play and have so much fun, Blacktop, Career mode, My Park, My Team, My league. If you love nba and play basketball, you've to play this game, you won't regret !. Finally sold my copy on ebay due to so many patches and bugs last years game was much better. I am so done with this game I tried. I am tired of playing Goldenstate warriors and CAVS. This game blows. Pros: Amazing Graphics Many game modes to choose from Multiplayer SIngleplayer Daily roster updates Customizable Character Gameplay is great Cons: 60gb of data required to play Server is not that great Download time is a long time NBA 2K17 is a great game. Although it may be pricey, it is definently worth it. There is many game modes including: MyCareer and MyPark. I will define these game modes for you. MyCareer is a game mode in which players can create their own player. Players create their own player then you play 4-5 college games and depending on those games that is what decides where you go in the NBA Draft. Players can upgrade their MyPlayer using Virtual Currency. MyPark is a game mode where online players use their MyPlayer to play online against other people. They can choose 3 parks: Sunset, Old Town,or Rivet City. (Beware: Players ankles might be broken if they are not a good overall.) This game is made by Visual Concepts and 2K Sports. I bought this game for $60 but it is worth it. My personal experience with this game is really great. I have not had many glitches happen to me, but when they did happen they were funny glitches. The only problem with this game was it took 2 days to download and the updates take 5-7 hours. MyPark has been a little glitchy for me but that may not be the case for you. I would rate this game a 4.5/5 stars because this game is really fun and has no major flaws. Hopefully this review helped you.. Nba2k17 review and more! Pros on the game. Graphics are amazing Story mode is spot on Bunch of game modes Shoes are wonderful Cons to the game. Servers are terrible A lot of glitches Update take forever to upload Nba 2K is 60 dollars in some cases is quite pricey, but is worth the wait! Your can buy it at most gaming stores or online. Nba is the perfect game to play if you are a basketball fan and just love basketball. You can play online in myPark and play against other people and make new friends. There are also other game modes too for example there is blacktop and myLeague or myGm or myCareer. MyCareer is the way you level up your player to go online. So if you want to have fun and play basketball Nba2k17 is for you. Nba focuses on one category for the game modes and that is myCareer. In my opinion they did a amazing job with myCareer, you get to experience what it like to be a true nba prospect, like going through college and getting scouted and even getting drafted! There are cutscenes that let your interact through the whole story mode. You even have a girlfriend and you have to choose whether to pick the nba or her. You can customize your character too, Like you can choose what he wears and your can even customize his personal look. Nba Has some cons though too. Some of the bad things is the servers to play online modes are super slow and very choppy. In Mypark You lag out of the parks and your end up playing the best people on your consoles . I wish there were levels and each level brought different people. Nba has a lot of glitches too, like when you're dribbling the ball might go through your defender and the same thing might happen on the other end to you too. Overall Nba2k17 is an awesome game. I recommend this game to all ages and hope that your have fun playing this game and hope this review helped you. (:. NBA 2k17 Tyler LeClair Period 4 Game Review Pros- Great Graphics Multiple games modes (Blacktop, Online, Play now, and My Team) My Career Story line Allows to play with friends and strangers Cons- Lags and glitches Released by Visual Concepts on Sep. 20th 2016, NBA 2k 17 was a hit. Sold for a reasonable price at $60, many people preordered the game and bought it the day it came out. This booming game is very addicting and hard to put down. It’s game modes allow you to play in the park, blacktop, your customized player's career, and vs the computer. The My Career and the Park are the most played game modes in the game. The park and My career are connected. My Career allows you to customize your player and make him better for the team you play for. While in My Career you go through college, international play, and the NBA. If you have PSN (Playstation Network) or Xbox Live the Park is another feature you can access. The Park allows you to use the player you have customized and upgraded to play against other online players. I give NBA 2k17 5 stars. This game is masterfully done and the graphics are like I’m watching a game on tv. The multiple game modes allow for endless fun. I spend most of my time in the Park or playing games in My Career. When I’m in the Park I like to play with my friends but sometimes the game lags out or glitches. I sometimes end up having to exit the entire PS4 and restart it. Other times I have the ball dribbling up the court and I glitch out of bounds. The My Career Storyline is incredible. It started out showing a highlight reel of me in highschool and then allows you to choose the college you want to go to. I chose Kansas and played the five games it allows you. I then went to a special game and got chosen in the NBA draft. I upgraded my player and began using him in the Park and in games. Overall this is a great game. It satisfies the needs of any age. The controls are easy to learn and easy to master. If you have any questions leave a comment and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pros- Play Today, MyPark, MyCareer, MyTeam, MyLeague, MyGM, Pro-Am, Postseason, Single and Multiplayer game modes Cons- Have to buy on online membership, Glitches, Some player builds are wrong, NBA 2K17 was made by Visual Concepts. You can play this on PS4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360, and PC. This game brand new can cost from 60-100 dollars. There are three editions regular, gold, and legendary and with each edition you can get certain “boosts” such as extra VC which you can use to boost your MyPlayer. You can also get clothes for your MyPlayer which you can use in MyPark. The most played mode is either MyCareer or MyPark. MyCareer takes gaming to a whole new level. You take your own player through the ranks from college to the Hall of Fame. You choose your build, position, and your players play style. From there you just play in college then in the NBA. Every game you can earn VC based on how you play and your salary for that game. You control your player and that is it, you take control of your own legacy. This meaning you work yourself up the ranks with your teammates and Justice Young. You two are the face of whichever franchise you get drafted to and take the league by storm. Justice Young is your teammate in which you can take control of when u active Orange Juice, which you earn by getting assists from him or earning assists from him. The overall idea of MyCareer is amazing, the fact that you and only you can control your destiny is great. It is not exactly like real life but consists of some of the same things. My favorite part about this game is the way in which you can customize your player's moves. Which means their jump shot, dribble moves, dunks, layups and clothes. You can make your player look like you, copy a former NBA star or just be creative with your player. I like how you can choose your own jump shot because it does not make your player one dimensional. What I mean by that is, you can change how your player plays in regards to their shot form and the way they play. This makes you get more comfortable with your players form and the way you should play depending on if you are a playmaker or a lockdown defender, because if you are a lockdown defender you won’t be hitting three’s every single time down the court as a sharpshooter would. Overall I personally think MyCareer is the best game mode in the game because it takes you through what it is like to be an NBA player. MyPark is another amazing feature on 2K17. You take your upgraded custom MyPlayer to an online Park and play against other players that are online. You can partake in a game of 21, 2v2, 3v3, and 5v5. Every time you play you can earn VC depending on how you play in that game. You also play with friends which can help you earn more VC because then you can have a certain game plan that game which would help you earn more VC. There are also many animations in the game which you can enjoy. Such as pre-game rituals, winning celebrations and more. NBA 2K17 also has amazing graphics and updates. They really stepped up their game this year with all of this. Tattos, gear and more are more realistic. For example Shooting Guard, J.J. **** of the Los Angeles Clippers, went and got a tattoo on his arm this past off season and 2K17 did a great job of adding this detail into the game. The one real big complaint I do have is all the glitches and lags in MyPark, which I hope they would fix. But other than that I can’t complain. Visual Concepts did an amazing job this year and really improved the game. I hope next year they do the same too.. Pro’s My career mode My team My park Graphics Cons Online loading is long I got NBA 2k17 for my Ps4 and the graphics for the game were phenomenal 2k made the game feel like you are in the real game also you can have various types of modes it still has the career mode like normal but you also can have more than one type of My career players you can have about 5 or 6 players. And you can have your own fantasy draft of players on My Team. You can still play on my park and also you can play with your friends and play normal NBA teams against them. You are able to make your My Player better at various things you can make a player that is known for making 3 pointers or a player that is amazing at dunking. Also “My Park” is a lot better in 2k17 than it is in the previous years. But it is a lot harder to get more “Rep” from the previous years. A new thing in “My career” is that you can now get sponsors and you can get extra VC for going to events. There are additional events you also can have if you get the “Legend mode” the legend mode for the game comes with a free 30,000 Vc and it is amazing to get your My player started or get a jumpstart on your upgrades for your My Player. I would think this game rating is appropriate for everyone unless you are going to be playing in My Park if you are going to be playing in My Park you probably and to be 14 or older. But this game is great for everyone and it is age appropriate for anyone and everyone. But there are a few things I thought 2K could do better like it takes a long time to load My Park and also if you just want to play a game against someone you better have some patients because it might take about 5 minutes to load the game and there are a few glitches in the game but overall it isn’t so bad. If you thought that 2k16 was the best game 2K was going to make you are WAY wrong this is by far the best game 2K has made and I can’t wait till NBA 2k18 comes out.. At some point the 2K Sports team stopped listening to the fans of the game. Whether it's because they think it's to a point where they are just going to buy the game every year, because of what it is. Gameplay has now been cut and pasted three years strait. They still have not brought back the full online association. Servers are still horrendous (see 2K After Dark). Fans have been voicing major issues and 2K has not listened just continue on there way. One thing that really bugs me individually and have tweeted 2K regarding issues such as online league games do not earn you VCs! This renders this mode useless. 2K has become EA Sports after getting to the top. NBA 2K no longer looks for innovation.. This game makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I feel like the people who made this game spent way too much time on the graphics and the story mode of MyCareer rather than working out the various glitches and the mishaps that the game has. When you play online, their is this glitch where if you are sprinting full speed and accidentally bump into the opposing player, they call an offensive foul on you, meanwhile you were trying to avoid contact with the opposing player. This game has been out for months, and they have yet to fix that glitch. With MyCareer, the wait times, the loading wait times, the cut scenes, and the filler are so annoying especially when you just want to play the damn game. And the worst part is, they do not allow you to skip them! Unreal! How can you release a video game without allowing the users to skip the cut scenes when they just want to play instead of having to wait through irrelevant things! Another thing is the cut scenes are not even important to the game itself or the MyCareer mode! So why can't I skip it and just move on so I can play my game? And one more last thing: MyTeam. When you play single player mode on MyTeam, and you play domination whether it is historic or regular domination, it is so hard to beat the team you are playing against (or trying to dominate) when they make the cheapest and toughest shots ever! You can be playing the most toughest defense ever on a player in domination and they would still make the shot! And it gets worse if you have bronze or silver players, because it so much more difficult to beat teams with those cards. But it still happens when you have emerald, sapphire, ruby or even amethyst players going up against simply silver and gold players when the players that you have that have a higher type card level should be able to simply dominate the silver and gold players when you would have sapphire or ruby players! I honestly believe they placed way too much focus on the graphics of this game rather than fixing the glitches, allowing us to skip through the cut scenes and made MyTeam so irritating when it does not even have to be.. this is easily the best sports game i have ever played. the gameplay is smooth. the graphics are top notch. the modes are sweet. everything actually feels like a real nba game. i love season mode now that you can upload team designs. my only complaint is that charging foul **** you literally get that foul called on you all of time and it slows down the pace. other than that this is a perfect game a huge step up from the snooze fest of 2k16. They need to get rid of college games. For some reason the AI in it is like the special squad. They pass when there's a defender in front of them, they take shots even Curry wouldn't make. Either that or make it so when the bar fills up, it actually increases the chance of you making the shot. My character can't make a shot when it's nearly filled, but he'll make it when it's not as filled. So they basically lie when they say "" fill it up to increase your chances of making a shot "" is just BS.. I made a account just to review this god awful joke ****. Once again 2K proves that they have never seen a basketball game in their life. Unrealistic animations, awful physics, horrible fouls and missing wide open dunks and layups 50% of the time is only some of the issues that plague this awful game. Last NBA2K game i ever buy. What a freakin joke.. 2k's basketball franchise continues to deliver with scary and realistic visuals along with accurate tendencies and in-game rituals of real life players. The shot release for Stephen Curry is so realistic and perfect with his real life one, my father thought I was watching an actual basketball game. That says it all.. My first NBA after years. I dont play 2k16. NBA 2k 17 is great game. I start carrer mode with player with my face. I started MyTEAM, when i get new cards. Time wasting game. Quite well, nice mods, nice all. A little hard weekly last challenge :D. The gameplay as always is great, but overall the game is boring and frustrating. In My Career mode I spend way more time in practice, and watching loading screens before and after each practice (sometimes there are 4 practises in a single off day), than actually playing the game. Then there is the attribute hard cap. I have a 6""7 shooting guard (also gets played at small forward) that is capper at 11 out of 30 for layups and dunks. So if you are hoping to build a played in the mould of Lebron, Kobe or Curry (I won't even mention MJ)... forget it. Overall the game has gone backwards.. Love it the magma is fantastic the only thing is when you play a game your center is always at the top the of the key, forcing you to fix that. Not too many game play flaws except for some animations that force your player yo pick up the ball just to get it stripped among immediate contact from the defender.. The big problem with this game is AI. Teammate are very stupid. They leave large spaces in defense, even great defenders when they are on our team has an income far below. The defense of the CPU is excelent, no matter the team, no matter the players. even those with low overall are great like Leonard. This always happened since the anterios versions and is only getting worse.. I love playing nba2k sports series but this one is dissaponting lots of flaws coaches looks all the same, the gameplay is bad post moves ****! player can go through another like a ghost repetitive actions during free throws and time outs most of the players are skinny, i snot playable for me nba2k16 is better i played that only online im excited to buy this but when i played it it verry dissapointing! i hope they improve it next year.... Most of this game is unplayable if you do not sign in to PSN. Excessive unskippable cutscenes and poor story in MyCareer mode. Game play is fine and similar to previous iterations.. Do not buy this game. They decided to spend more money on 2k tv then they did on simple quality assurance. Play 10 minutes of a myplayer game and you will realize the people that made and designed the game have never watched a basketball game except for on tv. Easy things to point out that are major flaws to me: 1. your PG will turnover the ball at least 4 times a game on fast break. (I have had my 89 ovr justice young turnover the ball 8 times before halftime on the fast break) 2. behind the back crossover should just be taken out of the game, this has been an ongoing issue for this game for multiple iterations with no fix in sight. if you do a behind the back cross and someone is guarding you its an auto-turnover. I tend to hit that crossover on accident a lot which forced me to stop playing PG altogether on myplayer. 3. lock stick should have never been taken out of the game, people just run around you so often its a joke. 4. I'm not sure how anyone can say movement is fluid because its the exact opposite. plays run for you with 2 back screens to free you up for a 3 rarely ever work because I can never get the guys to run into the screens properly, or if they do they are back on me by the time I'm taking a 3. Pretty much the only times to take 3s are coming off a screen you call for yourself or on the fastbreak 5. The worst and almost pointless card game out of all the sports games I played this year (mlb,nba,madden). I'm really disappointed with 2k17, especially with MyCareer mode. I turned up the difficulty way higher looking for a real challenge. Unfortunately all it has resulted in is weird, unexplainable behaviour from my teammates - like ton of unforced turnovers and stepping out of bounds. Also my player can be randomly pushed back by opposing players. Opponents set screens so illegal you might as well sell drugs with it, they make impossible shots with perfect defense and block your shots without even touching the ball (sic!). Sometimes players you guard on the perimeter almost teleport like two feets closer to the basket and move by ",2K17 was and still is the GREATEST NBA 2K game of all time . the graphics are still incredible and the soundtrack is still incredible . i'm not that impressed with the graphics though .
568.Battlefield: Bad Company 2,"Bad Company 2 is the real deal. It brings a funny campaign and a incredible multiplayer experience. In general, it's better than Bad company 1. Better campagn, better graphics, better gunplay, etc. The only thing a little bit worse is the destruction of scenario, still a very good game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is a review of the single player because the multiplayer is amazing. I know it I have played it way too much as a kid but now I'm playing the single player because it's a kind of the only thing that's still alive. So you remember that like Cast of characters for the first game that has agency going out to do their own thing finding goals lay making plans just all around just a kind of funny goofball group. They are back with no agency this time. They feel like they're mostly here because hey they're likeable and we have to put them in the sequel even if the stories were done in the first game and now it fills like most of their charismat has been **** out of their face I saw that they had a new writte for this game. So maybe he didn't know how to write them correct. But the gameplay is better than the original and what I mean. Is that it feels like the most okay shooter for this time when you shoot the enemies and that is about it. No more big Maps you can go about and finish the objective for many angles now you play like a generic Call of Duty game and not one of the good ones. Locally the multiplayer is amazing and fun, but sadly I have inviting this review at a time. Where it no longer exists on the console, so that's just about it. Hope you have good memories about it because now we're just lived with a bad single player.. This game is fantastic. It holds up very well and still, to this day, is a Top 3 online FPS of all time.. We had it all, this game was just perfect in every way from the multiplayer to the campaign and man that soundtrack do be hitting different. The game does have great details for its time but it does not hold up to modern times, in my opinion. It's not a game I want to go back to. It also has slow load times. To me, it was average at best.. Visually stunning, superb gameplay. Instant bar setter for war-themed FPS games.. Atmosphere: 8 Enjoyment: 8 Gameplay: 8 Graphics: 8 Music: 6 Story: 8 Total: 7.67. One of the best Games of the Series and a true cornerstone to the Battlefield Franchise! Buy!. An incredible FPS .Story wise the Characters are funny and likeable and the missions are fun, gameplay i think could've been polished in the UI i think is too big the FOV or weapons are giant ,but even without polishing one of the best battlefield games.. The campaign story is quite different from the first one. The heroism makes the characters more like GOOD COMPANY than BAD COMPANY.. Xbox ONE S compatibility mode, single-player only. BC2 has been an interesting game due to the shift it brought to its series. I played it before, when it came out, on PC, but I did not finish it back then (I don't think I actually did more than 2 missions) because it never really pulled me in. Technically, it is a better game than the first game in the sub-series. It has tighter controls, the movement is not as slow - does not feel like wading through waist deep mud - the weapons are much more accurate and actually hit where you aim instead of some stupid low effort RNG, the dialogue between the characters is not a bunch of cringe, etc. Yet, in the end, it still fails to interest and has some underlying issues both as a standalone game, and as a part of the Battlefield series of games. First, let's finish talking about technical stuff. Starting off with graphics, they are, for its time, top notch. Perhaps not the best, but they are definitely up there. The game also no longer relies on the destruction effects and constant barrage of explosions to carry its otherwise mediocre presentation, the game actually looks good on its own. A lot of this also has to do with the fact that you will visit multitude of different locations around the world which have been pretty well recreated. This brings us to level design, which is nothing like the previous Battlefield games and is one of the first large signs of what I like to refer to as ""CoDification"" of games / game series (does not necessarily apply to shooters only). Aside from one specific late-game mission, it is very linear and I can't remember one single instance outside of that specific mission where vehicle sections were not forced or completely scripted. As was noted previously, the look good in terms of graphics, but some sections of them feel a bit unnatural with strange and openly forced choke-points and places which do look accessible on first look, but you'll find yourself cut off by invisible walls or debris / junk with way too large hitboxes that can't be jumped over. Sound, on the other hand, is spectacular - the sound engineering is awesome, weapons sound great and the echoes and changes depending on your location are even better than in first Bad Company, and there are even more minor sound details for movement and shooting now, with ejected shells clinking around differently on specific surfaces, etc. The music on the other hand, is pretty uninspired. It is technically well produced, and the direction is pretty spot on, but it has been CoDified - quasi-orchestral ""bombastic"" pieces, etc. Given the sound quality is so good overall, it's a real shame they did not go their own way on this one. Technical stuff (mostly) over, let's talk about mechanics briefly - the CoDification is also very apparent here. Very short TTK and TTD, although fitting for a linear corridor bro shooter, is a bit jarring if you played and liked some of the previous Battlefield games. It's, as was mentioned, tight, guns shoot well, etc., but this is no longer Battlefield. Evolution of mechanics is one thing, but just like in the level design, this is just a CoD copy at this point. It plays well enough, but CoD did this earlier and did it even better than this game. Now, I mentioned the dialogue between characters is much better, it's evolved from ""what CEO thinks 12-14 years old think is funny banter"" into an actual banter between adults, for the most part - there are still some ""Target Audience: Under 15"" moments, but not that many - though there is at least one during a pretty important story moment that just ruins it further, not that it was really any good to begin with, but it just drives the last nail into the coffin. The story is CoDified to hell and back - from a bunch of misfits, who go AWOL, invade a foreign country to steal a couple tons of gold from a PMC, kidnap a dictator and steal his gold-plated attack helicopter, then somehow manage to get back into their army and then actually steal some of the gold from said army, we get a generic ""villain gets a superweapon with which they want to destory / conquer / both the world"". The story is forgettable, it has nothing to do with the previous story, the cliffhanger at the end of BC1 means nothing, and there is no gold, only a pile of crap story that you will forget as soon as you finish the game. Last thing I want to mention is technical, but an important aspect of the Bad Company mini-series - the destruction is disappointing. It's not better than BC1, but there are less explosive barrels around, so it feels a bit more natural. Unfortunately, most of the destructive models (and vehicles and some other stuff too) are taken from BC1 with minor graphical improvements - perhaps a price for the bi-annual release. Conclusion: Generic CoD-a-like with minor discerning features, a disappointment in many ways. Technically well produced, but forgettable and generic.. Bf BC2 surprises with its sensational mutiplayer for the time, but it sins a lot in its history, but it pays when it is analyzed that the Bf saga until then focused on the online and what it could provide in this environment. Despite the repetitive classes and objectives in the matches, the game showed potential with weapons and with vast maps that generated hours and hours of fun and competitiveness. A great FPS until today!.

I love this game it is am absolute masterpiece and they really need to make a new one soon. Fantastic, I can overlook the dated cold-war-gone-hot trope because this game is a military comedy. Multiplayer basically is the entirety of the high rating.. BATTLEFIELD: BAD COMPANY 2 - best battlefield game ever made! Very good story and great action! Thanks for developers!. The game that convinced me that the Battlefield franchise destroys the Call of Duty franchise. I spent countless hours playing multiplayer. I ALWAYS go back ever so often to relive the experience.. This game was Battlefield at it's finest. The game runs well on the Xbox 360 at 1080p and still looks good to this day. Possibly one of the best FPS games of all time. The biggest problem this game has would probably be the lack of players as of 2019. Generally, if you want more than 1v1 you'll have to wait to play on the weekends.. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 has the best multiplayer out of any Battlefield game that I've ever played (I haven't played 4).. Battlefield Bad Company 2 - one of the best parts of a series. Perhaps, it is the last Battlefield what it had to be, but not reskiny a gameplay of Call of Duty (BF5 became an exception). Here the best singleplayer, the best plot, excellent balance, memorable cards. It is a pity that Bad Company did not optimize under Xbox One X, otherwise the sense in BF5 was not at all. The best Battlefield in a series, after BF3.. Battlefield: bad company 2 is a work of art perfect. Simply amazing ... great story of falling your chin! Graphics good to time and in addition know very well as being a FPS. 9 for me!. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is an excellent game. A true evolution from Bad Company. The first good move DICE did was put more emphasis on gun-play rather than vehicular combat. One thing that DICE screwed up was, of course the campaign. While this campaign is fun for the shooty-shooty gun-gun parts, the storyline is a total snore-fest! DICE really needs to get some talented writers and directors together to create a good campaign, because the CoD and Halo franchises had great campaigns, so why can't Battlefield? Anyhow, you will completely forget about the campaign once you get started playing the fantastic multiplayer, because it is great. By incorporating true cooperation between players to win matches, rather than being a violent bloodbath like in CoD. The Frostbite engine is great. While the visuals are pretty forgettable, the destructible environments are a very welcome addition that adds to the suspense and tension of matches. Not to mention the incredible sound design! Man, the sound design in this game feels very triple-A, and a lot of effort was put into it, which is good. Overall, Bad Company 2 is a great game, which is worth every cent of the purchase price, solely because of how great the multiplayer is, especially when you play the objectively best game mode: Rush.. A really, really fun FPS that is still alive today: Pros: -Very engaging campaign with good characters -Good gunplay -decent graphics for the Xbox 360 -incredible sound design -Outstanding multiplayer that can have intense moments during games, as well as good maps and game modes (with my personal favourite being Rush) -Cool class system -Good destruction -Awesome vehicle usage Cons: -While good, the campaign is quite short -Can sometimes take a while to find matches (which is expected due to the game's age) -Can sometimes put you on unbalanced teams, with your team having more than the enemy team and vice versa In the end: Story: 8/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Multiplayer: 9/10 Graphics/Sound design: 8/10 Overall: 8.5/10. NOTE:This is a single-player only review. Battlefield Bad Company 2 is a decent game,but is a step back from it's predecessor. The campaign is generic as hell,and despite some amazing levels,particularly the snow level early in the game,the campaign felt unfinished,with some downright stupid AI at times.I know this is a primarily multiplayer game,but at least give a good campaign for the single-player gamers like myself. The graphics are great,with a solid framerate too. The sound design is amazing,but the soundtrack ****. Overall,Battlefield Bad Company 2 is an okay game,but if you are a single-player gamer like me,don't bother with this one.. Best battlefield game to date. The personality in this game is unmatched. The maps were very well designed and the sniping was challenging and very rewarding. Fun to play with a squad.. This battlefield actually has a good campaign! I enjoyed like hell and love playing muiltplayer with my friends, its just way to much fun. Story may not be something like last of us buts its actually funny and cool. Despite this game being 5 years old, it is still worthy of playing in the battlefield series. Multiplayer servers are still going strong and out of BF3 and 4, the MP action in BF2BC seems better and gives you more opportunity to survive a bit longer, whether you are a noob or a rank 50. With great vast maps like Heavy Metal and a recon's dream in Harvest Day you will have a lot of fun. (conquest and rush plus more all add great variations to how you can play) The single player game has some great some moments and the destruction physics are pretty good. Having played BC1 and 2, there is something about the characters that you enjoy, they are funny and quite frankly stupidly likeable. Single player in BF3 and 4 were embarrassing, dialogue ridiculously scripted. BF2BC is worth buying if you haven't played it, I have it on PC and 360 and always find myself returning to it after getting bored with the current MP offerings out there currently. Worth a £10 and you will have hours, days, weeks, months of fun ranking up your weapons and gadgets, helis, tanks etc. A great game.. I got this game a while after it came out (A month or so), and I gotta say, I was pleased with it. Not only did the explosions and impacts delight me but so did the great guns. Another cool thing about this game that I thought was that everybody on the online community was very polite and we kind of worked together to win. Nowadays I gotta say, the online gaming community is a **** now. People don't care about playing the objective or the actual games most people sit around, troll, or do some other annoying crap. The biggest downer about this game was that its campaign was horrible. Now I understand some people may like it and I respect that but I just thought that the whole story was pretty ridiculous. Overall I think this is one of the best battlefield games in the series, but there are still a lot more (Hopefully) to come.. A good fun game, decent campaign and very entertaining multiplayer. I am pretty new to FPS multiplayer but I just can't honestly say that this game is better than modern warfare 2, it just plain isn't and with two games offering such similar experiences I think you would be in good stead playing through the campaign but leaving the multiplayer to modern warfare 2 (that is my opinion based on release dates) On writing this review ghosts and battlefield 4 have just come out, still I would recommend for multiplayer either battlefield 3 for high scale broad multi or modern warfare for shorter more arcade style fast paced action.. ---Rating--- Design: 4 /5 (interesting and unique gunplay, and an unusually enjoyable SP campaign) Polish: 4 /5 (very good graphics and mostly bug-free, but suspect hit detection at times) Value: 4 /5 (standard price, maps are quite large but there could always be more of them) ---Review--- A solid online multiplayer FPS with a moderately enjoyable singleplayer campaign to boot. The game features a good variety of weapons and gadgets that- for the most part- legitimately feel different from one another, but the process of unlocking weapons seems quite superfluous and even masochistic given the game's base learning curve. The maps combine a comparatively impressive sense of scale with the dynamic experience of a destructible environment, along with accommodating higher player counts than its direct competitors. As with just about every other FPS, the hit detection can be a bit suspect at times and there are a few balance issues, but altogether BC2 strikes an enjoyable balance between action and tactics.. this game is super fun and i recommend it. although it does have some issues, overall it's great. the single player was short and not very fun. but the multiplayer was great, particularly for its destruction.. the game made me ditch COD. Overall amazing MP experience. excellent Map Design, IMO, better than BF3. Like rush, what an addictic mode. BFBC2 and BF3 have a mature community than COD, (e.g, trash talk, cheaters) still happened in the game, but much much better than other online games. also, a game needs true corporation and teamwork, have a few friends, play with your clan, the game is a blessing.. this review coming from a heavily seasoned battlefield players view, i love bad company 2! i have indeed played all of the battlefield games thankfully, and this one is my 3rd favrite! For battlefield veterans, you will defenitally love bad comapny 2!. The multiplayer is the shining star for this game. Destructive environments, well-balanced classes and vehicle combat. The single player story is good enough for a 1 time play through but is not engaging as some of the other stories in the FPS marketplace.. Im not a fan boy but I love this game. This is the only shooter I really like, Dont care for COD, Halo or the other BC titles. This game is great. the online player base is pretty low these days but it dont stop me from enjoying the best shooter to date. IMO. Battlefield Bad Company 2 proved to be really fun for me in the campaign and multiplayer in the campaign it had great story with rememberal characters with a good sense of humor that made the campaign more playable and the multiplayer with the new update in the frostbite engine not just made it fun but destructive and intense so in at least in my opinion one of the best FPS of all time.. Battlefield Bad Company 2 without a doubt is one of the best console fps games I have ever played. I picked it up again recently after more than a year of playing other fps games and it is still great. Single player campaign is fun even when replaying and feels head and shoulders above bland and boring attempts at storytelling both of Battlefield 3 and Modern Warfare 3 to name a few recent failures. It has memorable characters which are not too serious about themselves, Battlefield signature destructible environments, plot with some rather predictable twists, is blissfully free of nuclear terrorists and it manages to conclude itself before getting too long and boring. Battlefield Bad Company 2 multiplayer has something that I have yet to find in any other fps. I liked the game, at first I was skeptical, and a bit of a ""Call of duty fanboy"" but I soon got into the game, I didn't like the singleplayer very much, but it wasn't terrible. The multiplayer was quite fun, and still is today.. The campaign is the only thing in this game that disappoints, but when you get to the multiplayer you will not be able to stop playing. Bad Company 2 is the best online FPS experience out there. You are basically thrown in a battle with complete freedom on what to do. Tanks, helicopters... you name it, only jets got taken out. The maps are huge especially if you are playing rush mode. Weapons aren't less player friendly, but more realistic. The sound effects are the best out there. The main game persists in teamwork, but if you want to do things on your own there is also a mode for that. Finally the best part of all... environmental destruction, all buildings, all walls, all trees even the ground isn't safe. But the bad things about Bad Company 2 are few improvements from the first Bad Company. Destruction improvements are less than promised and only the graphics are more improved. Tampering with the rush mode has made it more uninteresting than in the previous installment. In the campaign you are given less freedom than previously and your squad mates become completely useless. And worst of all Haggard doesn't act like Haggard at all. If you play Modern Warfare please play other battlefields before Bad Company. It may come useful.. Battlefield Bad Company 2 has something that Battlefield 3 didn't have, a great single player. Its a bit short but a hell of a lot of fun. And the multiplayer is as amazing as battlefield 3's. So if you are of getting Battlefield Bad Company 2 or Battlefield 3, Battlefield Bad Company is the game for you. Single player 8/10 Multiplayer 10/10 Battlefield Bad Company 2 9.1/10. best game ever. no competition. I use to be a cod fan boy till i took an arrow to the knee. but seriously i hated this game at first, because i was used to the fantasy physics and shooting in other shooters. I eventually adjusted and fell in love with this game. Also it has the best graphics for any game on console. If you play cod after this game, you will think you are in a cartoon. ALso this game requires the most tactics to be successful and survive and thrive. Im guessing NF123 never wins, do to her lack of understanding of way gameinformer says this is the most tactical game, because if you wanna win it is. you have to ensure your team doesn't have only mechanics or medics, you gotta have the right mix of mechanics, support, medics, and a few snipers. Just like in real life. imagine if armies were only snipers. whole wars could be fought in new york city, and it would just appear that the crime right has slightly gone up.. A very fun multiplayer. One of the best among fps's. They fixed most of the problems in bad company 1, but the campaign is a bit boring and uninteresting. Its ""cinematic events"" are just not as exciting or interesting as ones in its major competitor, cod, but its multiplayer makes up for a poor campaign. This game has nice Visuals and plays well but the single player was not worth it but battlefield is about the multi player. This game is not easy because you have to play as a team. Cod Tactics will not work because the maps are huge and destroyable. Destruction 2.0 changes the game because cover is gone then it will get harder as the match progresses. I would say this is a great game and a must have for battlefield fans (or bad company fans).. Battlefield Bad Company 2 is, in my opinion, one of the greatest online FPS of all time! Obviously it has fault at some points (campaign isn't great) but the online aspect of the game is outstanding. The maps are huge, they provide different sorts of enviroments and best of all, something that most online games struggle at, they are BALANCED. DICE really have discovered hidden treasure because the quality of gameplay, graphics and teamwork. I find myself playing the game 3-5 hours daily and not once do I ever ""rage quit"" or get bored. The Cod series really need to step up to the plate this time and come up with new ideas as revamping older games into new games and selling them off for 50+ just simply isn't good enough. I challenge anyone to play Battlefield Bad Comany 2 online for 2-3 hours for a few days in 1 week and prove me wrong. All in all, 10/10 is my verdict. Simply a masterpiece, thinking ""outside the box"" is a huge step forward for gaming innovation.. had high hopes for this game, i loved the first bad company. The first game had it's flaws sure but it where a different experience from other games in the same genre. This review is going to be a both a comparison towards the first game and other games in the same genre. SINGLEPLAYER The singleplayer part of the game is the disappointing part of the game for sure. The first bad company game had a special feeling when you sat down to play. Even though it was a hidden linear experience,BC2 is a more linear experience then the first game and more to compare towards infinity wards Modern Warfare 2. The environments are still as large and open world as the first game but there is more directions of exact ways to play through the game. I prefer the way from the first game since it makes it worth playing again. Even though i explained the linear part of the game the singleplayer has more flaws. The story is for me the biggest NoNo with this game. The story is boring and now 1 week after i finished the game i still can't remember why i did all the things i did during the singleplayer campaign. The first game had a good script and humor, while this just has a boring story that in the end makes you skip the cutscenes. MULTIPLAYER DICE is a company famous for great multiplayer in their games and as you may have guessed this is one of the best multiplayer releases this year. It got the usual ranking system from the first game and now it got more reasons to rank up. The tactical destruction is a main part of the multiplayer that you're going to miss when it's gone. I can't play games like Modern Warfare 2 since i played my first game of Bad Company 2. The destruction is giving the game a whole new tactical view over the battlefield. If an enemy is hiding in a building just blow a hole in the wall and dispose of him in a safe way. The unfortunate part of the multiplayer is the fact that sometimes you can get onto servers with 3-4 people playing even though there is a lot of soldiers out on the battlefield. Okay now i'm going to write a small thing about graphics. This game is using the inhouse developed frostbite engine and gives the game an awesome graphical standpoint. But there is a few flaws with the frostbite engine form my view. First one is that if your'e playing on a standard def tv the game is pretty dark on the original settings. I've tried out my xbox with 4 different SD Tv's and i need to sit for 3-5 minutes trying out different settings to get it okay. The second flaw is that why is there so much fog on every map? If your trying to use a sniper on some multiplayer maps you can't se further then 20 feet and on some you can see the end of the map on the other side. Great war game. The multiplayer offers endless opportunities with 4 different classes, loads of maps and 4 gametypes. You will get addicted. The campaign is weak though.. this is not awsome, but BF3 is better than Modern lolfare. also, nice gunplay ... in addition, BF: BC2 was so better. battlefiled: bad company 2 is one of the best games I have ever played mainly because of the game modes and maps, in the modern shooter genre.. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 is a sequel to Battlefield:Bad Company, and while it retains the same characters as the first Bad Company, there's really no mention of the events of the first game. The game definitely takes a much more serious tone, but still retains some of the comedy you'd seen in the first game, it's just a lot less goofy, and there aren't any golf carts anymore. The campaign's much better than what you'd seen in the first game. It starts off pretty slow, but gets much better toward the end, but that being said, the campaign is still quite mediocre. Assuming you bought the game new, you'll also get a bunch of free maps right away, and if you get the Ultimate Edition, the Onslaught (Objective-based survival-y mode) and Battlefield 1943 (Arcade title) for free. While I didn't find Onslaught all that fun, the 1943 is pretty nice and even being an arcade title, uses the Frostbite engine, meaning destruction and great graphics (for a $10 game). The main attraction of course, being multi-player, is great. You're still limited to the 24 players, but that's still much better than 12. There are some key differences from Bad Company's multiplayer to Bad Company 2. There's no longer the five kits: Assault, Recon, Specialist, Demolition and Support. Bad Company 2 features Assault, Engineer, Medic and Recon. Assault is very similar to Bad Company's variation, still being equipped with assault rifles and grenade launchers, and can now lay down ammo for teammates to resupply. Engineers are the combination of Demolition and Specialists, being equipped with SMG's and Carbines, rocket launchers and repair tools. Medic is fairly similar to the Support class, being equipped with LMG's, but now specialize in reviving and healing teammates. Then there's Recon, who are mixes of Recon and Specialist, having scoped rifles, and sabotage equipment (mortar strikes, C4 and motion sensors). And shotguns are now integrated as weapons to be used on any kit, alongside the G3 and M14. This new system works well, simplifying the so everyone knows their role. Assaults focus on just killing people, engineers work with the vehicles, medics keep up spawn tickets by reviving and lay down heavy fire with LMG's, and Recon take down enemies at long ranges and sabotage the enemy with their explosive equipment. In terms of vehicles, there isn't much change, but there are now vehicle specs, which allow you to carry a unique ability or piece of equipment for your vehicle, such as a coaxial LMG, increased health or damage, deployable smoke or mobile motion sensor. Then there's the human specs, which give things like increased damage or health, and increased weapon accuracy. And then weapon specs which include sights/scopes, extra ammo, faster movement and special shotgun slugs. There's also plenty of weapons to choose from, about 5-7 per kit, plus pistols (There are no longer silenced pistols), which oddly, in Bad Company 1, not all kits were equipped with. And one big thing Bad Company didn't have (at least at launch) Conquest, the most popular Battlefield game mode wasn't even featured in Bad comapny 1 until after launch, not to mention the gamen ever even came to PC players. Gold Rush is now just Rush, with crates you must arm, destroy with heavy explosives or crush. And yes, you can now collapse almost every building on the map, rather than just blowing the walls in. There is also a smaller variant of Rush called Squad Rush with scales down the game to cope with only 8 players, and no vehicles, and then Squad Deathmatch which has 16 players fighting for kills in 4 squads, with a single vehicle thrown into the mix. One last thing, the controls don't **** anymore. They're actually practical. So is this game worth it, yes. Any shooter fan should give it a try. A lot of players turn a blind eye to the Battlefield series due to its intense learning curve, but if you give it a chance and continue playing it, I promise you you'll get better, and start to like it more. So, improved destruction, more weapons, player options and better controls, not to mention the campaign going a step up from terrible, to just about playable (and hey, who really buys Battlefield for the campaign, seriously?), this game is a huge improvement over Battlefield: Bad Company. You can probably find this game for $20 now, a",bad company 2 is the real deal. it brings a funny campaign and an incredible multiplayer experience . the game does have great details for its time but it does not hold up to modern times . it's not a game i want to go back to .
569.The World Ends with You,"Best ost, Best gameplay, Best story Best DS Game And one of the best jrpgs ever made. If I could choose only one game that I considered absolutely essential specifically to the Nintendo DS system, it would be TWEWY. With an amazing cast of characters, a compelling story and character development, gorgeous art style, plenty of playlist worthy bangers, and some of the most satisfying character progression of any game I've ever played, I happily sank over 200 hours into this 25 hour game. It's a tragedy that a good port hasn't come along yet, but I don't know if anything is capable of capturing how great the touchscreen controls felt in the original.. The World Ends with You is a spectacular ****'s amazingin prettymuch every aspect. I enjoyed it a lot while playing it. This is a game that's alwayslike to go back to even after 10 years. Story of the gameis one of the most important aspects of the entire game. This is a game thatis good because it's amazingly filled with a good story. The story is about a teenager named Neku, who got trapped inside the ""Reapers game"" and literally fights for his life amongst with his companions that are also victims of the ""Reapers game"". As the story progresses, characters will talk about some very interesting phenomenons about life and would make you think about some very interesting questions. The story would constantly progress and not let go of your interest, and it delivers quite a few of very good messages. Gameplay-vise, this is one of the most unique and interesting games that were developed for the **** main thing that you do in The World Ends with You, is fight the ""Noise"". You do it by controlling Neku on the bottom screen using touch, and controlling Neku's partnerson the top screen using the buttons. This is a unique experience that a lot of developers don't imprint. To fight as Neku, we are provided with ""pins"" that have their own unique pcych. You obtain them by fighting against the noise, or purchasing them in the shop. Considering the fact that there are countless amount of pins you can acquire and play with, each player wouldbe able to find a pcych they would wantto play with. Meanwhile,on the top screen, you fight as another character. By inputting different button combinations and syncing up with Neku's partner, you wouldbe able to use a supermove that damages all enemies in your range. One other gameplay mechanic in The World ends with you is the necessity and ability walk around the streets of Shibuya of 2007. Those streets are filled with NPC's and cultural paintings and architectures that was aroundin 2007. The map is not too large, however,it'sso memorable and cosy to be in. So much that it's the only way you want it to look like. Lastly, I want to talk about the music. It's a **** songs in the game are very catchy and make me want to listen to them over and over again. I've had a great time with the game. I would recommend everyone to play it-- it's worth it. The story telling, characters, and music are what is saving this game back from a lower grade. But one of the worst combat systems in a JRPG, let alone a video game, undo anything promising that the game might have had. Battles are an absolute chore in this game.. The world ends with you is a masterpiece of storytelling. The combat is a bit difficult to get used to, but very satisfying to learn and get used to. It has a short playtime, but every second of story feels meaningful, and the only filler time is the game play.. very unique ds game from story and gameplays that mixes element such as music, fashion, trends etc.. One of the most stylish games I've ever played, it really encapsulate what the first years of the 21th century felt like. The art style and the way Tokyo is portayed and explorable is pure art, the soundtrack goes harder than your dad's belt, the gameplay is one of the more fun I've ever seen on the DS. To complete the game at 100% you really have to go all out, something even I couldn't do, but since the main campaign isn't really long at least you'll have a lot to do in order to really feel like you've finished with your journey through Tokyo chaotic and fresh streets. Sadly, story and characters don't exactly live up to the rest of the game, but if you can settle for a plot that's just ""Ok"" and play this gem to experience everything else about it, you won't be disappointed.. I honestly can't say more than that IT'S AN INCREDIBLE GAME It's one of the best games I've ever played I admit that I don't like JRPG RPGs but this game I fell in love with its characters, its art, its fighting system, simply incredible, I admit that every time I they revealed something my face was amazed because it is something that even if you have 200000iq it is impossible to know that it would happen very well developed and FOR ME THE BEST GAME I HAVE PLAYED. Highly regarded in some quarters, but this self-consciously ""cool"" pseudo-RPG did little for me. The constant pop music is irritating, the cut scenes nothing more than an endless stream of speech bubbles and the game itself just seemed to consist of one screen of ""scribble and stab the touch screen until the baddies are dead"" after another. Meh.. As a player who passed the game once I think the story and gameplay are very good, I understood the story at first, but I feel like it has a lot of text. it has a story that encourages you to continue and the art is incredible, if you have a ds or a 3ds get the game and enjoy it. The World Ends With You or ""TWEWY"" is a game that so masterfully utilizes being a DS game that I truly can't see it working on a different console, and I know that's true because they put it on other consoles and it wasn't as good. TWEWY follows a teenage boy named Neku Skakakabauab whatever his name is, a young anti-social kid who blocks the world out with his nice purple headphones, from the first moment of the game he makes it clear he doesn't want anything to do with anybody, which might be somewhat difficult as he's forcibly paired up with a girl named Shiki to fight these weird monsters called ""Noise"" using Pins, yes they use pins to do stuff like cast fire, electric, punch real hard, and use telekinetic powers and much more, funky concept I know. To use pins you have to use the DS Stylus in different ways on the bottom screen, all the while controlling your partner with the face buttons on the top screen, this is where the games challenge comes from, multitasking both characters on either screen, and it can take a while to get used to, but Shiki isn't too hard, just don't spam random buttons and you'll be fine. Shiki's attacks require you to put in button combos 3 times to get 3 cards so you can perform a big screen nuke together, it can be a overwhelming at first but you'll get the hang of it eventually. Making sure Neku has updated pins is also quite confusing, I handicapped myself for a few hours because I was using trash pins when I had much better ones in my inventory, keeping Neku up to date is necessary to win, as well as kitting him and Shiki out with new clothes to raise his passive stats. Shiki isn't the only party member though, the game is split up into Weeks, and each week brings a new companion, your second companion is Yoshiya ""Joshua"" Kiryu, a flamboyant kid with great hair and weird beam powers, the first day with Joshua can be quite rough as his combat isn't half as good as Shiki's, but once you get past a certain point he starts cleaning house, to the point I was neglecting Neku and nearly dying because their joined health bar was getting too low. On week 3 you pair up with Beat, a loud abrasive, beanie wearing angel who I would die for, his combat... ****, it's weird and confusing and he's the only one I ended up just button mashing through, his section is short enough and Neku's pins should be good enough that you can stumble through with brute force. As well as your three buddies you also get to meet Rhyme, an adorable small angel who I would ALSO die for, Uzaki and Kariya, your resident Jessie and James of this game and both are very fun, Sho Minamimoto, NEO fans will recognize him as a returning character in that game, Mr. Hanekoma, a man I wish was my dad, and a bunch of villains all equally as punchable, All in all a pretty great cast. The crux of TWEWY's story revolves around Neku breaking out of his anti-social shell with the help of everybody around him, being a Player in the Reapers Game allows him to hear others thoughts, this helps Neku to grow more empathetic, as he's forced to understand others in order to progress, while his new friends push him forward. It can be quite a powerful story if you relate to Neku's anti-sociable attitude, and even if you don't watching Neku go from an irritable closed off loner to somebody who genuinely cares for others and would risk everything for those people is great, a very heartwarming story. The World Ends With You is one of my favourite DS games ever and I'm so happy it got the sequel it deserved, I hope this series continues to rise in popularity, it really does deserve more than the cult following it currently has. If you have a DS I can't urge you to play this game on the original hardware enough, I think it's gameplay really does rely heavily on being a DS game and attempts to move it to other platforms simply don't match up. TWEWY is the golden standard for DS games in my eyes and a game I'll sing the praises of until the heat death of the universe.. Masterpiece, The best ds game and rpg ive ever played. It has style and the writing is either well done or so ridiculously over the top it's funny. usually jrpgs are not my thing. but when I saw this game, I felt a special connection I had never felt before. the game itself called out to me. good think I got it. art style? 10/10. soundtrack? legendary 11/10. gameplay? INSANELY FUN. just please do yourself a favor and GET. THIS. GAME. if you have to, buy an entire ds or ds lite to play this game. just freaking play it already!!!!!!!!!!!!. One of the best, if not the best NDS game, imo. controls have steep learning curve for sure, as you will need to switch your focus on 2 screens. touch controls are very responsive, you'll just have to be mindful of the pins that you are using, to make sure none of them works against each other. The story is great, the presentation, the soundtrack are really perfect. However, the most important part of the game, is its message, and its perspective to IRL society. It's a must play for all gamers at least once, for its uniqueness. There is no other game, literally that would play the same as TWEWY.. To be honest, the Nintendo DS in my opinion didn't have that many good games, but my opinion on it not having good games was changed after I played The world ends with you. TWEWY makes excellent use of the DSs duel screens with you controlling Neku on the bottom screen using the stylus and a partner on the top screen using the D-pad. While this may turn players who aren't used to multi tasking, you are able to make your partner fight own their own while you focus on on the bottom screen. Personally I played the game by focusing on the bottom screen and letting my partner run wild on the top screen. While that may make me not so qualified to review this game, but that feature is in the game for a reason. Of course the game has problems that are personalized to the player in terms of did you play the game by multi tasking or focusing on the bottom screen. For the bottom screen problems the biggest is that sometimes the ai of your partner is kinda dumb, but that doesn't take away from this absolute master piece. Personally I enjoyed the game, recommend the game to every one who is able to play it and am happy to add it to my gallery of my favorite games of all time.. Best DS game so far from my point of view. It's unique, original, deep story, troubling but dynamic gameplay. Never have I played such an original A-RPG. Solid postgame, the difficulty can be adjusted at every moment and that's an excellent option to have.. Story, music, graphics, refreshing gameplay, everything in this game it's just perfect and is one of the greatest JRPG on history.. For me this game is one of the best on NDS and the best jRPG of all time (I really dislike this genre, but games like this one are good exception).. A good JRPG with unique game mechanics. Besides the annoying badge leveling system and balance between various badges, everything is perfect in this game.. This game is the epitome of overhype. Did they need to sell a bunch of units so they got a bunch of good reviews pumped out? How is this supposed to be a fun game? I would love to just have ANY idea of what the hell is going on. The storytelling is loose at best. Not giving the viewer information does not make something mysterious or interesting, it’s just bad writing. I feel like people just give this game good reviews to pretend to be apart of some exclusive club that “gets” something the rest of us idiots don’t understand. Right. Bad game.. Great game, honestly the best RPG for the Nintedo Ds, Great characters, good plot twists and a great story. This is the best game i have ever played. Really, you won't find anything like this masterpiece, in this game a lot of new mechanics and they work very well. Of course TWEWY has minuses, but who cares if you won't don't pay attention to them. **** in this game grinding is interesting too, so i highly recommend to play this game , you won't regret, trust me and your partner). It is one of best DS games. Square Enix nailed it. I the story and the game play is awesome. You will also fell in love with the characters. The soundtracks is really astonishing. Great game indeed. I highly recommend it.. This game is gorgeous, I love it all! The aesthetic, the soundtrack, the characters, the town, everything. This game is just perfect.. The World Ends With You is a fantastic example **** JRPG everyone should give it a shot however don't buy the mobile version as it is $18 The story is great the characters are likable and the gameplay is fresh and fun.. Great game for the DS and one of the best games made by Square Enix. If you like JRPG and haven't tried this game yet, go for it.. Game: The World Ends With You Genre: RPG Developer: Squareenix System: Nintendo DS (NDS) Total Score: 91/100 Value Score: 9.1/10 Length of Playthrough: 25 Hours • Story: 10/10 • Characters: 10/10 • GamePlay: 7/10 • Graphics: 10/10 • Sound: 10/10 • Music: 10/10 • Length: 8/10 • Replay Value: 7/10 • Player Value: 9/10 Pros +Fantastic plot and characters +Great setting and great art style +One of the best OSTs ever +Multiple difficulties +Interact with players or if you have certain Pins equipped while not playing, the number of days decide how many PP (Pin Points) you get to level the Pins. +Replay value includes the option to replay older chapters (days) to do special missions to get Secret Reports which explain the story a bit more Cons -The ""Stride Cross Battle System"" is complex and can be irritating at times especially since your ally on the top screen can cost you a fight -The major mini game Tin Pin is pretty horrible and gameplay is very complex/annoying -Touch screen controls is hit and miss type of deal with some commands not being read. For me, the World Ends With You is a perfect game. The story and characters are among the most fun and engaging I've ever seen in a game, and the story progresses in a manner that's perfectly paced and puts you on the edge of your seat. The atmosphere of TWEWY oozes style. Everything from the music to the graphics and visual style absorb you in the games rich, urban world of mystery and beauty. The combat is amazing with the touch controls and top screen partner gameplay working flawlessly. There are so many pins to collect and level that the gameplay has endless variety. I can't think of anything that could have made TWEWY better than it already is.. Very fun yet odd JRPG, has a somewhat stereotypical storyline where the character learns to trust people, make friends, etc. But the gameplay is what really got me into this game. I can pick up this game anytime and still have tons of fun for hours on end. It gets somewhat repetitive, but for JRPG, it has much variety, from attacks, clothes, to food. There is a lot of fun in replaying this game, i have replayed it at least twice, my friend even replayed it 5 times and is considering it again. If you are a fan of obscure JRPG's, and are willing to either mash through a lot of text or get into the storyline, this is a game for you. My only complaint with the game is that there's no sequel!. With a great premise filled with interesting characters, fun and creative gameplay and a fantastic soundtrack, this game is something special indeed. The only issues with it are that you can´t skip any cut-scenes, which ultimately reduces the replay value, and on very few occasions the game did not respond correctly to the touch controls. But these are minor flaws in an otherwise excellent game.. So you will know what type of gamer is writing this review, I'll list three of my favorite games. Danganronpa Atelier Totori Fire emblem THE GOOD: MUSIC: Music is top notch, from rock and roll to rap music. GRAPHICS: The art style is unique, most everyone is skin and bones. The graphics are what you would expect from Nintendo DS. This game also has a unique vibe that you will only get from this game. A somewhat emo thug feel. GAMEPLAY: The game play is awesome and the level up system is great. I'll delve more in to gameplay further down. STORY: The story is awesome. Above the usual. ENDGAME CONTENT: There are extra bonuses once a play through has been completed, which allows you to unlock some extra story. GAME LENGTH: About 20 to 25 hours long but that doesn't include the endgame content. THE BAD: There is nothing bad to list in my opinion. IN DEPTH REVIEW: The game play breakdown is this, you control two different characters, each on their own screen. The top screen is your partners screen where you use the cross pad or the buttons to control them. They can attack by pressing left or right, and can jump, block, or dodge by pressing down and up on the cross pad. You can build up a special move to unleash on the top screen by various methods throughout the game. They are fairly simple to build up, but can sometimes get to be too much when you also trying to pay attention to the bottom screen so you may just want to put your partner on auto pilot. You can turn this future on and off whenever you like. The protagonist has the bottom screen in combat. He can attack using pins, which are basically moves he can use by different methods of using the stylus, such as tapping an enemy or scratching an area or slashing across the protagonist to fire bullets in the direction of the slash. There are many pins which you can upgrade and sometimes evolve. One even requires you to shout into the microphone of the DS. The protagonist can also dash by being dragged with the stylus which makes him invulnerable during the dash. The level up system is very nice also. You can level up the pins which will sometimes evolve. You can also feed the protagonist and partner which boost their stats permanently. You also can equip four different items to the characters which increase stats and sometimes a ability such as extra defense or more experience gained in battle and many others. That wraps this review up, a truly great game that I would recommend to anyone. You can even find it in Gamestop quiet often for a rather cheap price.. SO much awesome is jam-packed into one tiny cartage. The music, style, game-play, and plot-twists kept me playing until the very end. The only thing I don't like is how to get a couple of the pins, through a defunct online system or a social system. As a completionist it irks me that I can't really get that 100% for the pins.. The unique combat system plays like a dream, and the stylized atmosphere is also unique. But it's definitely dialogue-heavy, which can be a turn-off for many gamers. It's ultimately too slow for me.. There is no game out there like TWEWY, for a fact. The game's got upbeat, hip hop/street music, graphics resemble that of a manga or comic, and the combat is like no other. The combat consists of multitasking and fighting as two players -- slashing and tapping the bottom screen while using the ABXY/DPad for the top screen. The battling is addicting, the characters are unique, and the storyline is surprising. TWEWY is remarkably different than any other JRPG game, because you can't find a game with the same feel or combat as this one has. But that's the one con of this game; you'll be sad that there is no TWEWY sequel to enjoy after finishing this one. Square Enix, whyyy!! :'(. At first I figured that this was another one of those dumb cheapy games. I was wrong! The story was very creative and amazing! The gameplay was quite nice also. Not much replayability though. After you beat it there are just some extras that aren't my taste.. Hard to get used to but when you do its awesome! Story is top notch and writing is awesome! Awesome combat system once you get used to are great!!!! 10/10 most own if you own a ds! !. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Twewy is one of a kind for the DS and should not be skipped. The gameplay is unique and refreshing with both stylus action on the lower screen and combos performed with the directional pad on the upper screen simultaneously. The story is exceptionally beautiful and it is very easy to get attached to the characters.. This is probably one of the few games I completed a majority of the post-game bonus content in, because it was actually fun to keep exploring this world and push myself in. This game had probably one of, if not the most impressive stories for the DS, and amazing gameplay to back it up. The art style was also perfect for the setting, and really created its own personality. This was one of the must have games for the DS, period, and there's many reasons to play it over and over again. Art: 9 Music: 9 Story: 10 Gameplay 9. Its not exaggerating to call it one of the best games on the NDS, The World Ends With You brings a refreshingly new game play experience for the JRPG genre, and one of the games that make full use of the NDS dual screen function. Not simply pure game play, the game brings along a great music collection and a fantastic storyline. While the story was not particularly long, its short,straight to the point and you would've understood the plot and its details by the end of the game. After the end game, there also reports to collect to as unlockables for more details, and even a special chapter. Overall, a good game and challenging experience as its a new type of game.Worth a pick up.. One of my favorite games ever! This game has an amazing plot and while some of the characters might seem annoying they become really great once you get to know them. The combat is great and never gets old. An enjoyable feature about the combat is you can choose when to fight instead of happening randomly (except for a few fixed encounters). The pins are really interesting and are enjoyable to collect and fight with. Aside from gameplay the story is amazing and I really hope for a sequel.. This game is amazing the ending shocked me and it was a very beautiful game with good graphics. The story was not only great but it also influenced me to stop being so anti-social. All of the characters were very interesting and realistic (even Shiki and Beat). The soundtrack fit the game perfectly and the combat system was one of the most unique I have seen before in a JRPG. This is without a doubt the best game for the DS and is one of my favorite games of all time.. This was likely my biggest disappointment in the DS, especially given the excellent reviews it got. The World Ends With You is a wannabe RPG that tries to be unique and goes too far. The dialogue is tedious and often meaningless (and there's no way to skip it), the gameplay is repetitive, the screen is incredibly convoluted at all times, and the setting, while showing promise, ends up a drag to anyone who doesn't have a particularly big interest in the fashion and habits of Japanese teens. Admittedly, the storyline is delightfully weird, if not particularly well presented (see the boring dialogue comment above), and is likely the best part of the game. However, the gimmicky gameplay makes it difficult to actually see it through the end.. Great and different story and a style of its own. The scenery and music are perfect for this kind of story. Loooots of pins to try out that make the battles more fun and a great quantity of things to do even after beating the game.. This game is way too awesome to even review, if you don't own this and Ur RPG fan and u have a Ds, u should should drop everything and just go buy the game. Perhaps the best RPG Square has put out since FFVII. The first time I played this game, it was all I did for a week. I played it over a Christmas break, literally non-stop. The sound track is amazing, the story has a fascinating concept, and the game play is new and different, not to mention delightfully challenging. Admittedly it does subscribe to a few of the classic JRPG tropes, but I feel as though they are welcome tropes for this game, because they aren't half-assed--it does them well.. Easily one of the BEST games, let alone of the DS, the history, completely amazing and original story and character development with a nice gameplay. Definitely a must-have for JRPG fans.. A great addition to Square Enix's library Original and fresh. A fantastic soundtrack, engaging story line and genuinely interesting characters. An intriguing and difficult to master battle system helps provide a solid gaming experience. Whether you're a lover of RPG's or not, this game will quickly enter it's way into your favourites. For those whose nightmares are haunted by stat screens, text, and a major lack of guns, steer clear.. Really great battle system that took coordination of both hands and screens. Some of the puzzles were good. The trivia quizes you had to pass in order to advance in the game were lame.. This game still remains as one of Square's finest stories since Final Fantasy VI. The characters, while admittedly stereotypes, do not feel forced or convoluted as characters. They all have struggles that they have the desire to overcome, and believe it or not, the mounds and mounds of exposition that comes out of these character's mouths, while slightly annoying, only helped to drive the story home. With that being said, though, the combat and customization in this game are also very top-notch. Having the ability to multiply the base attacks of certain-brand pins in this game really adds a dash of power when this game is in the hands of a dedicated player. Long story short, this game was amazing to me. It rose above all expectations and truly delivered a powerful experience straight from the minds of Square Enix.. A year ago, I had zero interest in this game. But when it was revealed characters from the game will be appearing in Kingdom Hearts 3D, my curiosity of the gamme grew. So I finally got it, and I loved it! Great story and characters! A must have for anyone who owns a DS!. Finished playing TWEWY yesterday. I can safely say that this is the single most overrated game I've ever played. No, it isn't BAD, but for the amount of acclaim it receives, I'd definitely expected much, much more. My main grief lays within the combat itself. You collect pins which provide your main character with special powers, like casting a path of flames or striking your opponent with a meteor. Your partner takes the top screen and can be either controlled by CPU or using the D-pad. The battles are conducted in real time. Sounds about good, right? Wrong. The matches are not only extremely boring and repetitive, they also take absolutely 0 brain to play. I button mashed my way to victory from the first day to the last boss included, and this was on HARD difficulty. Don't even get me started on Normal and Easy. The enemies (called The Noise) are of little variety. Well over a half of monster list is hogged by the recolours of the same beasts you have fought at least 3000 times before. There is also a little minigame called Tin Pin Slammer which I guess was added in attempt to prevent the player from falling asleep from boredom. Unfortunately, it is so bad it is almost physically painful to play, and worst of all, the games DOES force you to play it at least a few times during the storyline, and trust me - you will hate it. To keep this review from being a mudsling-fest, the gameplay admittedly does have a few shining points. One good part is the importance fashion plays in this game. Each zone of the Shibuya has trends going in it, which determine how powerful the pins are in the battle. Strong brands have their attack doubled, whereas weak brands - halved. There are also tons of fashion items to buy and collect from the in-game designer shops, which work just like your typical RPG armour and provide additional perks to your character. Next, the plot. If you've read the manga ""Duds Hunt"", well, TWEWY is basically it, expect toned down to keep the 12+ age rating. Square Enix went a bit overboard with the dialog, but since the characters are fairly likeable you will read through them anyway, if only to learn more about their backstory. The A/V is a bit of a mixed bag. Unlike most DS games (hell, most games in general) TWEWY uses full recorded songs with lyrics. While the idea itself is fresh, the hip-hop / j-pop / j-rock beats might not suit everyone's tastes and there is no way to turn them off. The graphics are in 2D and have aged badly since 2008, but I'm not much **** **** so it didn't matter that much. At the end of the day, TWEWY it's an interesting concept ruined by horrible gameplay. Stay away from it if you value gameplay over story (like you should) and for those looking for a good plot, go to your local book store and buy some good literature.. This is my favourite JRPG! Great storyline, awesome characters, the gameplay is great and the animations are excellent! Square-enix should remake it for the wii u.. This DS gem from Square Enix proves that the company is not dead yet. Featuring a unique combat system, plenty of customization and an interesting setting (Shibuya, a popular shopping district in Tokyo), this is not a title to be missed. The story follows the struggle of Neku Sakuraba, an introverted boy who finds himself in a Shibuya where no one seems to notice him, and soon enough he realizes that other people are stuck in the ""Underground"", leaving only one way out: completing the Reapers' trials. A lot of people complain about Neku's personality at the start of the game, but this is something that actually changes as the plot progresses because he becomes much more likeable. The action takes place on both screens - Neku being at the bottom using ""pins"" and their powers to defeat the Noise that is sprawled throughout Shibuya, and his companion being at the top using a series of button combos for best damage output. It seems chaotic at first, but the truth is, veterans of the game will tell you to focus less on the action on the top screen because the Auto-fight feature will take care of it to a certain extent, meaning you can focus more on Neku. What I found appealing is that you can change the difficulty level once you progress further into the game, as well as Neku's level (i.e. if Neku were level 20 I could set it to 15 for an extra challenge). The lower your level and the harder the difficulty, the better drops enemies will yield. I could go on and on about the features, the things you can do after the campaign, the awesome mini-game... but you'll just have to find out for yourself.. Want to play one o","the world ends with you is a spectacular****'s amazingin pretty much every aspect . the story is about a teenager named Neku, who got trapped inside the ""Reapers game"" you fight as Neku, using ""pins"" that have their own unique pcych ."
57.Madden NFL 2002,The best madden game ever!!!! The game is so fun!!! I wish EA did games like this again!!!. My first Madden I have ever played and definitely one of my favorite ones. The only problem I have with this game is the QB accuracy and the amount the deep balls that you connect constantly with DB not being as in coverage as in future Madden's. But other than that I no problems with this game. Definitely a classic to keep playing over and over again.,my first madden I have ever played and definitely one of my favorite ones . the only problem is the QB accuracy and the amount of the deep balls that you connect constantly .
570.Torchlight II,"Actually a fun game that can still be played in 2014 due to its cartoonish **** is very similar to Diablo 3, it just looks different.Nothing groundbreaking here, but nothing bad either. A solid 7/10.. This is one of the best gameIhave ever played in my childhood.Thegraohics are awesome with cool characters and **** voice were awesome and the developers were good at their work and the game is favourable for all ages. One Minute Review: Torchlight II is an ARPG, built in the Diablo mold, released in 2012. This sequel improves upon the original in almost every way, such as adding online Co-op. It's got a great visual style, the environments are colorful and interesting - and the game is simply fun to play. While light on story, TL2 has 4 different character classes with tons of interesting abilities. After the 20ish hour campaign, you can choose to keep leveling to 100 and hunt for perfect gear with the Mapworks endless mode, or restart the story in NG+. There are a few flaws - too few classes and limited stash space, as well as no respec option - For a loot driven game with so many cool skills, not being able to experiment more was an odd choice. That being said, a very active Modding community solves ALL those issues, and adds lots more to the game. The difficulty level is a bit strange: normal can feel too easy, veteran can feel too punishing. However, even now, Torchlight 2 is one of the best ARPGs available if you're looking for an alternative to the big names.. A bit of a let down for me, as the original was one of my favorite ARPG's at the time. It still is pretty good, but I never really felt any of the classes were that fun to play, as they were just ok at their best and awkward at their worst.. We can consider Noor Mashal as the biggest competitor of one of the best franchises in history, Diablo, which was able to turn itself into a great competitor for this franchise by masterfully modeling Diablo.. This is the real Diablo 3 or even Diablo 4. It gets so many things right on a much smaller budget, I got this game and Torchlight 1 for $20. The game is fun, the drops and builds are creative. The graphics are good and will age well as they focus on being more cartoon like verses realism. The story is forgettable, but you will still enjoy the world. The mod community has added much replay value. The synergies mod will add hours of replay. IMO this is one of the best ARPG's out there.. as for me, this ge is better than diablo, but developers ruined it with missing of support. A worthy continuation of the first part, as for me one of the best series of games in this genre, on a par with Diablo and the rest. I was pleased with the new graphics, new classes, levels and stylization, a variety of monsters and loot. A meager set of really useful skills did not upset much, but do not forget about mods and end-game content. Gladly replayed more than once ;). Great game if purchased on sale! Much like the first, it continues the story and introduces new characters.. Torchlight II is an action role-playing dungeon crawler video game developed by Runic Games, released for Microsoft Windows on September 20, 2012. It is the sequel to Torchlight, and features peer-to-peer multiplayer support and extended modding capabilities. Torchlight II takes place in a fantasy world where the player character can be any of four classes, each with different skills and abilities. The plot starts with the destruction of the town of Torchlight, at the hands of the Alchemist from the first game, and has the character following the trail of destruction left in the Alchemist's wake as he searches for a cure to his illness which has driven him insane.. Highly Recommended : 10/10 1. Graphics : GOOD 2. Gameplay : GOOD Definitely worth a try !. Average game. It's an Hack And Slash action rpg....Diablo clone for short..., with cartoonish aesthetic, fast combat, medium lenght story. It ins't a AAA title , it does not innovate any aspect of this kind of games (grapichs, gameplay, difficulty, options, variety) but it does his job at a decent price. Loot isn't obsessive. I played it , ended it and i will probabilly never play it again.. Torchlight 2? More like horse-sh$te 2. No? Fair enough. Some jokes need more essence, and some jokes need more-spite 2. Still no? Fair. I won't pretend I enjoyed this game, but I'm not one to pretend I can't see what others enjoyed in it. For those who aren't against top-down, action RPGs but aren't totally into them either, this one may be a miss. It's easy enough to understand, but also not particularly rewarding enough to those who only understand, and don't already mesh with this type of game. Just thought I should mesh-tion that. STILL no? Come on, that one was decent. Fine. If you don't want my sh^tty jokes, then you can have my even sh#ttier opinions. Torchlight 2 is Torchlight but more open, and a few refinements. You may find yourself immersed with more character customisation options, nicer menus and UI, much improved world, character and armour design - and I'd like to emphasise that last one. You see, I'm a big patron of the idea that style and design trump graphical fidelity in games, and Torchlight 2 is actually a good example of that. The art itself hasn't much improved since your first wild encounter with it, but the way it's used has definitely seen an increase in quality. Respect, Torchlight 2. And to top it all off, there's more pet options here than PETA puts down in a week, and that's saying something. I picked an eagle and made him black so I wouldn't be too obvious in picking the Beagle. Now, I was always told if I had nothing nice to say, then say nothing at all, and I think I've said my share of niceties towards this game. It's time to say nothing at all. Nothing at all. Ha! Now let's complain. The first thing that comes to mind is that I loathe the boss fights in this game. Loathing isn't a word I like to describe my feelings towards anything but myself, so to use it now - that means something. I made no attempt to hide my dissatisfaction with the final boss of the last game, and so it seems they decided to turn that into every boss in this game. Seriously, Runic Games? You're gonna be so petty that you'd spite a review that wouldn't even be written until 9-11 years after the fact? Typical. Or delusional One of the two; I always get those mixed up. But f#ck me sideways with a butter knife covered in black tar heroin while sizzling on a hot summer's morning in the back of my Mum's dump truck; I hate these boss fights. I'll give exception to the Alchemist and the evil Robin Williams impersonator for limiting, or at least contextualising some of my eagle peeves with fun call-backs. But otherwise, do not play this game if you are like me (sorry to hear that), and dislike the following: Infinitely spawning adds, and infinitely spawning adds, and infinitely spawning adds, and infinite loops of this joke. And also marathon level health pools so that you can continue to deal with those infinitely spawning adds, and the infinitely spawning adds, and the infini- -you get it. Boy, do I love not feeling like I'm having an epic fight with a powerful enemy because I'm actually not. I'm just ignoring his few and forgettable mechanics outright and whittling away at his health every once in a while when I'm once again finished entertaining his kids. And by entertaining his kids, I mean murdering them brutally. I'm not holding my punches here because I have no respect for this type of boss design in general, let alone when it's the only thing that connects ALL the bosses together, moreso than the plot ever could! Anyway Once again, I picked the mage class and was disappointed that I could no longer create a dedicated summoner build like my character in Light of the Torch numero uno. But, I won't begrudge being pushed to try new class builds. Though I must say, I didn't find the leveling to be as fun as the last game. The scaling of the world and enemies is far superior to the bodacious curve of number 1, but at the cost of slower level gains. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I preferred the more rewarding system of the original, especially considering this game is longer so it's a less for more kinda deal. Like how I use less brains for more words on Metacritic than anyone else. Adding to this, the abilities feel less unique and varied, and there are fewer spells to find meaning I just wasn't as happy in the roleplay elements as I've been in the past. And maybe this is just because of my new, less... inactive playstyle compared to my summoner build but movement and combat just felt way harder to control this time round. The controls really could use an easy to access button that makes your character ignore enemies where your cursor is so you can actually move without your little idiot trying to attack each of the billion enemies covering your screen, while still having your mouse at the ready. Which you cannot. All in all, the only thing I can really say about this game is... nothing at all nothing at all nothing at all. This game is a passable Diablo clone. It was fun to play with friends. The game is initially a bit off-putting because it seems like all you do is click on monsters. However, after putting a few hours into the game you gain a bit more variety in your abilities. This allows you to apply some tactics in the combat and it becomes more interesting.. Standard Hack and slash but with reasonable depth and fast pace - the game runs fast and flows nicely. It allows you to take advantage of the pace of the game and dodge attacks, not through gimmicky skills, but with the way the game flows. Early game I attacked, attacked over - late game I would move around, dodge and attack - there is a clear depth with the way the game flows and it is instantly rewarding - with fun as well as success. great art, models. The Bosses are really well done - the palette has great contrast and looks very attractive. Story is missable, though the different environments are nice to look at. Skills and RPG system is standard particularly from Diablo, though there are a lot of skills, each have their own use, and can be upgraded or leveled over. Music is Diablo II with the enchanting guitar themes. They are all really good passages and I did not dislike the music at all -though the boss fights can get repetitive -though the passages were likable. I don't have too many complaints with Torchlight II actually and think it's worth a play through for anyone. However late game you will be ruled by knowing what stats you have; not unlike any other good RPG.. The best RPG game I've ever had the opportunity to play. Great classes, missions, skills, opponents and characters. The option to play online makes the difference and the addition of mods helps to make the game more flexible.. Good sequel to fun Torchlight I, that builds on it's predecessor. Just like in the previous game, I like pet's that make inventory management a whole less of a hassle. The story is bacic, almost non-existing but that's a norm for this type of games.. Hack and slash games can often be tedious, unless the game offers a good atmosphere or more sophisticated gameplay. In my opinion, Torchlight II offers none. Charming graphics remind me of World of Warcraft / Warcraft III. I liked the idea of having a pet and being able to send him to town to sell your loot, but aside from that, the game is quite bland. Skill tree is not well balanced and some choices are way more powerful than others. The whole game is just going to places and madly left-clicking on your enemies, in addition to spending a good amount of time selling your loot. My friend and I decided to quit halfway through, finally admitting we were simply not having any fun. There are hack and slash games I have enjoyed in the past (Diablo, Silver, VtM: Redemption, Path of Exile, Grim Dawn to name a few…), but this one pales in comparison.. Torchlight II is a fantastic game! As a hardcore Diablo fan, this game is an enlightenment in many aspects. While it isn´t innovative at all, it doesn´t has to be because it does so many things right. The action is terrific and the RPG elements complement the wonderful experience. The best thing is, that you can jump from single-player to multiplayer mode seamlessly. Check this extremely well balanced action stuffed point and click RPG out! You won´t regret it!. A great game with a lot of mods to experiment with. Can provide easily hundreds of hours of fun. No online only / economy BS like Path of Exile. Suprising depth, although strange scaling and character development systems. Playing this in 2020 and still holds up great. Id say if you like Titan quest / Path of Exile / Diablo 2 etc.. you will love this.. Very boring Diablo 3 Ripoff game. So easy you can play with closed eyes. 30 min played and I just uninstalled it.. The game is boring and very shallow. D2 was more climatic. It is probably not worth your time.. I really like Torchlight 2. It is very good action RPG. For me to a perfect 10 it lacks only more responsive combat which feels a bit sluggish in comparison to D3, Grimm Dawn or PoE. Its story could have been a bit better too but the story is not something I look for in aRPG games.. Much like Diablo 2 did, second Torchlight goes for more, bigger, better and... it works! Resulting in a game with a lot more variety, there is a lot to hack and slash here and seems like every aspect of the game has been refined, even if just slightly. Also, there is an alpaca pet. I really think this is very important to mention.. Very addictive game. You can start playing not knowing anything about the game, you don't need to read any text in the game and just sometimes look on loading screen tips and you are good to go for the whole game. The simplicity of the game help you get into it but you stay for the graphics, smooth gameplay, great map design with new things behind each corner. And of course there is RPG progression system that lets you play game with so many different play styles at first glance you have only 4 classes but more you play more you understand there is much more possibilities. Overall great game with only minor issues like not being able to respect your skill points or seeing a lot of look alike monsters but that!s just my personal view and i still enjoyed this game a lot.. I absolutely loved the previous game and looked forward to the next iteration with great anticipation and it failed to disappoint. To quote Cartman, this was ""hellafun."" TL1 was close to perfect and they improved it here. This is what all gaming should be: addictive, inspired and sublime.. TL 2 is a great gem. It is not so popular, but it is one of the best HacknSlay ever. This game is focused on gameplay and it is perfect: everything fits together: lot of items, many monsters, great character development with a lot of skills, spells, levels, few attributes and even a pet. It makes this game a bit more complex than some other hacknslay games (especially like Diablo 3). Like in Diablo 2 I had a lot of fun to get the next level to improve my character and feel the little improvements. And it is a lot of fun to compare the items and think which one fits better. Another big advantage TL 2 has is the great support for mods. So you can change some gameplay mistakes, add many classes and play as you want. I recommend Synergies, Essentials, enhanced retextures, bagmod, and the Far East Pack. There is a limit of 10 mods and it is a great idea, because people are forced to make mod packs, so that users dont need to collect dozens of mods, but just few of them. There is only one mistake this game has: the story is simple and the presentation of the story is too cheap. If there were some cinematics and more complex characters, the game would be the #1 of all time. But because of that it is ""just"" one of the best.. The game was really boring and I always felt like I should be more powerful than I was. The end was okay, but the journey along the way was way too slow. The gear is not rewarding enough to make me feel like coming back for New Game+. I almost quit after the second act but wanted to at least finish the main story. In the end, I am glad it's over. The engine dips in performance a lot in single player, I can't imagine how bad it must be in multiplayer. The boss fights were the only fun parts of the game for me.. Best ARPG together with the latest version of Diablo III and Titan Quest. Contrary to Diablo III there is no annoying DRM involved. The game offers some wonderful levels and many hours of fun. Some levels feel too generic and the whole story is just plain stupid. Getting sets together is as annoying as in other games. But it's a hell of game, a true gem.. Great hack and slash fun. If you like games like Diablo you will love this. If you want a deep epic story and don't like grinding through enemies you should avoid this. Also, there is fishing!. This is a fun, stylish and accessible game that scratches that old school Diablo itch I have every now and then. It wasn't the most advanced in terms of graphics even at release but I had a crap computer anyway so that was fine. My one real complaint is that it isn't particularly challenging. Simple (if boring) builds can steamroll through multiple playthroughs with no problem. Still, this is a great game to pass the hours.. 10/10 Torchlight 1 and 2 are my favorite RPG games. -Classes -Character Customization -Quests -A pet to choose at the beginning (WOW) -Great weapons -Open world with endless gameplay and fighting. best rpg ever positive + loot feels better and cooler then diablo + sweet graphics + cool enemies + combat negative - story is not as good as diablo 3 but without the story this is the best rpg ever. ¡AMAZING GAME! I have spent many hours gaming this game and is a amazing adventure! Characters, world, look and feel, BSO, bosses... me score is a 9! :D. I play this game very likely, its great diablo experience as we know it from D2 with smart advantages of Torchlight, you can make your build with full impressions of Diablo 2 tradition. Is Torchlight 1 in better shape, bigger and deeper, don’t be discouraged by its simplistic graphics, is a huge RPG, addictive and really challenging, it is easy to start but as you progress it demands more attention and develop from your character, and if you want to continue NG+ you really need to know what are you doing, all of this, among the complete mod support makes it literally endless.. A significant improvement upon its predecessor, Torchlight II is a solid step forward on the road to the ideal ARPG. It's charming art style, overall fast paced gameplay and mostly forgiving features, including a choice of difficulty setting, also make it a good entry point for those new to the genre, as well as offering a good challenge to the experienced dungeon crawler. The major change this time around is the addition of up to six-player cooperative play online, where the first game bizarrely lacked any multiplayer at all. The story is still somewhat sparse, again shoehorning the player into the role of damage control regarding the actions of a villain who, infuriatingly, will always look cooler then your character, and your character has no spoken dialogue with other characters. The classes do however have satisfyingly varied and powerful abilities and the combat feels very chunky, thanks to good sound design, enemies exploding on a critical kill and an overall focus on powerful single attacks. However, this installment inherits some of the first game's biggest problems: you are required to mainline potions to both to stay alive and keep your mana up, you may go hours without finding better gear and the champion monsters are much more powerful then the actual level bosses, sometimes outrageously so. I found myself dying regularly in the final act even on normal, though this costs you nothing should you choose to respawn in town, coupled with a total lack of an item durability mechanic (a huge plus that other games could learn from- I'm looking at you, Diablo 3). In addition, only unique gear is actually flavored towards your class, leaving you looking like a scrappy scavenger for most of your playthrough. You can also only refund your last three skill points spent and cannot redistribute your attribute points at all. Any of the above issues are easily remedied by using the game’s integral mod support or the Rapid Respec editor, the latter of which also allows you to resurrect a dead “hardcore” character. After playing through the game once as an Engineer without mods, I played as an Outlander using several mods, most notably a ""double points"" mod that gives you 10 attribute and 2 skill points per level, and a mod that scales all enemies and bosses to your current level whenever you enter a different zone. Having the right mod setup really enhances the game experience overall and I recommend giving it a shot as soon as you feel comfortable doing so. The pet system remains very useful, now including the ability to have your pet buy potions and scrolls for you in addition to selling your vendor trash, and this time around it seems your pet can take more then being looked at funny before losing all its health. This game also retains the absolutely enchanting musical talents of Matt Uelman, the music man behind Diablo's equally compelling soundtrack. In spite of its problems, Torchlight II is an excellent title with excellent mods, and well worth your time.. It's a Hack n' Slash (so you spend half your time mass-killing things) posing as an RPG (so you spend the other half reading piles of numbers inside your inventory). It does what it says on the cover, and it does it well, like its predecessor. It makes you click mindlessly everywhere and constantly, while keeping you under the illusion that you are smarter than your neighbour because you put 1 point in some attribute instead of another. I had fun for a few hours watching my alpaca headbutting beasties into corpses and corpses into dust while its pet, a female engineer, displayed her terrible aiming skills with a gigantic wrench. Torchlight 2 has a few qualities, yet has kept all the flaws of the genre: - Boring loot, with tons of junk, each item with several lines of fraction numbers to compare. - Tons of useless consumables - Tons of useless features, often 1 disguised as several (like enchantment rites and gem inserts) - Tons of useless restrictions - Useless merchants, offering nothing you'll want to buy, instead **** old scrap-monger. - Unrewarding rewards (mildly interesting when you are offered a quest, obsolete when obtained) - No saving, justified (by other classic design errors like randomising everything) but still Wrong 101. Funny that the only frustration from earlier games that the Torchlight series address belonged to RPGs (I'm talking about backtracking to sell loot from limited inventories.) The only Hn'S that address the Hn'S issues (and that I know of) are the DeathSpank games. I can finish a DeathSpank game, but with Torchlight, I always have enough after a few hours in.. You could dismiss Torchlight 2 as “just another Diablo clone,” but that’s missing the point of Runic’s action RPG. Instead of gothic horror, Torchlight’s world is bright and colorful, its sense of humor much more up-front. That makes the game approachable, even though it’s still huge, and when you finish the main game, mods add to the fun. Runic’s world is a joy to explore, and a huge improvement over the more basic dungeons of the first Torchlight. We love the frenetic energy of a six-player session, the constant hunt for new and better (and funnier) gear, and we love that the game is a fraction of the price of similar action RPGs. But mostly, we love the pet companions: every action RPG needs a pet that fights for you and sells your junk loot. Man’s best friend indeed.. Desperately needing a break from PoE and frustrated with Diablo 3, Torchlight II looked like a good avenue to venture down. Glad I did because even single player is fun, I was hooked all the way until high level and a full set of legendary items. I didn't think I would enjoy the graphics as much as I did, but they fit in well with this game and most of the scenery is cool to look at. The extras and secrets are rewarding and fun to go after and the boss fights are sometimes challenging. The map layouts and higher difficulty play can get a bit repetitive, but it never really gets in the way of the enjoyment factor. There are also mods available that make the adventure more interesting and co-op play is fun as well.. I'm big on all kinds of rpg games but this is one of the few where I actually levelled all the way up to Lv.100. I am still not fully done with this game. That alone speaks volumes.. The second installment of the Torchlight series, Torchlight II, is definitely an enjoying Japanese-style fantasy strategy role-playing game that any RPG gamer will love.. Really dove into Torchlight 2 while waiting for a content patch in Diablo 3 and Im not disappointed. A fun adventure dungeon crawler-esq game with a different art style. The Classes are limited to only four choices but there is much room to expand in those classes to make a character different from another. ( Also plenty of Mods that add classes etc etc ). Story wasn't grasping and intriguing as I enjoy but I was able to overlook that and have a enjoyable time playing the game. They also have additional content for when you complete the main story to have the player keep playing. Pets were a nice touch. The surprising amount of joy I received when a panda was a option for a pet.... Nothing really to comment about the Visual or Audio aspect, other then to note that the music in the Act 3 camp is the same music from a zone in Diablo 3. Coincidence? Who Knows.. I played it alone and it was fine didn't know what to do after a certain point so I didn't play much after that. Then I decided to go on the online part and everyone ended up being **** So I haven't played it in a while because I don't know what to do after you breast the main part of the game and got tired of childish ****. Compared to boring Torchlight 1, the second game is a blast. It's a really fleshed out hack'n'slash game that offers everything one could want from a such game. I think it's the first h'n's game since Diablo 2 I really enjoyed and finished more than once. Even the art direction of this series, which I dislike very much, wasn't enought to pull me off from playing it hour after hour, trying new characters and builds.. Firstly the cartoony graphics are ok at first, but are beginning to grate on me. Second there are many bugs and unintended game mechanics caused by bugs. Third, the game has no soul, there is basically zero memorable characters in the game. Fourth, even the supposedly low level monsters like a walking mushroom can shave off half of my life in one hit. And that's with a shield equipped. Just really frustrating and no fun at all.. That was all that I expected from the developers of Diablo 1 and 2. This is not a ""Diablo 2 clone"" this is ""another Diablo 2"", it seems that this guys are doing exactly what they know. Even the situation is the same, Diablo 1 with the traditional warrior, archer and mage crawling a dungeon, and Diablo 2 with completely different classes exploring four acts... they are just in their known environment repeating a successful experience, modernized and open to mods, I feel that Torchlight 3 will be the real Diablo 3.... In short, it's a simple hack & slash done right. If you like to kill hordes of enemies, gain experience, find lots of loot and have some great boss fights, this is the game. Visuals and overall playability are just great. That being said, don't expect deep story, interesting dialog or anything like that. The story is mostly irrelevant and there really isn't any NPCs to interact with or stuff like that.. The things that dissappoint in Torchlight 2 are the graphics, the soundtrack, the story and the voice acting. However, the gameplay is so addictive that these are overlooked. Hence 9 for an almost perfect game.. This game is a ton of fun to play. One of the best isometric-view CRPG games of all time! There is tons of awesome loot all the time, you are always finding new weapons and armor, items, etc. Its just a ton of fun. Great gameplay, evereything explained well. I love it. I put it up there with Diablo II and BGII, and, in some ways, it's better than both. An absolute blast to play. You'll scream through this game on normal with little to no difficulty at all so if you need a challenge, play on hard. I like Normal mode though, I'm just in it for the story progression, character progression, the loot, and the hack'n'slash action. This may be the best game available in this genre to some of you, depending on your perspective on these types of games. 10/10 from me. Where's Torchlight 3?!. Very charming, very motivating, and very much an alternative to the Diablo series. I could also say, that Diablo is an alternative to Torchlight, so convincing is this game! Every aspect of it works well, it's never disappointing, and it offers lots of diversion. Anyone who has some fun with this sort of games, should love it. Some of the bosses are a bit tedious, but oh well! That's Hack 'n Slay life. Only thing I personally don't like - just a matter of taste - are the cartoonesque graphics. Of course, this makes the game affordable, and it shouldn't matter - but still, it bothers me. Sigh.. The best game of its type, no doubt about it. It runs smoothly, the combat feels fast, challenging and engaging. You can really work at customizing your character and then feel the effects of it in combat. You really feel like you made this character, you build the machine behind the big numbers and bloody mayhem - that's the most important part of RPG games and people seem to forget that. Not here. Of course, this isn't the sort of RPG that draws you in with an amazing story, it's dungeon crawling, click and kill and that's fine. TLII never pretends to be anything else. It's driven by its mechanics and they're flawless. Excellent game.. This is what Diablo 3 should have been. It's brilliant and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the ARPG genre. Lots of innovative additions to the format, beautiful locations, wonderful classes with proper customisation and random levels - what more could you possibly want? Jimbo Rating: 10/10. If you were never a big fan of these types of games, I suggest trying Torchlight II. It might change your opinion of the genre entirely, like it did for me. I haven't found a single aspect of the game to gripe about yet, it's just incredibly fun all around.. Correct gameplay and visual effects. A max level higher than the usual 20~60 is a plus, as is optimized code, so that the game runs smoothly on normal PCs even when there is a lot of action. Graphics are sadly close to anime or game console, thus far from detailed graphics like, for instance, in Titan Quest or Neverwinter Nights. Pre-made classes is a very bad idea, especially if there are only 4 to choose from. This is ruining multi-player experience, where each player wants to be unique. Serious ARPGs offer several base classes and allow multi-classing, for a much deeper experience and added re-playability. Finally, buying a sword at the smithy and finding yourself fighting shooting helicopters and industrial machinery is not only boring, it is totally out of context and illogical. Because of such severe flaws, the game is not as addictive as a great ARPG should be, except maybe for kids or newcomers to the ARPG genre.. I've only played the game for 12 hours so far, but oh my god this game is amazing. There are so many quests and challenges that you'll need to overcome, with or without friends. I never played this with an","one minute review: Torchlight II is an ARPG, built in the Diablo mold, released in 2012 . it's got a great visual style, the environments are colorful and interesting . while light on story, TL2 has 4 different character classes with tons of interesting abilities ."
571.XCOM 2,"This score isn't reflective of XCOM 2's objective quality as a video game, because all the mechanics are very thought out and intricate that I can't help but admire how well everything works together. The low score is just because I just got really overwhelmed with the game. It's just me being bad at a game that is in a genre that I'm really new and unfamiliar to me. I played Mario + Rabbids and a little bit of Persona 5 Tactia and foolishly thought the pipeline would carry over into XCOM. Choosing this game to start off with is completely my own fault. That being said, I had a rough time. The game is really difficult, and it has a decently high barrier to entry. I constantly find myself unable to tactically complete a task without constantly getting my team wiped out over and over again. I want to come back and enjoy this game, but I admittedly don't have the patience to learn this game. I'm sure this game is an absolute blast and a half for those that are into these types of strategy games, but unfortunately this game just wasn't a good match for me.. I'd recommend. It isn't the game that got me into TBS, but I'm a loyal fan at this point. I just can't get enough - and I probably won’t with how many mods come out for this thing!. Its a very well made game with great combat mechanics and visuals the problem is the difficulty curve is very high. Even highly skilled players will have a hard time completing this one due to how unforgiving the combat is. Overall it had the potential to be a 9 or even a 10 if it wasn't so difficult to complete.. TL;DR: Overall a frustrating experience. I didn't find it too difficult in terms of skill or strategy. It is moreso difficult in the sense that the RNG and the algorithms behind the system make combat inorganically difficult. Therefore, many a time you will not feel rewarded for pulling off a slick and/or tactical team manoeuvre because you will miss your shots (even when your probability of landing a hit is over 80%) because the RNG ultimately dictates the flow of combat. When XCOM2 flows well it is a silky smooth experience and feeling. But, when XCOM2 doesn't flow well then it feels like you are forcing yourself into your tightest skinny jeans, and the only thing you will find there is hardcore chafing. Narrative: Generic naff. Boring characters everywhere, cliched tropes and uninspiring story-telling. I really disliked many of the cut-scenes in this game. Luckily, they are short and mostly skippable, but they are just annoying (the voice acting adds to that) over the top US military blah blah. I have to mention the final cutscene (which is hilariously terrible and immersion breaking for me) where regular human resistance fighters are regaining control over Alien Advent checkpoints wielding nothing but wooden baseball bats and metal pipes! Only 30 seconds ago, we, had to utilise advanced Alien Advent weaponry to just about defeat them by the skin of our teeth!Music/Sounds: Shame Firaxis couldn't invest in a badass soundtrack that fits the theme (or doesn't). Again, it feels very uninspiring and generic. You know it, the military orchestral sound that we see in the films time and time again. They could have got funky here with some rock and some sci-fi space sounding stuff. Music aside the sounds are pretty neat early on but it gets annoying pretty fast especially when it comes to enemies because they have no variation. The same shrieks, commands and grunts over and over again. Furthermore, the former Commander, your right-hand man, will not shut his trap. Seriously, please listen to a podcast or some music when playing this game, you will miss nothing. Gameplay Loop: There are some structural flaws because if you go into the game blind like I did; it is possible to hinder your progress quite deep into the game. I had maxed out my Comms network link without knowing about the Avatar project. So within the first 15-20hrs of gameplay I was dealing with the Advent Avatar project on a constant timer (as mentioned before your Commander buddy will not shut up about this). Luckily, I persisted and managed to reverse this but I can see many folks being deterred by this as it adds another layer of frustration to the game. Furthermore, the way missions are fed and the way you navigate the globe there is a very stop-start and fractured rhythm to the gameplay loop. To make all of this worse lets talk about the actual gameplay and how it fits in with the overall loop. I am relatively new to turn-based team tactical shooters; some similar games I have played are BG3, Persona 5, The Banner Saga series, The Civ series, Divinity Original Sin series, Invisible Inc., and the Crusader Kings 2. One thing I can say for certain is that XCOM2 is the slowest of them all in terms of combat flow and this has a major impact on how one will recieve this game. Animations take forever, getting into battle can take too long sometimes, if there are too many pods activated it will literally take 5-10 mins just for the enemies to end their turns, and, in the end all of this adds up to long battles that don't feel very mentally stimulating because of RNG having a chokehold over the fundamental mechanics. Combat Engine: Feels unpolished. Overwatch system is implemented poorly (even when done as an 'ambush'), the aim penalty makes the execution hilariously goofy especially since it triggers a cinematic slow-mo. Characters will miss point blank shots, your sniper will miss a massive golf ball shaped enemy that is 20 yards in front, grenadiers will waste 50 rounds of ammo on an enemy running from cover to cover 10 yards away!UX/UI: Overall it is fine on PC. I do have two things that irked me. Firstly, when at the Command Centre (where you navigate the ship on the globe) all the animations are just too slow. Which is a common issue as I have also mentioned this in the previous section. Moving from point to point on the map is gratingly tedious and this is further exacerbated by the fact that you will be interrupted relentlessly by other mission notifications. Secondly, the bunker view of the ship is a little dodgy to navigate as the camera loses control. Bugs: Some crashing over my play time, a couple of VIP missions are busted because you cannot actually reach the specified destination (from what I understand via reddit - this is exclusive to the game being played on Epic Games), some missions where there is lots of smoke effects did create some FPS drops and stutters but it didn't happen often.. Repetitive and difficult. With a couple of hours you'll have more than enough. I played for over 6 hours. It's the second time I get my whole team killed, so this was a sign for me to just quit. I don't think I'll ever play this game again. Lucky me it just cost me 2'5€ on Steam but even with this price I don't recommend spending your money on this one.. Welcome back, commander.XCOM 2 improves the XCOM:EU in many ways. Its graphics, sound and UI have stepped up. More emphasis is put on the story. Now XCOM is on the run, your base of operations is a giant repurposed alien ship. Through the hologlobe, you will need to move around the world tackling different missions and building a global resistance.Aircraft is missing in this sequel, but the rest is more or less the same. Lots of mini-games that, when combined, build a complex strategic game. Chossing missions, soldier customization, technology research... This time though, you must stop the aliens from completing a project, a counter is added to the campaign. Which means you need to fight against time in order to stop the aliens. This adds yet another mini-game, keeping track of this project's **** support is amazing, there is a lot to customize through it. XCOM 2 vanilla is not a bad game, but it lacks diversity. XCOM:EW felt better, **** expansion was launched, XCOM 2 War of the chosen is a must buy if you want to play this game, it adds so many new features and adjustments. It feels like a new game, way better than vanilla. New enemies are added, including three antagonists that will make your life more painful, and also new allies that will help you against them. A really complete experience and definitely a step up from the amazing prequel. If you want the ultimate XCOM experience go for war of the chosen.Good luck, commander.. Game is trash that doesn´t honor your time. Even on easiest difficulty you get smacked in your face. I tried It again and again and again and I´m too old to invest another 200 hours into a game just to ""get going"" I liked the first installment much more than this piece of trash.. Really good strategy and classes that makes a good combination. Interesting story and world. Camera controls are a bit iffy. Really happy with all the customization options.. very good strategy game with interesting lore. i love how you can get attached to your characters and then they **** die.. This is a great management and tactical combat game. War of the Chosen also adds so much interesting stuff that I feel it's a must. I usually get bored of tactical turn-based combat games very fast. This game, however, has the interesting aspect between missions that makes me want to keep playing and see how my campaign goes. This game is more of a campaign, but it still has random elements that will likely make you want to replay it. It's not quite a roguelike because the runs are too long (over 10 hours, more if you try to complete more stuff), but it has that feeling, due to the randomness of the map and events that show up. There's always something to do, and unfortunately, you won't have time to do everything. If you're a completionist, this might annoy you, but I found that it was interesting choices you had to make constantly.. This game is about battles for the sake of battles, and those battles are fun every time, until you get tired of them and then the game is over.. XCOM turned up to 12, but on amps that should really be at 10 max. It gets way crazier, but still follows the formula of being a strugglebus in the beginning to being a cakewalk without any challenge at late game.. Did not do it for me at all. Have tried multiple times to get into, but something about it does not grab me. I think the way timed missions force you to make risky decisions feels bad because soldiers getting wounded or dying can often have disproportionate consequences, but if I mod out the timer its obvious the game was designed with it in mind and it becomes too easy. Overall, just not for me. Too punishing in ways that feel unfair.. By 2023 this game has nothing but a famous name. By this point many xcom-like games are just straight up better. Mutant Year Zero as an example.. I really liked the game! Interesting plot, good characters and good graphics for the time the game was made! Thank you, very much dear developers!. generally, xcom 2 is a good sequel, with lots of new stuff, and new mechanistics, but there are at least two things which i consider negative. first, the constant time pressure. i know, it is supposed to be fun to solve problems under stress and with limited resources, but sometimes it is too much. the stupid thing of ""scanning"" the region to get smth eats time and makes the stress even pushier. the missions are jumping one after the other, it is difficult to decide which one is more important than the other. second, the very slow healing and shortage of staff, decimating the men without time and resources to improve armament, not funny at all. yes, i successfully finished it, but it was far less fun than xcom 1 aka enemy unknown. if i want a stress i go to wurck ;) third, last and least, it is still a bit buggy, especially the ruler aliens. well, i like to often replay xcom 1, but xcom 2 i tried to play only thrice.. This game only came out in 2016 but it just feels so old. It feels way older then it is. If it was made today I'd be all over it because you can't get better then this in this genre. If you like this type of game you have to play it, but for where I'm at right now and how much more there is to get through I just can't give up the time to this particular world. It's a good game but it feels 8 years older then it actually is.. disgusting trash disgusting trash disgusting trash disgusting trash disgusting trash. A great game, both visually and in terms of gameplay. Even after 6 years, it is still one of the best in its genere.. The game causes very mixed feelings. On the one hand, this is a good and modern representative of the turn-based tactics genre. In general, it is the restart of the XCOM series that the entire genre owes its recent revival. On the other hand, the game has a lot of game design decisions, and some things were done, and as if they didn’t understand why, and just scored. All in all, if you've played Enemy Unknown (the first part of the reboot), you won't see many changes. Whether it's good or bad, everyone decides for himself. The plot continues the events of the reboot and you will meet some familiar characters. But you need to understand that the plot here is basically banal and for show. There are few story missions themselves, basically you will play the same random events with generated cards. The graphics have become much better, despite the fact that the game is already 8 years old (at the time of writing this review), and its system requirements are weak. This is basically a rarity for tactics. The dynamic camera during shooting and just moving units is also pleasing to the eye. The visual customization of the fighters is also well done. But all this was already in the first part. The destructibility of objects at the levels is present, but not ideal, you can often see a situation where the wall and roof of the building are destroyed, and the boxes and partitions remain hanging in the air. But bad innovations, in my opinion, much more. These include absolutely system for calculating hits on the enemy. Units regularly and not on business smear, reboots do not save from this, despite the fact that sometimes the game looks like a simulator of eternal saves and loads. An annoying global timer on the world map - you can't calmly rebuild your base, do research and improve equipment, the game constantly pushes you to complete story missions, otherwise you simply won't have time and will have to start from the beginning. An even more annoying timer on almost all side missions, you are given a measly 6-8 turns to complete the task, otherwise the mission will fail. Because of this, you constantly have to substitute fighters in unfavorable combat situations, and as a result, lose them or get injured, and because of this, they will not be able to participate in other missions for a long time. And yes, the permanent death of units cannot be turned off, although even the famous and hardcore Fire Emblem has already allowed it to be done for ten years. The very number of additional missions and frequency of their appearance is annoying to the point of madness, and if you refuse them, you will simply start to lose funding for your organization from other countries and lose for economic reasons. The difficulty of the game is basically unpleasant, at least if you're not a **** of course, all sorts of unnecessary little things like mods for weapons and characters, they fall out extremely rarely, and they have few varieties, this is just the example when for some reason they made mechanics, but seemed to have scored on it. Of the minuses of both restarts, it is also worth noting that there is no action point system, and all actions are divided into two stages - movement and shooting. You can run far, but then you won't be able to shoot on that turn. Reloads, heals also cost precious actions. Classes like Snipers can't fire their primary weapons at all after moving or reloading, making the class's usefulness often questionable.There are people who like this system more than the famous AP, but here it is not implemented very well. To summarize, it may seem that the game has more disadvantages, this is not entirely true. I am sure that someone will like these innovations, especially lovers of additional complexity. If you are a fan of the genre, or you really liked the first part, then you need to try XCOM 2. If you are a beginner, then, probably, this is not the best representative of tactics from which you need to start acquaintance, your ass will burn and discourage all desire to touch other similar games. I can rate it 7/10, but I'm afraid it's not more.. An instant classic that refines, evolves, and redefines the ideas that came before. Strategy perfection. Very good TB strategy game, but the campaign is generic and not very interesting. I really don't want to make another playthrough.. XCOM is a game that has a lot to offer but needs far too much time for its formula to become satisfying, after the mid point of the game it runs out of curveballs to throw at you to keep the gameplay engaging and dynamic, so instead chooses to ramp up the difficulty. While I'm aware XCOM is known for said difficulty, it doesn't make the gameplay fun when everything is decided by a literal dice-roll yet is so unforgiving, you just end up feeling cheated. The game is optimized poorly for PC and had many bugs that forced me to abandon missions due to being soft-locked. While the setting, premise and first few hours of gameplay did a lot to salvage my opinion as a whole, the game falls off heavily as it goes on and by the end I was left disappointed. If you're a fan of RTS games then give this one a shot if it's on sale, otherwise I'd say don't buy it.. A great game if you are into the genre. In my opinion its leaning a bit too heavy into the overworld / basebuilding management wich is janky and tedious. Be warned there are quite a few bugs (gameplay / audio / visual). Also the combat could be sped up just a tiny bit. The optimazation is also quite horrible. I liked the high difficulty of each mission.. I have played this game for over 50 hours. At first I loved this game for the setting, level design and soldiers, I considered this game to be good and that it would become one of my favorites even then. But with every 5 hours of playing, I learned how terrible the gameplay of the game is and that this is one of the worst games I have ever played. Spoilers are minimal. 1) Even after releasing a large-scale addition to the game, the developers did not remove the huge randomness in shooting, when the machine gunner at point-blank range in 1-2-3 cells has a low chance of hitting and how miserable it looks in the game when he misses a huge alien that is standing right in front of him. 2) Bugs. They are everywhere. Bugs with shooting animations, bugs when the game is paused when there is a lot of shooting from spectator modes, bugs with grenade explosions, bugs with the abilities of the chosen ones, bugs when using engineers in the power relay. What the developers were doing preparing the addition to the game is unclear. 3) Stealth. It doesn't work normally. When successfully using stealth and bypassing enemy points, patrols at some point begin to go towards the player for no reason, and this happens all the time during missions with penetration to specific points. No logic, no development. Complete failure of the mechanics. 4) The worst is the sequence of moves, which is not reset if you are given an additional move of the last soldier for killing (for example), but the game does not allow you to do this and at that moment a plot event occurs (for example, the resurrection of the chosen one) and the game takes your turn, making a full one progress in the opponent's event, and you get back your half-one move left only for moving. As a result, the enemy makes literally 2 moves, until you absolutely could not do anything and this one does not depend on you in any way. Worst turn based game design I've ever seen in the history of gaming. 5) There is absolutely no tactics. It all comes down to random whether the enemy will hit through the cover / pass the stun / miss. The computer opponent does both completely stupid actions and brilliant ones at the same time, absolutely killing all the seriousness of what is happening, which you look at with laughter. Perhaps this is normal if you play on a low difficulty and score on logic and realism, but this is not interesting for experienced players. 6) Terrible development of the fog of war, when, for example, the Wanderers are close to Advent (which they also attack as a player), but until you open the fog of war, they just stand still and do nothing. And as soon as you opened it, they begin to act and then ignore the fact that they are point-blank to the enemy. They begin to stupidly run around and it looks like a clownery. And such missions also start in stealth, which absolutely destroys your tactics, since they can accidentally run out at the moment the fog of war opens and run out to you (although they break down exactly on the opponent of Advent according to the mechanics of the game when you are still in stealth). Summing up, I will say that this is only part of the problems and not all that terrible that is in the game design of the game. The game has a lot more problems and is more offensive just because the game initially seems good due to the setting and the design of the squad with the levels of locations. To bury such potential with such terrible gameplay I have never seen. I don't recommend anyone to play this. Not fun when all enemies are bullet sponges and your soldiers can't hit Sh**, and can all be killed in one turn if you are unlucky (which is what the core gameplay revolves around). Everything else is actually quite good, I enjoyed the stuff on the ship, such as customising your soldiers and upgrading your ships rooms. I also found the story/lore to be quite intriguing, which you get a lot of. PS, this game is hard AF (or just simply unfair/rng based), even on the easy difficulty.. Utter **** Controls are **** awful. no depth just full rush against turns all the time. cant spin the map or **** you chump. Even at £3 on steam or free on Epic its **** over priced. If you want cancer play this game.. XCOM 2 is a 2016 turn-based tactics video game developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K Games. It takes place 20 years after the events of Enemy Unknown. XCOM, a military organization trying to fight off an alien invasion, has lost the war and is now a resistance force against the occupation of Earth and the established totalitarian regime and military dictatorship. Gameplay is split between turn-based combat in which players command a squad of soldiers to fight enemies, and strategy elements in which players manage and control the operations of the Avenger, an alien ship that is used as a mobile base for XCOM.. Aiming system is rigged AF. Game has technical difficulties on Switch. So, lizards can pull you even from a rooftop? Who tf made that game? There is absolutely no logic in fighting system.. Xcom is disbanded and what remains is a small faction and underdog! then WHY THE HELL the mission REQUIRES me to both rescue hostage, and then KILL ALL Remaining enemies on map? Why can't i get the hostage and F off? Cause , everybody calls you the ""COMMANDER"" but Firaxis is the actual commander and Demands you what do as exactly told and dont accept anything else. First game was alright because it was based of some one else's work, now it s the second game and we all saw how moronic the melodies came out of their own guitar.. I fell in love with this game when I first started playing it, but then something went horribly wrong. If you only intend on playing the game once or maybe twice then this game is a fantastic gem; a great experience. If you want to play more than that then it has some surprises in store. First of all the UI and controls are ok but they could be so much better on the PC. Every once in a. Sometimes you can just tell when a game has been created with no love from the devs whatsoever. This was merely them doing their job.. good game with great combat, dk why the reviews are so bad ... xcom foreverrrrrr. One of the best (if not the best) strategy games of this decade. If you like turn based strategy / tactics games you need to try this.. One of my favorite games! I always have a good time with XCOM. Love the combat especially. This is what a strategy game should be. Multiple layers of decision making, consequences that ripple across all layers of the game, and the feeling that you’re constantly fighting a losing battle against an enemy stronger than you. It’s pretty much an arms race against the aliens, and you are at a disadvantage. I think iron man should be the default mode in the game, otherwise it takes away the huge sense of risk vs reward. This is easily one of my favorite strategy games - I have finished it for the fifth time now across three different platforms. I always come back to it.. The best turn based UFO Defence game that I've played. XCOM was Great. XCOM has further built up on it's strengths and created an even better product with Updated Graphics and Campaign. Every single DLC had a profound impact on gameplay and refined it even further. Grab the complete XCOM2 bungle for best experience.. Ridiculously difficult, the game can't compensate with its beautiful presentation, and fantastic sound design, for what it is essentially a game with deeply flawed gameplay and balancing options in regards to its level of difficulty, It's beyond me as to why developers choose to make their games as challenging only to then add difficulty options that, really, don't provide any difference when it comes to the overall difficulty of theg ame.. XCOM 2 is unbalanced piece of s.... DLC Bosses with three life strips for first-level soldiers is ""nice"". The game is going too fast, very few resources. Improvements are very expensive. The Avatar project... who invented it? Max honest rate no more 75. Bad job Firaxis. Recommend for fans of XCOM, it is definitely a worthy entry. Overall a good game, unfortunately my experience was marred by bugs. Every cutscene (story, resistance contact, surgeries...) had what felt like a 50% chance to crash my game. I appreciate the tactical approach and overall gameplay. Line of sight is somehow janky and not really intuitive. I would say succeeding in missions and winning the game feels satisfying. Menu navigation is slow and cluttered. Recommended mods: Faster Avenger Navigation; Stop Wasting My Time; Flank Preview. While the game is leaps and bounds better than the previous XCOM, I would be amiss to not recommend that you play the previous XCOM to get the full amount of enjoyment out of this game, as well as back story. The previous XCOM was badly designed around RNG, but this game has fixed much of that, allowing for strategy to be stronger than the ridiculous RNG missed shots. There is still times that you will miss that 99 percent success shot, but it isn't game breaking as it was in XCOM Enemy Within. The game is also far more inclusive to the tempo that you take the game, as opposed to feeling rushed in every sense of the way. The layout of the base is not make or break based on the layout that RNG gave you at the start as well. This makes it less stressful in starting the game, and wondering where a steam vent is, or if you can get that Sat link without the Steam Vent being in the way. The engineers and scientists are far more interesting and fun. I wish there was more we could do with them, but they are vastly better than just getting a number higher. In short, I enjoyed XCOM 2 vastly more than XCOM EU and EW. I definitely recommend this game, though wait to get the DLC/Expansions until they are on sale. They are quite overpriced currently.. This game is bad. Strongly not recommended. Everything inside is like a one big script (even shooting). 80-95% to shoot a target and miss. Load and one more try... miss again. One more try miss again and over and over again. You can move and shoot but you can't shoot and move at start. Many pointless skills. X-COM extraterrestrial gold edition is much better then this game (2007). Another game based on very good (legendary) title f...d up. Sad.... Love playing this game. One of my favorite games. Great graphics. Intriguing story. Very good continuation of Enemy Unknown.. Really liked this game, it follows the great gameplay of the previous game but it also adds the character customisation that is amazing, especially when you add multiple mods on top of it.. Even for it's love-hate situations it still dominates other games with the same genre of gameplay. No game has the magic like XCOM has. All cool things aside this game only made me frustrated, the main mission event is a time bomb **** you to stop the enemy project or you're gonna lose the game. The start was awful, I got short on the supplies immediately, therefore I had to skip a few missions so my squad can heal up. Luckily I started getting PTSD flashbacks from the old game and remembered the pattern. I can't imagine how a newbie would feel like playing this game for the first time. Most of the missions are turns limited, that means that if you overplay the amount of turns you are supposed to play, you will lose the mission and the squad too. Not fun at all. Also, everything depends on the percentage of how successful your soldier's aim will be, that means lots of save/load situations. Animations are very useless and time consuming, there is a mod that helps you to skip combat animations but somehow it doesn't work for me. After some hours you're just gonna get so sick of it.. Pc version is so much better than the ps4 one: loading times are so much lower and gameplay is smoother. Character creation mechanics of the soldiers is a great extra feature i wish many games of this kind had. Unfortunately sometimes walls do not properly block the line of sight of enemies, furthermore, the fact that the enemy level after level churns out stronger and stronger aliens reaches exaggerated levels and is unpleasant. Hey... Do you remember when Donald Trump, Darth Vader, Hatsune Miku and the Ultramarines saved the World ? Yeah... Me too... Coded with the feet and optimised with knees, this game didn't get any real update to solved it issues. Like an other game who likes to shoot you in the knee, you HAVE to install mods to get an acceptable experience : Balancing the game, Getting new classes, new weapons, new foes, new everything. The campaign is cool, the gameplay is okay... but it has some stupidities like stealth being misexploited. Soundtrack is great Graphism are mediocre. But hey, even Archer and his crew are joining the party ! Thanks 2K games, but a bigger thanks to the modders !. Continued and, in fact, a repetition of the first part. Few new ideas. But still good gameplay. For fans of the strategy and tactics genre.. I decided to write a separate reviews on the game in general and an DLC about the chosen ones. So about the game... Very good graphics worthy of 2016. Very interesting story and atmosphere through all company missions. New interesting idea with soldier's skill relationship, and with stress debuffs. Adding new fraction soldiers with their own specific skills. As usual, interesting text articles about laboratory projects. Some people complained on timers, but at first, it's a part of game-play and it's well described by game-play. And at second, you can alter them in option menu before starting new game. The avatar timer, what a surprise, was in the original game as ""panic bar"" and you can shorten it in some missions. What I actually didn't like in this game: Curved camera(the global map periodically runs from place to place, activation of some skills is not visible because the camera shows a completely different part of the location). Sometimes AI of aliens reacts slowly or even make foolish steps. When you step on the green square o",XCOM 2 is a very well made game with great combat mechanics and visuals . the difficulty curve is very high . even highly skilled players will have a hard time completing this one due to how unforgiving the combat is .
572.Dishonored 2,"this game obviously has its own genre . the majority of players would appreciate its different gameplay and there is no doubt about that , after all it can be a highly recommended stealth game ! but there is only one thing about this game i would like to share with you ! dishonored 2's storyline is not very engaging , it doesn't offer any surprises ; and it's predictable ! However if you haven't explored many different types of video games , you might find this game very interesting ! to sum it up : The story gets a 6/10 from me, but I'd give the other aspects a 9 or 10 out of 10.. It was not a game that I was drawn into. Although it was fun with its gameplay, I constantly felt that it was lacking in terms of story and immersion. The combat mechanics were different but simple, not diverse. Although there was a variety of weapons, I would have preferred the addition of mechanics that could diversify our stealth in a game that required above-average stealth. Because of this lack, I preferred to go through the levels with a bang instead of hiding. Other than this aspect, the game is definitely a game that can be bought and played, not bad. By the way, this game is very hard to combat dramatically :). boring story, boring gameplay, horrible ending, horrible optimization, good combat, good stealth. Lot of bugs, especially annoying when saving and loading guards are in different places... Also 90% of skills is useless when going through ""clean"" path (no killing, low chaos).. Great game. The only step down from the first one is the story. The first Dishonored had such a great story and characters. The story fir this game is bland by comparison. If you haven't played this game low chaos then you really haven't played this game.. The sequel to the much beloved Dishonored, brings back everything people liked about the first one but bigger and better. The story follows a similar path but the gameplay is much more refined, with more open levels and more approaches to every goal, this game is very replayable. Especially with the dual protagonists, making you go back and play it through again but with different powers.. It is a Masterpiece, highly recommend, you have meaningful choices, great stealth game with intelligent enemies.. Dishonored 2… now here is a game that never should have been made. One that was trying to make quick and easy money with a name that would be recognized. This was also when every game needed a female lead so it has Empress Emily be playable, but late in the development they decided to add Corvo in as a playable option too (which is who I chose cuz why do I care about Emily?) but it’s clearly half-baked with the dialogue clearly signifying that you’re meant to play as Emily while at the same time the lines are hardly even changed between the two. There is so much poor retconning, which of course there is otherwise this game couldn’t exist. How does Corvo allow someone to get the drop on him and Emily again?? How in the world can a simple witch remove Corvo’s mark when it’s specifically stated in the first game that only the Outsider can do this? (This ensures that you start back on level 1 with powers.) And now the villain, Delilah Copperspoon, from Daud’s DLC in the first game (who was literally taken out whether you went for the good or bad ending) is related to Empress Jessamine. And there’s some really bad backstory cobbled together for the Outsider that nobody asked for. I can’t even begin to help you wrap your mind around this mess. It’s so copy-paste. Instead of rats, we have blood flies which operate in the same fashion, kill more people, more blood flies appear. The stealth and combat are just as bad in this as they were in the first one, if not worse. In the first level, the stealth was so bonkers that I ended up just bolting down the street and the AI had no idea to do with this strategy. The AI was just all around bad, shooting their own guys and presumably seeing me where I was nowhere near and attacking that spot. The power upgrades are just stripped out of the Daud DLC from the first game. Suddenly Corvo has powers he never did in the first one. Remember how the Outsider gives the Mark to particular people to see what they do with their abilities which are specially tailored for them? Not anymore. The Outsider’s voice actor has also changed and man the new guy is awful! He also no longer makes commentary on your actions throughout the game because at the end of the day, they don’t really matter. The final boss battle just has you screaming to be done with the game. And when you are done, you wonder why you put yourself through such a pathetic ordeal instead of playing something good. Do not play this game. I didn’t think the first game was all that good, I felt that it dropped the ball on many of its aspects but this ‘sequel’ is just disgusting in how obvious it is as a cash-grab. Save yourself and find something else to play.. Dishonored 2 is a worthy sequel to the first game, nothing more to say if you already played the first one.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Solid game. Story is pretty weak and prefer a silent protagonist. Improves on gameplay and stealth, but mission design isnt as good as the first.. Great game, the stealth and combat is awesome. The powers are realy fun to use and you create interesting combos the with other abilities or other pieces of your gear. 10/10. Greatly improved everything from the first game. The combat, stealth, story, music, everything is amazing. I highly recommend.. BIG dissapointment. Dishonored 1 is one of my favourites games ever, but this, as opposite to that masterpiece, has no soul. Story has the same structure as the first one: feels like a copypaste. Gameplay is a copypaste too, wich is not bad... But the world just doesnt feel with the same charisma. Corvo's voice is SO ANNOYING, It was a very bad decision to give him a voice. And there are women EVERYWHERE. Dangerous thieves? Women. Dangerous pirates? Women. elite guards? Women (but not a single woman is a common guard). Powerful bank owner? A woman. Crown killer? A woman who didnt knew what she was doing, of course. How could this happen in a 2016 game? Well, Anita Sarkeesian IS the answer. Very dissapointed.. Dishonored 2 is fantastic, definitely a 10/10! The level of detail in the world and story-building is just incredible. Karnaca feels so alive and real, every corner has something to discover. The atmosphere is perfect, blending spooky vibes with breathtaking beauty. And the gameplay? It's insanely fun! You can go all-out action or sneak around like a shadow, and both ways are super satisfying. Every choice you make changes the game, so it's always fresh. If you love games with great stories, good gameplay and incredible atmosphere, you must play Dishonored 2!. The game is very boring, the powers can't be used always; the stealth is sick and not entertaining, i don't understand how people like this game. And another big problem is that for ps5 it's only 30 fps and only english language. If u want buy this game only with sale.. Great game that had a slightly worse story than the original but had far better mechanics and world building. The best game I've ever played.. Fixed the issues of the original Dishonored, and brings it all more so to life.. I really like Dishonored games. And this part improves everything - it adds replayability, different styles of advancing, and an even better plot. The locations are atmospheric and you can achieve your goals in the tone of ways. it's a bit too long and it's still dishonored AND fun I like that you can choose between two characters with different abilities. An excellent immersive sim with some seriously ingenious level design and some interesting powers. Ultimately not as good as its predecessor.. Another visually pleasing stealth-based FPS set in a steampunk world of aristocratic bounders and assassins. It's a little too stealth-heavy for my liking and melee combat never works in first person but the interesting, evolving story and nice graphics will keep you playing to see what comes next.. Dishonored 2 is a perfect sequel, improving on it's predecessor in almost every way. The replayability is even more front and center and the gameplay mechanics have been substantially improved. Even the characters are made more interesting and fleshed out.. Dishonored 2 is a masterclass in immersive gaming. With its expertly crafted world-building, intricate plot, and dynamic gameplay, it's a must-play for fans of the stealth-action genre. The game's art direction and sound design are truly exceptional, and the attention to detail in every aspect of the game is evident from start to finish. What really sets Dishonored 2 apart, however, is its player choice system. The ability to choose your character, each with their own unique set of abilities, and to approach every mission in multiple ways, means that the replay value of the game is through the roof. Every decision you make has consequences, and the game's many possible outcomes will have you hooked from beginning to end. Whether you prefer to play as the deadly assassin Emily or the masterful Corvo, Dishonored 2 is a game that will keep you engaged and immersed for hours on end. Its combination of stealth, action, and player choice make it a standout title in the genre, and a must-play for anyone who appreciates expertly crafted storytelling and dynamic gameplay. Overall, Dishonored 2 is a masterpiece ****, and a worthy addition to any gamer's collection.. Played it firs time in 2023! Amazing game, much better than Deathloop (still very good game)... so many good moments and game mechanics!. Fantastic video game! Super fun as exciting and, above all, fascinating. Kudos to the developers for hunting this pearl in an increasingly barren market. Well done! P.S. it works great. Considering that ""gameplay masterpiece"" Dishonored was, expectations about Dishonored 2 were high, as were, probably, fears that it might have been not living up to those expectations. I'd say it went well and Arkane did not disappoint. Dishonored 2 continues from the world created by the first Dishonored but takes us 15 years later in the city of Karnaca (mostly), nation of Serkonos, part of the Empire of the Isles construct. Karnaca has a fascinating southern European vibe. Playing as Corvo Attano means reliving the thrills and mood of the first game, but I think the plot is deeper and truer playing as Emily Kaldwin, dethroned empress because of witch Delilah's coup d'état, who, outside her throne, among the streets, will discover herself and achieve to inwardly grow and dominate her dimension, taking back what is hers. That said, I still think Dunwall and the first Dishonored's plot and mood have a special place in my heart. Dishonored 2 is mostly an iteration of the same brilliant gameplay from the first game. Similar verticality, similar combat, similar approach possibilities. You can play, as said, both as Corvo Attano and as Emily Kaldwin: there are no changes in physical abilities but in the powers they get from the god-like man, The Outsider. Corvo retains many of his powers from the previous game while Emily's powers are fun novelties, like ""Domino"" and ""Shadow Walk"". Bone Charms to enhance passive attributes and Runes to enhance powers return but with a change: they can be crafted. By sacrificing Bone Charms it's possible to extract passive attribute enhancements and get Raw Whalebone(s) to craft new personalized Bone Charms. The more complex a personalized Bone Charm is, the more passive attribute enhancements it incorporates but the more risk of corruption increases. Crafting Runes is similar but more expensive in Raw Whalebone and may be less convenient. In combat, Dishonored 2 also introduces non-lethal combat moves. Again, the stealth approach, with few deaths (Low Chaos), is encouraged but to explore all of Dishonored 2's approaches, High Chaos is required, which means many dead and being detected, which in turn, again, affects the ending of the game because the more corpses, the more proliferation of bloodflies (Serkonos' plague). Level design is generally great and some levels stand out, as the always mutating, labyrinthian and fascinating Clockwork Mansion, or Stilton Manor with time travel using the Timepiece artifact; both allow cool gameplay things to be done. In stealth, darkness still offers shelter only at a certain distance and I still find this gameplay approach to be mostly bad. I think Clockwork Soldiers are unbalanced as it's not fair they see even from behind. Also, optional or not, I think a run without powers (which I did) it's impossible to be done wholly stealthily and further refined game design would have fixed this issue. I would say enemy AI still has some issues but got better. Dishonored 2 is, of course, graphically nicer than the first game, but to tell the truth it's simply not as bad as the first at the time of its release was, quite the contrary. Again, its art style impacted but positively this time. The audio and music component of the game is of great quality. Dishonored 2 is a sequel that lived up to expectations, at least for me. If I had to choose, I would probably choose the first Dishonored, because that's where raw feelings are. But Dishonored 2 it's brilliant, deep, and intriguing, even if not without flaws. A video game that Dishonored fans will love.. When they say you can play your own way they meant it. I cannot stop playing this game and always go back to it. You can play as either Corvo or Emily and both have their own supernatural abilities so playing both is refreshing. The graphics are perfect and fit in with the style of the game. No performance issues on PS4 and it runs extremely well. If I could give this game a higher score I would. I leave you with my favorite quote from the game. Shall we gather for whisky and cigars tonight?. A good game, though it does not live up to its predecessor. Retains the combat, graphics, and player-driven choices, but doesn't hold onto the fun and excitement of the first game. Solid sequel still for those looking for more Dishonored.. i didn't think anything could match up to what the first one did for me but god dammit Bethesda did it and they made even MORE fun to play. i do find some aspects of this game lacking but it makes up for it in the gameplay mechanics and the expansion of the lore and world. yet again this and the first will be one of my favorite games of all time.. Good game with good playability. Choose Corvo or Emily is good to explore different options of play, the only thing that I don't like is the design of the maps. If you liked dishonored 1, you will love 2. Thats all I have to say you mofos.. Had to turn stealth to easy because all guards are like Pain from Naruto, they all share the same vision. If one sees you, everyone sees. You cant return to stealth, enemies see you through walls and have vampiric audition.. Similar like the first one for me. Also nice, beautiful visuals,cities,characters. The gameplay is fluid and the story is interesting.. Some of the worst writing I've ever seen in a videogame, and that's saying something. The cutscenes are absolutely unbearable, and skipping through them just leaves a clunky, mediocre stealth action game that has way, way too high an opinion of itself. Strong recommendation to avoid.. Overall solid game. It's a series I will hope to see more of if anything. I did feel like some things were kind of annoying to do in regards of gameplay, but that's personal preference. Hopefully more fluidity and different choices of abilities in the next one? I know DOTO came out and I have yet to try that, but we'll see.. It feels more like a continuation of Dishonoured 1 rather than a fully new title in itself, with most elements carried over as is. This time the setting is post-rat plague, but the city is no less rotten. This time as advertised you can play as either Corvo or his now-adult daughter Emily Kauldwin. The other will be locked in stone for most of the gameplay so the decision is permanent unless you start a new game. Emily also has some different powers than Corvo and cannot possess animals and humans. “Blink” becomes “Far reach” though they are basically the same. As with the first game you have the same choose your playstyle and you will be rated for how violent/peaceful (chaos level) your actions were which affects how the world looks. No rat hazard (usually) this time, instead the buildings are infested with bloodfly nests, The red honeycomb-like structures are swarmed with the flies and you can choose to destroy the nests and risk attack of the bloodflies or slowly sneak past. You get money from a gem from the nests so there is a benefit to the former. Bone charms and runes are also often located in the same area if you want to take the risk. Some particularly interesting levels in this game are the clockwork mansion full of shifting walls and rooms, stairs, and tables that change at the pull of a lever or press of a button, and you can sneak around the walls and back ways ‘like a rat’ and see how it works (it’s also part of the intended route). Beware the clockwork soldiers however, powerful robots who can look both in front and behind but will not distinguish between enemy and ally (guards) when the head is destroyed. There is also the time travel piece that allows you to instantly warp between the present, a crumbling mostly abandoned mansion, and the past when it was a place of luxury, and see what happened and perhaps change history. You lose most of your powers on this level so have to rely on time travel to dodge around enemies, especially if going for low chaos. I played it (mostly) twice so I think it’s good. The levels above make it particularly unique, the time travel one especially.. It's a fun sequel to its predecessor, for sure. My main qualm is that it didn't nail the vibe of a plague ridden run down city like the first game did.. ---{ Graphics }--- ☐ You forget what reality is Beautiful ☐ Good ☐ Decent ☐ Bad ☐ Don‘t look too long at it ☐ MS-DOS ---{ Gameplay }--- Very good ☐ Good ☐ It's just gameplay ☐ Mehh ☐ Watch paint dry instead ☐ Just don't ---{ Story }--- ☐ No Story ☐ Some lore Average ☐ Good ☐ Lovely ☐ It'll replace your life ---{ Game Time }--- ☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee ☐ Short Average ☐ Long ☐ To infinity and beyond ---{ Price }--- ☐ It's free!

Arkane Studios is truly good game devepoler.. Fantastic and gorgeous game that deserves your attention! Definitely give it a try!. This game is memorable and absolutely dripping in atmosphere. It's super fun to play, the visuals and style are great, and Emily is a fantastic protagonist. The story is heart-wrenching and has really stuck with me since playing. There are some great mechanics and memorable scenes, and the Outsider in this game really stuck out to me as being a great, enigmatic character who ties the whole world together in a very fascinating way.. What a game! One of the best level designs ever! Some missions are just mind blowing!. Excellent game, solid story and combat. I loved the original game but I think this one is a bit better.. A pretty good game when you get into it. It's got some quirks that set it apart from the first game which, personally, make it feel a little less tight mechanically than the first, but the levels are much, much more sprawling and insanely densely packed with things to do and explore. The first game is still better in my opinion, but Dishonored 2 brings so may new things to the table that for the most part work that it's hard to hate it. The main problem I have with the game is the comparative looseness compared to the first game in mechanics. Enemies sometime seem to be able to spot you from lightyears away and when you're directly above them, somehow, and some ways you get caught can often feel unfair and not at all the fault of the player. Further there are several bugs that didn't exist in the first game, such as Emily's Far Reach instant killing you for no reason, and an arc pylon that didn't shut off even though I had removed its power source entirely leading to another instant death. It was due to these that I despised the game at first, putting it down for three years until a repeat playthrough of the first game and its DLC rekindled an interest in giving it another go. The finicky nature of the game compared to the first one set me off just as much as it had before, and by the third mission, the one I'd clocked out on the first time, I was still having an experience that ranged from lukewarm to terrible. After that, however, I slowly began to get a feel for how the game worked different from the first, and outside a few weird hiccups I began to really sink into it, until by the end I was absolutely hooked. Took a bit for me to come around to it, but if you just stick with it, chances are you'll fall for it just as hard as the first one. I'll still hold the first game as superior in my heart, but I'm planning on putting in multiple playthroughs of its sequel just the same.. One of the most underrated games I've ever played. really good game, really good sequel to the amazing first game.. Had a lot of fun, but its a bit bugged and bad optimised in 2021. What a shame.. Uninteresting story and characters that fall flat compared to the first game, two characters with the same story but different (and cringe) dialogue that often breaks the immersion of you being in a STEALTH, dark and broody game. Copy-paste powers and some weird glitches (walking into a peaceful NPC killed him by throwing him to against a window at 1000km/h which alerted everyone around). The only thing it has going for it is some very interesting level design like the shapeshifting house, and it's still a Dishonored game, just a more low effort one. Bullcrap DLC though, who cares about that character anyway.. Overall a good game but less inspired and with a weak and predictable story compared to Dishonored 1. The first half is excellent, then it becomes blunt and even boring at times, I had to push myself to finish the last two missions and I ended up with a lot of unused runes. The endings are nothing special and seems to have been rushed just to give a closure to the story.. take it from 13 year old the game is fantastic but i think in the mid game the game start to feel boring , if y wait a bit it come back up but the boring stage of the game is like 3 hours so try to get used to it. Great story and playthrough overall. You have different options in terms of completing objectives. In my case, I am more of an aggressive type causing alot of chaos in the game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The aim acceleration and native input delay (on the PS4 version - NOT the PC version, which is not what you should be basing your reviews on for this entry) make this a gigantic chore to play. If you're used to garbage controls, then I guess it's fine, but for those who are expecting a smooth controlling experience, you might as well play this on PC or go find another game. Overall story was decent and a good continuation of the previous game. The experience is just marred by terrible controls and the awful aforementioned aim acceleration.. **Please note this review is for the PS4 version only, i have heard of these same issues on xbox but supposedly this is not the case on PC but idk bc no gaming PC. sadly.* decided to pick the bundle edition with death of the outsider, never played the series but had long admired it on youtube. love the art style, game play looks excellent, narrative and world are fascinating. unfortunately i guess the devs have decided to troll console users or something? bc my god this game plays like utter **** on ps4 pro (consoles in general from what i read). its not *technically* unplayable but its def unplayable for me bc after several hours of slogging thru this **** im done with it. to start with the FOV is insane, its like looking down a low power telescope and theres no way to change it. its so zoomed in you routinely get hit offscreen by enemies that took two steps and went from right in front of you to off screen. it also makes looting/looking for things a pain. right stick/camera movement is just awful - aiming it literally nigh impossible due to some weird camera acceleration that seems to happens when you aim and if you turn sensitivity down youre slow as hell anytime you need to turn. who thought this was a good idea? did they just not test any of this before release? if it was a PC game first (idk if this is the case) fine, just adjust it so it functions on consoles. i really dont understand these decisions. the game is not exceptionally difficult, but considering its a 1st person game, these issues just make it frustrating and completely unenjoyable to play, to the point where im done even trying to adapt to it now. which is a shame bc there is a really great game here... its just totally unsalvagable imo, unless they fix these issues (and considering im writing this in 2021 i doubt thatll happen) got it for $8, i wouldnt have downloaded and played it if you PAID me $8 knowing what i know now.. This game is a perfect stealth action,where you can pick your style of play. Plus,guide- Corvo is better for stealth,and Emily is better for high haos. And yeas,you must play it. Just plain boring. Seems like it would be good with all the moves and magic. But the moment to moment gamplay is dull. Main character is a hugh let down and bland ugly crone type that is about as relatable and likeable. Good story and it did win best adventure game emily was my favorite character although I didn't finish it. This game is great, the story was interesting and the gameplay is pretty good. While the clockwork mansion was quite a chore, and the game can go a little overboard with it's security areas, the gameplay overall was quite great. I loved being able to quickly maneuver, and the stealth felt quite satisfying. Great game.. Just love everything about the franchise. Beautiful world and character design. The story caught me like the first one. Absolute 10/10. A great sequel that has the strengths of Dishonored and improves on it. It is set 15 years after the events of the prequel. Corvo has aged but is far away from retiring. He trained his daughter Empress Emily Kaldwin well in the skills of stealth, infiltration, fighting and assassination as he knows the time will come when her enemies will make their moves. After a coup by Delilah Copperson it is your decision to chose either Corvo or Emily to be the playable character. Dishonored 2 continued were the prequel stopped as best stealth game in years. The setting is dark and matured. It has also a better story than the prequel. It is full of reveals, plots, twists and the old and new characters never fail to deliver. Fans / players of the prequel know Delilah Copperson and will be puzzled how this could be happened as she should be neutralized (Handled in DLC for Dishonored). It is a tough and intense ride to defeat the traitors. The returning old characters that I wont spoil work well. They have also developed during the years that have past and have relatable personalities / motives. For the new ones I think Kirin Jindosh, Aramis Stilton and the Duke of Serkanos (he counts twice ;-) are great additions to the cast and lore. As in the prequel based on your approach / decisions it gets even darker /more hopeless later on. If you kill many guards in one level then the next level will be guarded heavier with more guards (There are also other changes which I won't spoil). It is possible to solve the game without killing anyone or ever get detected. Lets start with the abilities. Again the Outsider a being who is existing between realms and worshiped by some as god and seen by others as evil pagan demon gives you a choice to receive his blessing in form of supernatural abilities (and a mark). You can of cause refuse but I think the abilities are too fun and awesome to avoid. Both Corvo and Emily have unique abilities so you can replay the game with the other one for a different experience. Because Corvos abilities are close to his in Dishonored 1 I favored Emily. The variety is great as there are abilities for stealth, manipulation and fighting. You can learn or upgrade your abilities during the game after reaching special locations. They improve the levels / environments. Like in the prequel the variety in the levels is remarkable. Most times there are multiple ways or approaches for a task. When I replayed a level I often find alternative ways or set things in motion that even change the outcomes. Here in this games are 2 masterpieces with Jindosh mansion he specially created as challenge for intruders or Stiltons mansion with 4th dimensional gameplay (Keep thinking hard what is possible as you can make mayor changes here if you grasp the possibilities correctly). There are some sidequests added to the game atop on collecting valuables, charms (give small bonuses), blueprints, lore and ability points. This variety and the multiple approaches give a lot of replay value. The graphics look great as they have a special art style for the world and characters. I liked that style as it enhances the game. Overall this is a great game that surpasses its predecessor. There is so much to explore, abilities to test / use and different paths to take. An easy recommendation for lovers of stealth games.. One of the most underrated games. The level design and character abilities just incorporate perfectly. There’re always multiple solutions to the same task. And the art style is so elegant and beautiful. I really hope people don’t get turn away by its seemingly less colourful visual effects. It’ll be great if Arkane studio can make a sequel.... This game can be played one of two ways: the way the developers want you to play, and the way that’s fun. The strath gameplay is the intended way, but it’s completely frustrating, broken and stupid. The rules are unclear and never explained properly and the core gameplay seems to be save scumming. Why design a video game in a way that the best advice you can give players is “save often”? The sad part is, there is a fun game in here, but if you play it like an action adventure romp, the game keeps telling you it’s wrong and you should feel bad. Screw this game - video games are meant to be fun, not pointlessly frustrating and annoying.. this game is including so many types of gameplay and such a beatiful steampunk ambiance. i am very excited while playing. Chapter Desings, The story (not the best thing but very good), cool mechanics and satisfying combat. This game was the best thing i had ever played. Great game... Worth every single penny..... Had a great time with this game. Story 10/10.. graphics 10/10. Gameplay 10/10. First off, the game is great, and I do recommend it. The gameplay is really fun, with some awesome quality of life improvements after Dishonored 1 and Death of the Outsider, like the quick save and quick load buttons. They did the level design well in general—although most of my complaints concern the game’s design, the levels are still really fun to wander around, and tracking down enemies and slowly taking them down one by one is a blast as you slowly unlock more areas you can safely explore. The art is the same great art from before, and the music was a treat. The sound design in general in all the Dishonored games is top shelf. There is a LOT of lore, so if you’re a completionist and you know you can’t find a scrap of paper in a game without reading it or you feel like you’re not getting ‘the full experience’, this g","the story gets a 6/10 from me, but i'd give the other aspects a 9 or 10 out of 10 . the combat mechanics were different but simple, not diverse . the only step down from the first one is the story ."
573.JSRF: Jet Set Radio Future,"A big step down from its predecessor. JSRF is too confident on its deficient controls, and it's poor level design makes it a real pain playing many of it's levels. Graffiti system has been simplified and that's welcome, but everything else on the game, even character models looks and feels worse than JSR.. This game looks and plays great even after 22 years to me a new player to this whole franchise it definitely has that weird charm to it that definitely makes me want to come back to it the grinding and tricks are very satisfying to do I just love this game!. The style, the music, the gameplay. This game took everything good about the original and improved upon it in ways kid me and adult me appreciate very very much. Also got a sneaky F-bomb in the soundtrack which always got a laugh out of me as a kid. The only negative about this game is that it's stuck on the OG Xbox with no backwards compatibility support or ports.. The music alone in this game is awesome! And it goes perfectly with nature of the games premise. This is a timeless gem that Sega hopefully will bring back.. Great looking cel shaded graphics and a cult soundtrack marks JSRF from the crowd in this graffiti-based rollerblading game. Cynics could point out it's just a dumbed-down version of Tony Hawk with self-consciously ""cool"" window dressing, but it is fun and worth it for the audio-visuals alone.. An anime fan paradise that glorifies the post-war japanese society and acts of public vandalism. A playing software with such a botched starting concept that is only rivaled by its horrid execution. Truly the worst of its generation.. Aesthetics, soundtrack, artstyle, animations, and all of it culminates into a beautifully stylish experience with better controls than the original jsr. This game is amazing, there are no analogues and I think there will not be! Everything is perfect in the game, from the stunning character design and locations to the music! I really miss the JSR series, SEGA will release an HD remaster!. This game is insanely fun and addicting. The camera totally blows, the Japannese atmosphere is awesome. This game is better 100% than its first game (Jet Grind Radio). I mean, c'mon sega you should make another sequel for this amazing game.. An uneven game. It does bring interesting art and gameplay concept, but often fails to execute. Some parts of it - like the hyped Death Ball (whole chapter 5) - are just laughable. You get ahead and you win. You repeat that three times and that's it. Makes me really wonder if anyone playtested this game. Soundtrack has some cool tunes, some meh tunes, and that one absolutely obnoxious track with some girl screaming off tune to a crappy beat (chapters 2 and 4), it made me mute the TV every time it started playing. The fights with Police were braindead, the Tag races... I mean, you can just wait in one spot and spray them as they pass by, and you'll still win. There's so much wrong with this game. And the extreme repetitiveness of it (enter a level, spray all tags, do a race or fight Police, rinse repeat) really makes you bored at times. But at the same time, the actual races (not the ones you're supposed to spray someone's back) are fun, and there's plenty of cool ""platforming"" in this game that makes you entertained. There is a lot of aspects to this game that are a nod to the ""collectathons"" of N64 times - there's a ton of things to explore for, unlock or beat. It's probably THE challenge of the game, because the storyline is just braindead easy, save some hard to find tags or difficult jumps. The difficulty is also very uneven, ie. in the final boss fight you have to do a series of jumps with perfect precision (hard as hell) and then fight one of the easiest bosses in video game history. Okay? I guess it's a love/hate kind of a title. You either love it, or you don't. I certainly didn't. It's not a bad game, but it's not a good game either. Which leaves it at 5/10.. A true classic that will never be forgotten. It is a futuristic retelling of the original Jet Set Radio on the Dreamcast, with major differences in the graffiti system, graphics, and even characters. If you liked the first game, open world games, futuristic games, or any other kind of game in general, you will love this one.. A part of my childhood,but I replayed at 2020,the game duration is around 18-24 hrs of history and do other stuff +30 hrs. Is a unique game,fun, easy difficulty if you master the mechanics. The bads: The bosses feels little annoying,and the map design not my favorite. But in a general view the game is very fun, awesome scenarios, art design and good animation. I recommend it a true jewel of OG Xbox,and you can create your own graffiti designs !!. Jet set radio future is one of the best games to play on the original XBOX. The fun game play and incredible music from Hideki Naganuma is something you should experience yourself.. Might not be a very popular game, but it’s actually very good! However, I do prefer the original, but this is still fun to play!. It's soon coming up to 20 years since this game was released (well, in 3 years, which in the scheme of things is pretty soon). There hasn't been a year where I haven't done at least one playthrough of this game. The style, the fluid skating (days of my life spent trying to replicate this myself to no avail), the music, the characters, the level design; all phenomenal. This game would be my bucket island game, I could never tire of this. Emulation of the game is progressing, but I'd love an official port of this to PC and modern consoles (or at least just PC).. The definition of a hidden gem. The game's art style is great. The controls are a bit dated, but it still works very well. And the soundtrack... *STARTS HUMMING CONCEPT OF LOVE*. looking back on a ""not quite sequel"" of the original dreamcast powerhouse jet grind radio, this game honesty deserves better. being a huge jet set radio fan, i was actually shocked to realize i didnt hear about this jet set radio title until 6 months ago. it is the forgotten one as i would say. but nonetheless, it is a true XBOX game. This is game is amazing if you just want to have some fun and chill for a bit.. In the sequel, many inconveniences and problems were eliminated and even playing became much more convenient and pleasant. There were also many other problems such as an inconvenient camera, confusing locations and the lack of a mini map. But in general, the sequel in my opinion came out much better than the original of this game and if you have Xbox then you have to play this game.. Fun, Unique, & Colorful. One of the most original and unique games ive played on the OG Xbox. The music is just as good and helps make the game what it is in my opinion.. Hey. My 14 year old Xbox steamed up and died on me about a week ago while playing this so I came here to reminiscence about how I'm going to miss it. Nah I'm just kidding. This game was something else, and way ahead of it's time! There was just really only one thing I had trouble with, and it'd been the controls. I literally couldn't stop dying in the **** District, Sky Dinosaurian Square, and Dogenzaka Hill with how frustrating getting off of rails and trying to turn away from edges. But it was still fun though you know? To hear DJ Professor K laugh in my face a million times? Oh yeah. Anyway, time to get an Xbox 360 because I'm ready to go get ALL of my 100 graffiti souls back from those street challenges.... This game is so awesome. Many areas and not repetitive at all, you never get tired of it. Love the sound track too, it was away ahead of it's time. Wishing for a remake from SEGA.. I originally played this game for the first time when i was 6. Every month, my dad used to buy a xbox game disc and then, one day i played JSRF demo. As a child i was fascinated by the gameplay, but i lost the disc and after my original xbox broke, i wasn't able to play it for a long time. Then i bought a X360 and two months ago, during a comicon, i found an original copy of this game in sale. I bought it immediately and i was astonished (for the second time, with the same game, that's rare) by the freshness and innovation brought by the gameplay. Even today, in 2015, i simply can't find a game similar to JSRF (except the original jet grind radio), it was a milestone for trick/platform games, and WHAT A MILESTONE! Graphics were extraordinary for the time and are quite good today, soundtrack is simply amazing and the levels are beautifully designed, with many shortcuts and secret areas. I know many of you couldn't give the game more than 5 minutes, and i'm really sorry for that. But i honestly think that skating in dogenzaka hill with ""I love love you"" playing in background is an amazing experience that you need to do at least once in your life.. Sega hit a home run with this one. Innovative, and for reasons I can't seem to figure out, it never got noticed by the majority of gamers. The only true flaw it sometimes gets repetitive, but the soundtrack makes up for that.. Growing up as a poor child with only an Xbox as a Christmas present, I didn't possess a large collection of remarkable games that I could always go back to. JSRF bucks this trend for me as it still stands as a title that oozes style rather than creativity. Now you may think that would turn it on its own head losing any sort of original concept, but the style and art design of this game is supremely sublime, one of the best in gaming. The gameplay blends a roller skating mechanism that has a very competent system of tricks and bells that's primarily saved by the flashy art style. And the graffiti aspect is limited to only one trigger, but is fun enough to warrant your attention. And the soundtrack is just....listen to it. It's a mix of Japanese Pop and some artists that really compliment the neo-Tokyo totalitarian soul graffiti skater game, and I love it.. I grew up with this game. The music, story, and graphics are steller. And the music is great. I recommend this game to everyone though it isn't a game for everyone. Hello Isle Ten...... An awesome game! The character designs, and graphics in general, are amazing, the music isn't what I would listen to on a regular basis, but it is quite fitting for the game and not obnoxious, the gameplay is fun, and the different places to explore are interesting. The only really bothersome thing is that, these characters seem so fun and cool, so I am wondering why they didn't put in more effort into developing their back stories, or giving them much dialogue at all. So, plot wise, it is the littlest bit lacking, but if overall story line isn't what you are looking for, at least in the character development department, this game is definitely something you should check out.. This game absolutely bleeds style, from it's amazing and beautiful cel-shaded graphics to it's hilarious over the top characters, to its awesome soundtrack. It's gameplay is fun, like some sort of weird mix between a showoff sports game, (eg snowboarding) a racing game, and a adventure game. All of the characters look and feel very different from each other. The story is so so but one character, aptly named DJ Professor K deserves special mention, he basically serves as a hilarious narrator, I laughed out loud several times at his awesome one liners. This game is more open worldy than it's predecessor, and it works well. It's got a lot of challenge later on especially if you want to unlock the secret characters. All in all a fantastic experience.. It's quite telling when reviews are spread out so much- either extremely positive or extremely negative. Something to note though, is that the people who voted it low mostly didn't give the game more than a few minutes. Out of the critics, eg people who actually have (or at least, are expected to), there's not a single negative review. This game is one of the most outstanding and unique achievements of all time. It wont be for everybody, and is flawed in some aspects. Fortunately the outstanding parts overshadow the shortcomings parts in a big way- and for a game that took outrageous risks (the soundtrack brings together some of the weirdest and unappealing tracks ever and makes them into something absolutely incredible) pretty much all of it pays off. Sure, the level design can be detrimental to the fun factor, by trying to inject difficulty, and it gets a little lengthy if you don't take a decent break between sessions. But playing this through for the second time (third if you count the DC version) now, and it still holds up fantastically. Graphics, characters, style, gameplay... 10 years after release, and it still feels fresher than fresh.. Incredibly fun. A great sequel, to one of the most fun Dreamcast games. Few games capture the style and flare this game portrayed. Music, Graphics and fun were all there. A great game by all accounts.","jsr is too confident on its deficient controls, and it's poor level design makes it a real pain playing many of it's levels . this game looks and plays great even after 22 years to me a new player to this whole franchise it definitely has that weird charm to it ."
574.Ratchet & Clank,"Awkward gun play with a few bad levels in a game with great a sound track & level designs.. When I think of the original Ratchet & Clank, it’s not just a video game—it’s an experience that defined my childhood and shaped who I am as a gamer today. Released in 2002 by Insomniac Games, this title wasn’t just groundbreaking for its time; it remains a cornerstone in the action-platformer genre. Graphics and Design: A Visual Spectacle for Its Time For a PlayStation 2 game, Ratchet & Clank was visually stunning. The worlds were vibrant, full of life, and packed with details that immersed you in every planet you visited. Each level had its own unique personality, from bustling futuristic cities to desolate landscapes. While modern games have surpassed its technical capabilities, the charm of its art style remains timeless. Gameplay: Endless Fun Gameplay was the game's strongest suit. The perfect balance between platforming, combat, and exploration made it incredibly engaging. The arsenal of weapons and gadgets was innovative and diverse—something that quickly became the franchise’s trademark. The first time you used the Glove of Doom or the **** Cannon, you realized this game was something special. Although the controls could feel slightly rigid compared to later titles, they were more than adequate for the time. Characters and Story: An Iconic Duo Ratchet and Clank, the dynamic duo, were a perfect match. The evolution of their relationship throughout the game was one of its most memorable aspects. Ratchet started as a sarcastic and somewhat selfish mechanic, while Clank was the serious, mission-focused robot. Together, they not only saved the galaxy but also became one of the most beloved teams in gaming. Meanwhile, villains like Chairman Drek added humor and charisma to the narrative. Replayability and Challenges For completionists, Ratchet & Clank provided a real challenge. Achieving 100% or earning a platinum trophy required countless hours of dedication, replaying levels, upgrading weapons, and exploring every nook and cranny. While this isn’t my personal focus, it’s a rewarding experience for fans who enjoy it. Additionally, the glitches and secrets, like the famous infinite bolt trick, added an extra layer of fun. Innovation and Legacy This title wasn’t just “great for its time”; it laid the foundation for a franchise that has continued to evolve and improve with each entry. Back in 2002, Ratchet & Clank was groundbreaking in its blend of genres, humor, and design. It wasn’t just a game—it was a gateway to worlds that still captivate gamers to this day. Conclusion Ratchet & Clank is far more than just a game; it’s a masterpiece. For those of us who played it as kids, it represents an essential part of our gaming history. Its innovation, visuals, characters, and gameplay make it a timeless classic. A perfect 10 for a gem that, over 20 years later, remains unforgettable.. A Masterpiece. Gameplay 10/10 (level design, weapons, combat, gadgets, paths, bonus areas, arenas, races, grindrails, spaceship combat, bosses, replayability, enemy diversity, etc.) Presentation, Mood and Character 11/10 (Graphics, soundtrack, lines, jokes, etc.) Story 10/10 (Plot, Heroes Villains, NPCs, character development, etc.). Everything about this game is great. It’s an amazing platform game that anyone can play. You have a lots of weapons to choose from, three backpack versions of Clank, spectacular level design, boss fights are great, balanced difficulty and more! The only thing I didn’t like, is that when you’re switching weapons the time doesn’t pause. I’ve died so many times because of this. So if you have a PS2 I highly recommend it. 9/10. An innovative 3D action platformer. This first ""Ratchet"" laid the foundation for future entries to build upon. While not the best game in the series, R&C is still great fun. The wacky weapons and inventive tools help make it an enjoyable ride. As you explore each planet, you'll uncover secrets, solve puzzles and engage in explosive combat. Overall, fans of space adventure movies will love this. I would rate it with an 8.7 out of 10.. It was a good game for its year. Level design is not bad. Funny characters. Various weapons and tools. Various game dynamics. Generally, it is a linear game. The formula is the same in most sections. I didn't like the final boss, it took too long, I got bored. And I didn't have an electric gun. I need to collect bolts again, I don't want that either. But overall I enjoyed it.. Certified hood classic. The game has a great ost for every planet, The platforming is pretty good, and the story is also very good, also it has some pretty funny dark humore. buy it or else. Rachet & Clank is so close to being something really awesome, but it just never quite makes it there. Everything is almost with it, and while it’s a decent platformer in its own right, the game itself needs a lot of fixes with combat and atmosphere to make it really stand out. Thankfully this is only the start of a series and not what the series has become, and if this is its starting point, I’m sure it will be good.. This game changed the platforming genre for ever. One of the most fun and unique game worlds of all time even if the controls didn’t aged very well.. very great start to an amazing series. the lack of strafing is not that annoying, however ratchet does control a little bit sluggishly. towards the end of the game, its more of a hide and snipe rather than run and gun. but levels, characters, weapons are all pretty darn good. a lot of weapons are kinda useless though, whilst others arent. the time to kill is fantastic, most enemies die after 1-3 successful hits, making the weapons feel powerful throughout the majority of the game. ratchet has a great arc and is kind of edgy, but it works imo. One of the strongest original IPs on the playstation 2. Hot on the heels of spyro the dragon success insomniac nail another action platforming game. Whilst it doesn't have the indepth mechanics and replayability of later titles, Ratchet and Clank is an exceptional start to a beloved franchise.. One of the best platforming games ever. Amazing level design the best in the series in my opinion. The story is amazing I love how this game makes fun of capitalism unfortunately, they stopped doing it after the fourth game. If this game had strafing and the shooting system of the third game it would be a 10 out of 10 no question.. Ratchet and Clank is one of the best games on PlayStation 2 for good reason.. I can't say it's a 2002 game because it's way ahead of its release time, the animations are amazing even today. Ratchet & Clank is a third-person action-adventure title, with elements of platforming, shooting, role-playing games, and puzzle-solving.. This is fun gameplay for kids. I like this shooting and adventure game. good graphic at that time.. Ratchet and Clank (2002) is one of my Favorite 4, THE four Ratchet and Clank games i love the most. The lack of strafing is honestly not a problem for me, though the control are abit clunky sometimes. And Ratchet is abit slow with the wrench. Clank levels are not the best, but they are so few so its fine. And i don`t really like the Hoverboard races. Other than that, this is an excellent game! The many lush and unique planets in this game are some of my favorite levels in video game, the atmospehere is perfect and the music is just perfect, props to David Bergaud. The branching paths makes exploration feel more real and the one of characters are hillarious. Not to mention the excellent comedy. Ratchet is such a fun character. He is not some boy scout who wants to do good and be a superhero, but a street smart mechanic who really just wanna do what he wants. Clank is more of the level headed one, but is also quite naive. A fantastic game with amazing planets, excellent music, awesome weapons and a interesting story. This game is so good its Qwarktastic!. Ratings for the time period it came out Story : 8 Gameplay : 9 Graphics : 7 Fun Factor : 10 Environment interaction : 5 Sound effects : 10 Overall Immersion : 8 There's no such thing as a perfect game. Ratchet and Clank 1 on PS Vita Game completed : January 1, 2021 Playtime : 18 hrs This is the 2nd ratchet i completed the first 1 is the R&C PS4. I find this older game way better than the ps4. It has way better phasing and has more authentic experience. I find the game too difficult and tedious for a game made for younger audience. Overall it is supper fun but too difficult resulting to tedious experience. The story is more authentice and the ending is disappointingly short..

Overall it is supper fun but too difficult resulting to tedious experience. The story is more authentice and the ending is disappointingly short.. I very hated this game after I played it first time, but now I really love it. Great plot, planets, ost, humour. Yeah, it has some troubles, but cmon, it's the first game. And this game completely destroys remake and Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy. This is a great game but after playing the games that came after it feels a lite dated. I think that this would be a ten if they had strafing, weapon level up and a few other things but right now its a 7 for me.. Ratchet and Clank is undeniably a classic of the PlayStation 2 era. However Ratchet and Clank's title of PS2 classic is more out of respect for the strong foundation it laid for future Ratchet and Clank entries rather than its ability to execute on this foundation. Much of the gameplay is excruciatingly cumbersome, cutscenes are poorly placed/paced, the soundtrack feels random and often fails garner any particular sense of atmosphere. The bones of what would come to make Ratchet and Clank great is all here and with that there is a lot of fun to be found. I enjoyed my time with Ratchet and Clank in hindsight but in the moment there were many times I considered spending my time elsewhere.. this game is one of the best of my childhood i really love it reccomended for anyone who played jak and daxter. Graphics: 5/10 Soundtracks: 8/10 Gameplay: 4/10 (Could've been higher if it wasn't for the atrocious controls) Story & Characters: 8/10. This was a game, since I met the one of great series from PlayStation 2. I was played all games from series.. It’s cool seeing the beginning of the franchise but it’s clear that Insomniac Games were still figuring things out, the lack of strafe makes shooting more an annoyance then fun, the game is straight up cruel when it comes to handing out checkpoints. The story and ending is solid though.. Best Ratchet and Clank game. , The best way to play this game is to think more about it like strategic platformer game than a shooter because if you try to shoot everything then you are Gonna Get a bedtime, That is because the game is more designed for every encounter to use a certain kind of weapons to get through with the easiest , The story is also good very good spoof and makes you laugh and simplify so it's good , And I have played all the game in the future trilogy and they are all worthless compared to the original. One of the best video game soundtracks in the world. Ratchet and Clank is one of these Games that are so original, you can play them for hours and they never get boring because they offer so much different gameplay and an interesting World + Characters.. i really love this game its one of the best ratchet and clank games, amazing weapons so storyline is, one of the best ps2 and ratchet and clank games ever. Insomniac’s Ratchet and Clank is one of the best action platformer shooters that started the R&C franchise and the end result of it is stupendous.. The one that started it all. Simpler in comparison to its sequels, with a greater emphasis on platforming n puzzle solving. Weapons were great for their time, along with the array of side characters.. something brand new from insomniac This is the beginning of one of the best series on playstation, this is a must play game too. Even today I wonder how on Earth ps2 can render all this stuff in 60 fps. This game is amazing on so many levels, its crazy. Level design is brillant, there is ton of weapons here and shooting stuff is as satysfying as platforming, unlike in later entries, both are balanced very well. You might even say there is a bit of an rpg in here, with maxing your health and backtracking to places you already visited because you now have more equipment. But it never, ever feels like a chore. Its fun as hell!. Ratchet and Clank hit the shelves in late 2002, and since then has had 15 games in the last 18 years (including mobile) and even a theatrical released film. The history of Ratchet and Clank is long and storied, with extremely high highs and very, very low lows. Revisiting where it all began so long ago is a mixed bag, but a welcomed treat nonetheless. You begin on the planet Veldin, where the Lombax named Ratchet is repairing his ship when a crash off in the distance brings him together with a small robot nicknamed Clank. From there, you journey to planets all over the system, searching for Chairman Drek, who wants to create a new planet for his species called the Blarg, while also destroying innocent planets. While visiting the overrun planets, you’ll have a great time in the beautiful, vastly different landscapes each of them offer. There are plenty of planets to explore, and none ever feel rehashed in any way. From the beautiful sandy island beaches of Pokitaru and its Jowai Resort to the deathly toxic planet of Orxon, you will always find many new and unique attributes to each planet. While there are a good amount of enemy types on each planet, there is a very large overlap in the enemies used, so don’t go in expecting every planet's villains to be as interesting as the world around them. The many characters that you meat throughout your travel, however, more than make up for that. So many charming, memorable, and funny beings help you save the galaxy. Within these planets, however, lies the frustrating platforming. In general the movement, specifically the turning, felt sluggish and slow. Too often I cursed myself because while on thin, metal walkways, Small turns would send Ratchet flying in that direction more than he would on normal ground. Eaten inputs and weird camera angles quickly rose my death count to falling off the map. Sometimes I would even jump on a grind rail, and just slip right off to my death. With this comes the frustrating at times checkpoint system. Points of the game became infuriating when you would be sent back to the very beginning of the level after fighting through many sections of enemies just to die to a bad camera angle. If there is one thing Ratchet loves, it’s his weapons. Ratchet has 15 different weapons at his disposal. Some of these weapons are your typical run of the mill guns, like a machine gun and flamethrower. But what Ratchet and Clank does great is change things up. Crush robots with your very own metal fist, throw mini kamikaze robots out and watch them wreak havoc, or stand by and turn your foes into chickens. There is something for everyone out there, if you are able to be accurate. Most weapons have an auto lock system, but you need to be so close for it to work that it’s almost useless in many cases. Self aim can be helpful, but also not recommended most of the time due to having to stand still while aiming. Because of this, defeating the final boss became a chore. Sometimes the world would spawn plenty of ammo boxes to replenish in between phases, while some attempts were left with literally nothing to help, relying on the slowest, most painfully grindy boss fight imaginable. Ratchet and Clank is a great foundation that doesn’t stick the landing cleanly. Even though terribly frustrating at times, there is still so much to enjoy about it. Ratchet and Clank is a solid blend of run n gun and platforming, but the movement is much too limiting to accomplishing that consistent sense of enjoyment. 7.5/10. One of the best adventure games on PS2 although in my opinion inferior to the competition of jak 2. However, highly recommended.. 8 out of 10 - Amazing game. Scoring Scale: 1 - (AWFUL) Among the worst games ever made. The developer should be ashamed. 2 - (VERY BAD) These games are so bad they're insulting. 3 - (BAD) Just bad. Game suffers from a wealth of problems in all areas, very few redeeming qualities. 4 - (MEDIOCRE) A game that has its fair share of serious problems with a few glimmers of quality sprinkled throughout. More than anything it's forgettable. 5 - (OKAY) For every positive this game has there is just as many negatives. You may be able to find enjoyment in these games however you will likely be met with equal amounts frustration and disappointment. 6 - (GOOD) There is a decent amount of fun to be had in these games albeit with a few noticeable drawbacks. Worth checking out at some point especially if on sale. 7 - (GREAT) A game that has some flaws but all in all is a great game worth every penny of its purchase price. 8 - (AMAZING) Game of the year contender only allowing for some minor flaws. 9 - (SUPERB) One of if not the best game released that year, truly special. 10 - (NEAR PERFECT) One of the best games ever made.. Ratchet & Clank is probably one of the best games in its genre on the ps2. This creation was completed by me in 3 days, and it was undoubtedly worth it. The game is really addictive and makes you fall in love with it from the first seconds of gameplay. Insomniac Games has done a great job. Let's start with music / voice acting. The music is just great, each planet plays its own atmospheric track. You fall in love with this music and can't tear yourself away from it. You fall asleep humming some tunes, you Wake up humming tunes. The voice acting is also at a standstill, the main and secondary characters are voiced amazingly. Music / voice-over - 10/10 Gameplay. I don't have much to say here. The third-person view, like other platformers, allows you to immerse yourself in the game 100%. The game is played smoothly, without any unnecessary things. Gameplay - 10/10 Plot. It is quite childish, but this is exactly what this game needs. I want to notice the change between characters. Usually ratchet carries the maple on his back and uses it as a satchel, but in some particularly impassable places, you have to manage the maple. Plot - 8/10 The most elegant thing in this game is a variety of different gadgets and weapons. And not one of them does not remain without attention. The game constantly encourages the player for curiosity, giving him various rewards. Weapons-10/10 Working through the levels. The levels are memorable and interesting. They are interesting to study and they are not similar to each other. The game starts with 2 types of weapons, but as you progress, you can find up to 35 types of weapons. Each weapon is good in a separate situation. One copes well with a large number of targets, but has low damage, and some has a huge damage on single targets. Levels-10/10 Bosses. Bosses are very unique. Fighting them is interesting and not boring. What only is the battle with the final boss (Oh, and I was tormented with it). Because of the variety of weapons, levels and bosses can be completed with different approaches. Bosses - 10/10 Well, at the end about the camera. The camera is the most terrible thing in this game. It spoils a lot of chances and it is impossible to control. Camera -7 / 10 Result. The game is really one of the best in its genre. It gives freedom of action to the player, limiting it only by the closeness of the levels. I believe that this creation is NECESSARY for familiarization.. I used to really love this game as a kid, but it has definitely aged a bit over the years. Which largely has to do with it being the first game in the series. The Good: This game started an iconic series for Sony and specifically the PS2. The planets, weapons, and gadgets are cool and creative. Some of the characters have also cemented themselves as bring iconic with very little changes (Quark, Clank, and Al). Also, they do add a since of replayability being able to keep the weapons and trade gold bolts in for gold weapons. The game has some pretty good jokes. The Bad: Regular sized Clank parts slow down the game and turn an Action Platformer into a Puzzle Platformer. And Clank (regular and giant) moves incredibly slow. As I mentioned earlier, the game has dated itself a bit. Which is mostly fine, but with there being no strafe, weapon upgrading, and only having a max health of 8 this wouldn't really be my first pick to go revisit. The Ugly: Ratchet's character/personality in this game is awful and he is very unlikable. However whenever he isn't being an **** he's just generic early 2000s Sci-Fi hero (hard to explain but I'm sure you know the one). I don't blame it on the VA but I can definitely see why in 'Going Commando', Ratchet received a new character and VA. I know I had more negative to say about this game than positive, but the game is still really fun. I still do like it. The gameplay and the mission/rewards are still nice you really do feel like a hero upgrading as you gain new weapons/abilities/gadgets/etc. It's just a shame who you are playing as isn't very likable. Funny how Sly Cooper was the only character to not completely change in the 2nd game in the 3 main PS2 platformers (R&C, Jak, and Sly).. One of the best platformers ever. Recently I have came back to one of my gaming favorites- emulation. I bought a PS2 console, couple of games (Ratchet PS2 series among them). So I dumped the BIOS, got the dump from the CD and fired up PCSX2 - and this game, upscaled to 4K is looking amazing (yeah upscaling is an Emulator perk). Gameplay, fun factor, and craftsmanship - all top notch in this one. Shows actually what we have lost in the recent years of gaming. Modern games have no soul, that extra spice that bonds all together and creates a memorable experience.. This game is the epitome of my childhood gaming nostalgia. I spent thousands of hours enjoying Insomniacs masterfully created platforming puzzles with the swingshot, gun battles and grinding for bolts to purchase the R.Y.N.O. The voice acting is superb and the art direction of the game combined with the witty innuendo makes it one of the best games on the PS2 in my opinion.. ""Ratchet and Clank"" is a highly inventive platformer that's charming and humorous. While it's not the best in the series, this first entry set up a strong foundation for future installments. It's a run n' gun action title that features big wacky guns and plenty of destruction. Some of it does get repetitive, but the game never stops being fun. Fans of Jak and Daxter will love it. I would rate this with a 9 out of 10.. The game that started it all. The original game still holds up to this day although it doesn't have great controls like it's successors What it does have over it's successors (The ps3 games especially) is a great story. Was it good back then? Hell yeah! Is it still worth playing? Hell yeah! It is availiable on ps2 and ps3 in the form of the ratchet and clank collection, both are great but beware that the collection can have some slowdowns.. This game was amazing and was a great start for the series. It haven't aged well a bit, but it was a fantastic game.. One of the classics and original games that combined platforming with upgradable weapons. Super innovative game that really takes upgrading weapons to a new level. It's a super solid platformer that feels really nice to play and really satisfying to grind through. My only real criticism is that the non-platforming game modes aren't that great.. Ratchet and Clank is a fantastic game. With awesome graphics, awesome gameplay, and hilarious jokes, there is no reason you should not buy this game in 2017, If you liked games like Mario 64, and Jak and Daxter, there is no reason why you should not pick this game up.. Quite weak compared to the newer ones but still an awesome game. Ratchet was very unsympathetic and only 6 health points made this game really hard in some parts tho.. The first original Ratchet and Clank game is a spiritual successor to Spyro, and considering how good the Spyro PSX trilogy was seeing a more gun-ho version on top of better camera, controls and platforming was pretty much a no brainer. Seeing the relationship of Racthet and Clank form over the course of the game is great and the low-brow socio-economic humor that bleeds through the game's one off characters really make the game feel unique. The Plumber is a particularly good one off that is so memorable its why he's in almost every RAC game after this. The guns and combat is very fun and good although it suffered from not having a lock-on feature that the sequel would do on top of strafing that is half measured in this with the thruster pack. It's also a hard game where Ratchet can die very easily because his health is similar to Spyro's health with Sparx and not scaled on damage that the series would normalize. The weapons were definitely badass to use and the worlds, their music and characters all had their place and made them memorable despite the shortness each one was. Orxon, Veldin, Kerwan and Aridia are some of my favorite levels in the game and it shows how important the little things matter in the grander scheme of the game. Criticisms I would have is perhaps is some levels are very difficult to navigate through (like the city where Ratchet must go solo due to a lightning storm that prevents Clank from leaving the ship), some enemies are more difficult and cumbersome to deal with and the Hologuise segments (while initially cool) are tedious than fun. It's a game worth recognizing however because it takes the platforming of Spyro and make the combat far more versatile and interesting.. The #1 game of my childhood, and the start to my favorite game series of all time. Platforming is simple and sweet and is made even more enjoyable by the highly detailed worlds it takes place in that for the time, were huger than anything that had ever been seen before. People criticize Ratchet's attitude mid game but to me, the fact that Insomniac tried to develop him in a time when that wasn't done much with platforming heroes is admirable. I love the characters and explosive weapons, as well as the gadgets that mix up the game play and keep it fresh. The only thing that keeps it at an 8 for me is that it's out done by miles by it's sequels. Lack of strafing can become annoying, and the game doesn't pause when using the quick select. Making you a sitting duck whilst using it. Also Ratchet's double jump in this game lacks momentum and he in general can control a little sluggishly at times, as does the camera, but you only realize it as an issue when comparing it to future games in the series. These are little more than nitpicks though, as the explosive action and immersive living breathing worlds more than make up for the game's shortcomings. Top that off with quite a bit of replay value in the form of challenge mode, which offers even more things to acquire and use use than your initial playthrough of the game, and you have a highly addictive and masterfully crafted classic that will keep you coming back to it again and again. Just like it has for me since 2002. 8/10. Ratchet and clank is without a doubt my second favorite games in existence second only to Diablo 3 but ratchet and clank has some of the cleverest secrets I've seen in a video game I've seen in years the platforming is fun, the shooting is exhilarating, and the story is great as well.. A really great game to start the series. Though the sequels were better, there is something special about this game. The only flaws that I can think of is sometimes it feels kind of slow, and if you don't have certain weapons at certain times, it can be a lot harder. Sometimes the checkpoints are in really inconvenient places. But the game overall is great. The weapons are fun to use, it controls pretty well, and it has a lot of comedic moments. While not the best in the series, it's up there.. Ratchet & Clank is a action-adventure platform videogame, developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. + Creative Weapons + Fun Gameplay + Variety Gameplay. I prefer to start game series from the start, so I can see how it evolved from one game to another. So my score is based on the 2016 impression of the game from 2002. Overall gameplay is fun and reminded me my favorite N64 Banjo Kazooie/Banjo Tooie games. Multiple gadgets and weapons makes the gameplay interesting and different. But the story is really basic, this game is for kids mostly. Nevertheless, it's a fun game to spend a couple of evenings on. I'm curious what developers came up with in next titles.. To make up the 2016 video game, I'm here giving this game a review. There's also an upcoming movie that seems to be based on these games. Ratchet & Clank is originality popping out of these guys' ideas. Literally the best game to play while waiting for the movie if you don't have a PS4. This is something you should also be playing if you have both a PS4 and a PS2 with you and you have this game and you're hoping to get the PS4 game.. Most hilarious title ive played since i was 14, and i still would like to play it, the levels are awesome, the gameplay is awesome, i wouldnt call ratchet and clank just a kids game.. The game that started it all, Ratchet and Clank is one of the best third-person platformers in history. With an array of awesome weapons to unlock and use, wonderful planets to explore, brilliant gameplay, unique enemies and a brilliant story, this is a game that well deserves its praise. Like so many others right from the off, I found myself falling in love with both Ratchet and Clank and feeling the addicting need to collect bolts.. This game is up there with Jak and Daxter, but compared to other ps2 games this is ****. If I could relive those few minutes I spent on that crap game I would, because it is the worst memory I have of gaming.. An phenomenal game, an absolute must have for any PS2 or PS3 owner. The gadgets are fun, the boss fights are intense, the characters are memorable, and it still holds up today. I hadn't gotten around to playing it until this year (13 years after launch) and I had an absolute blast. If I had to complain, Ratchet is awfully unlikable as a main character (This was fixed in the sequels) and my deaths often felt pretty cheap. Overall, I loved it, and would recommend it to just about anyone.. A unique gem for the ps2, giving us a witty protagonist named Ratchet, the last of his race known as lombaxes, after he encounters an escaped robot deemed rouge named Clank. Ratchet and clanks quest will take them through many unique worlds, gaining new abilities a weapons to stop a mad business man from destroying your home world.. This is the first game that I ever played and finished. It's stuck with me all these years. The story is very well written, characters are interesting, levels are fantastic with things going on in the background, just simply amazing. I highly recommend that you try this out, it IS my favourite game of all time!!!. This game was once a seed of what is now one of the greatest game series in my opinion. The humour, weird weapons, gadgets etc. help paved the way for future games' releases. The music is one of the best things about the game, and it's interesting to hear some of it in RC 3. The only problems I had, outweighed SIGNIFICANTLY by pros, included lack of strafing","the original Ratchet & Clank was released in 2002 by insomniac games . the worlds were vibrant, full of life, and packed with details that immersed you in every planet . the perfect balance between platforming, combat, and exploration made it incredibly engaging ."
575.Horizon Forbidden West,"Keeps every good thing from the first game and adds small things. Unfortunately not much new things and the discovery feeling is not the same. I really wanted to like this game. I played through the first one twice, and Forbidden West isn’t that different. The game just felt overeburdened with its scope. I DNF’d it after about 25 hours because I was bored. My main issue is how big it is. It feels like it’s huge for no reason other than being huge. I think I would have liked it more if it had a lot less content. I also just did not like Aloy or her sidekicks. Aloy was boring and one-dimensional, and no matter what any one said about anything, she sounded so annoyed and exasperated with everyone and everything. Most of the voice acting is very wooden as well. It feels like the voice acting for a AA studio.. Really beautiful vistas and gameplay. But the story gets boring after a while, too many combat combos and a vast selection of weapons and ammo which is difficult to remember all of them in order to use them. The thing that bothered me a lot was that they made Aloy look like a sassy girl boss who everybody depends on her. The other thing was that the world is almost dominated by strong, hardened , self-sufficient females and the few men the player may encounter are simps, backstabbing cowards, or powerless men who desperately need Aloy to save them. No balance what so ever like the previous game. And since i heard what's all about Burning Shores DLC, this will be the first PS exclusive expansion i wont be playing because enough is enough.. It is good game. Now I'm just going to keep typing so I meet the 75 character requirement.. Like the first game, is so big, hours of gameplay and leveling, killing the worst and biggest creatures, a PS user dont have to miss this game. Horizon Forbidden West is a visually stunning game, with breathtaking environments and impressive attention to detail. The world feels alive and vast, and the improvements to climbing and traversal mechanics are noticeable. The combat remains engaging, with a variety of tools and weapons to take down the massive robotic creatures .However, the game struggles to deliver a compelling narrative. The story often feels bloated and unfocused, with characters that lack depth and fail to leave a lasting impression. The pacing drags in places, and the side quests, while plentiful, often feel repetitive rather than meaningful. While Forbidden West offers a beautiful world to explore, the lack **** story or engaging character development holds it back from being truly memorable. It’s a game that excels in presentation but falters in delivering an emotionally satisfying experience.. HFW is a seamless continuation of the genius of HZD, and while not as mysterious as the first game, it is in no way inferior to its predecessor in terms of gameplay and story. I'm blown away by the developers' breathtaking attention to detail, which even surpasses that of the first game. HFW is like HZD just much bigger in all aspects. It's one of the very few games that made me want to chase the platinum trophy. I can't wait to see more of this wonderful and unique world. PS: I really don't get these ""the main protagonist is ugly and boring"" comments. Aloy is one of the best written female protagonists ever. She's brave, smart, selfless and has such depth of character. She's also gorgeous, a true natural beauty. I don't know what you're expecting, but if you're looking for a woman with make-up, french nails and fake breasts, maybe you shouldn't be playing a game set in a post-apocalyptic stone-age world. Not to mention that I don't get how you can judge a game by how pretty you think the protagonist is anyways. I've never heard that criterion used for a game with a male protagonist.. It’s the worst first party game from PlayStation. I don’t even know what say more. Better play Astro bot or spider man or God of war. This one is is really bad. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I've been playing the game for 120 hours and I still haven't finished it. The world is beautiful. The missions are good. It's fun to fight big robots when you get bored. Most importantly, Aloy is very beautiful :). Its pretty much a copy paste from Zero Dawn with way more boring side quests, a few more things added and looking better game. But nothing special. Even the main story is a lot of talking to tribes, goijg to places and no action…pretty much hours playing boring. They stretched and extended this game for no good reason. Overall it ****.. Just play the first game. The Horizon Forbidden West sequel offers nothing new and most of the game content is sidequest filler that you've seen before. The dialogue writing is particularly bad; all of the female characters are an archetype of the uglified girlboss.. it's just a garbage echo of the original game, with added sidequest garbage, utterly broken exploration mechanics, due to 'procedural generation' and a story that has already been told and so is just a re-visit, with nothing new that can be learned. The game doesn't respect itself when it tells you there's this super urgent mission but then gives you all this sidequest busywork, how can I take it seriously?. I had been looking forward to this game for over two years! I consider Zero Dawn to be a masterpiece of its time, with everything that goes with it. But this trash called Forbidden West is a boring, utterly stupid mess with no atmosphere. The invisible barriers that keep enemies contained are back, people constantly smile at you as if they have some mental disorder or the intellect of a 10-year-old at best. The only fun part was climbing, but that’s not enough to make the game worthwhile. Deleted after 6 hours. A disaster. And this comes from someone who’s been a fan of Guerrilla Games since the PS2 era. But guys, this one is just plain boring.. Graphics and most parts of gameplay are better than Zero Dawn. Story, writing and the odd thing here and there are significantly worse. Overall still highly recommended as long as you’re not bothered by the lazy writing.. Fantastic game, I bought my PS5 with this game and fell in love, I bought Zero Dawn and I'm a fan of the franchise, I think it's the most beautiful game ever made.. Boring quests, Dull and ENT, and the plot. The local tribes, even kind of very violent, behave like visitors to some kind of cultural center, all polite and friendly. The main character is loved and respected by everyone just by default. Her invincibility and infallibility are more suitable for superman, but for an ordinary person, albeit an outstanding one.. It definitely much better in every single aspect compare to the first game Horizon Zero Dawn, and it has one of the most beautiful graphics of all time. It just kind of generic when it comes to open world games.. Wow. The entire horizon franchise just blows me away! I fell In love with zero dawn and the Frozen wilds, and forbidden west and the burning shores are on the exact same level of perfectness! I literally can’t describe how much this world means to me, and it will forever stay in my heart!️. First one was great, this one is extremely boring and has so much time wasting missions. 10) Masterpiece - 9) Amazing - 8) Great - 7) Good - 6) Above Average - 5) Mediocre - 4) Below Average - 3) Bad - 2) Terrible - 1) Pile of **** - 0) Worst game ever contender. A massive disappointment in almost all aspects. I expected the amazing writing of Zero Dawn but with an improved combat to match, but that's not quite what I got. With 100 hours put into this game I can safely say that I do not recommend Horizon: Forbidden West, unless you're a massive fan of Zero Dawn. This review spoils the acquisition of some abilities, but will not mention details of the game's main story or side quests. First, the writing is some of the best I've seen. The new tribes are amazing in concept and execution. The side quests and errands are all unique, and I rarely felt bored doing them. The main storyline doesn't have the same charm as Zero Dawn, but I believe they did a good job at building upon the world, both current and past. The visuals are stunning. Some areas are truly magical, and the new machine designs are top notch too. There are very few visual bugs. Now... the ""fun"" stuff. I'm hitting the character limit, so I'll be brief. The gameplay is embarrassingly bad. Sure, there's a large amount of diversity in open world activities - every tallneck is unique, for one. However, there is also a lot of filler and it's hard to appreciate the content when it's experienced through clunky mechanics. Machine riding is horribly implemented. You can't dodge, movement is janky, the machine attacks are unrewarding and there are few rideable machines. This was fine in Zero Dawn as it was mostly used for traversal, but they should have updated it for the combat mounts. Sunwing riding is cool, but unlocked way too late and we shouldn't have to manually override a Sunwing everytime (apart from the first time). Using machine weapons is as horrible as it was before. You can't dodge and it takes too long to grab. That + low ammo and damage makes it not worth at all either. The Melee combat is better, but only the charged R2 is useful against machines. Ranged combat is still the go-to, but still bad. They removed one of the 2 dodge options (the long roll). The game gives a lot of options like traps, sticky ammo and food bonuses but they rarely are worth the effort. Stamina skills and the ""Ultimate"" skills are welcome additions, but feel like icing on a turd. What makes the combat truly boring is that there's no need to develop strategies against specific machines, or learning their attack patterns: Simply scan and do what the hud tells you. All machines die by shooting the weak points, and all attacks are dodged by pressing circle. The traversal is annoying. The terrain is so difficult to walk on sometimes that it makes me wonder if I'm supposed to be there. It's even worse with machine mounts, being almost impossible to go to places where those same machines had no problem getting to. Even the Sunwing feels clunky and lacks momentum. There is too much of everything. Too many Sunken Caverns, too many Weapon Types, too many elemental effects, and too many useless Metal Flowers blocking a single Medium Cache. Machine Strike is weird. On one hand, I REALLY like it and it makes for a good break from combat, but on the other hand it feels too separate from the rest of the game considering how deep it is. Most games nowadays have minigames, but I've never seen one so detached. The customization is lacking. There are barely any masks and you cannot pick and chose any armor piece, they're all full outfits. Which could be fine, but there are so many that share the exact same model and only change the color. There are like 7 good outfits and each of them only has a single good looking dye, and 2 of these are ported over from Zero Dawn. Even the ""legendary armor"" of this game is disappointing. We went from the Shieldweave outfit which looked pretty slick and added a protective shield on top of your healthbar, to normal ass Oseram clothes with some metal on top and no special abilities. Face paints are really cool, and overall better implemented than in Zero Dawn. However, having to visit face painters in specific settlements to change them at a cost of shards just encourages the player to pick a versatile face paint and run it for the whole game. Everything is so goddamn slow and clunky. I have mentioned the combat and traversal problems, but jumping felt weird from the start and rolling feels ""gamey"". In fact, almost all animations that involve Aloy are atrociously slow and frustrating. The best parts of this game are the ones where I get to talk to characters for long periods of time, and everytime they end I am reminded of why I was so excited to start them. This game was disappointing. Not because it's an incorrigible mess, but because it should have been better. Guerrilla Games put so much effort into making the world the best it can be, that they forgot to give the player the tools to appreciate it. Unfortunately, it's a playable TV show at best and a massive slog at worst. I'll rate it 5/10 to account for the high expectations I had going into it. If you want to buy this game, get it on sale.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. You can see guerrilla games put some real workin this **** is an amazing job. The problem. It's boring. And the people in this world are just so unlikable. Including Aloy. Horizon Zero Dawn is enough. Or listen to media. Elden ring is more interesting.. I've had many bugs and the fights are messy when there is more than 2 ennemies. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Oh my god, this game. I player the first one on Ps4 and loved it but this... It improved on every Single Aspect of the Original, the Story, the Visuals, the Gameplay, the Machines, the World, the Characters it's all just fantastic. 10/10 Must play.. The game is not very impressive that they said. The visuals are nice but its all. A great adventure in this expansive new world. Full of interesting location to explore with new travel methods and characters to interact with. It offers challenging but fair gameplay, with a large variety of enemies machine and human alike. A must have for any PS5 owner. Sound, original story, **** has everything a game should have. Horizon is a true masterpiece. The best ps5 game I've ever played. A bloated and boring, too long adventure that fails to tell an engaging story a fails to deliver a satisfying gameplay - combat gets dull quickly and exploration is a chore. No doubts the weakest ip in playstation's history, and yet it's only only game in Sony's first party catalogue that got a VR game, a Lego game and will get an online multiplayer game. Have with all of them.. It looks great but unfortunately the open world busy work dilutes the interesting bits so much that I ended up skipping conversations and a whole load of side content because I just didn't care. I didn't enjoy melee combat and the stealth archery felt more like cheesing. The majority of the character upgrades didn't feel meaningful in any way.. The last quarter of the play-through was a chore for me.. Counter-counter-culture review: keep protagonist's features the same. This war on ""pretty"" and ""sexy"" is disgusting and inhumane. As if ""pretty"" was only determine by men. As if sexiness was a one way street. I'm so tired of it. Let Aloy be Aloy. Laura Croft be Laura Croft. We have ugly heroes, we have beautiful ones, some ugly because of their personality, some beautiful because of it. We HAVE those things. There was absolutely no need to destroy Aloy just to make a few insecure people happier.. Simply Fantastic and Fun to explore. One of the best looking games. I really started to care about Aloy this time as a character. In my opinion she is like Lara Croft but even more badass.. Despite the absence of facial animations, Horizon Zro Dawn is a lot better than Horizon Forbidden West because this game had too many flaws : -too many duplicates on weapon effects (a bow can have 2 “fire”arrows...) -far-fetched scenario... -hints of feminism ( the first game didn't have any...). It tastes very much like any ubisoft game with with hiding. Don't like it at allllll. Stunning gorgeous visuals, great storyline, memorable characters, THE best music ever. Almost a perfect game where the only negative is a dialogue that sometimes makes the main character seem insufferable.. Great spatial freedom unfortunately without interest because filled with repetitive and useless side missions not to mention the childishness of the disjointed scenario.. Perfect sequel to an already great game. It expands on the gameplay by adding new interesting mechanics which i don’t want to spoil for anyone just stumbling on this great game.. Except for the story, everything is near perfect. The Hook is the monsterhunterlike gameplay!. Very good Game! | Horizon Forbidden West | 95 Points (4,5 Stars) | Story 9P | Side Story 8P | Gameplay and Animation 10P | Graphics and Resolution 10P | Dialogue 8P | Narrative Design 10P | Character Design 10P | Species Design 10P | Dynamic and Variation 10P | Bugs and Glitches 10P. Underrated masterpiece. One of best gameplay of last decade. Good story, not so good dialogs, but that doesn't spoil the game overall.. Graphics and art direction was amazing. Story felt good, expanding more from Zero Dawn. DEI becomes so blatantly obvious once you reach around half way mark. Girl boss galore. Otherwise very solid gameplay.. The sequel is flawless, surpassing the previous title in every way. I love the theme and setting of this universe; they are truly immersive. The story is also excellent, leaving a hook for a follow-up that promises to be equally impressive.. Good graphics and art design, completely ruined by pitiful game design. So many flaws I do not even bother listing them. Just spend your time better.. Incredible game, as a person who does not like AAA titles horizon series just amaze me. Waiting for the next game.. They did it again, but better. Man, what an engaging, fun and beautiful game we have here.. Sony games are really a cut above anything else. Narrative story driven, characters with heart, and graphics that push the art form. 10/10 would recommend.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing game improvements from the first one is masterpiece I can't understand why someone would rate it below 9/10 story graphics gameplay has everything. A large and beautiful game. The developers did their best with the animations and dialogues. Even in secondary quests (of which there are a lot!), characters move, gesture, and comment on recent plot events. This is extremely impressive compared to the generic ""talking heads"" dialogues that plague almost all modern open-world games. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect for me is the map's extreme scale. There isn't much variety or interesting going on there. It's crazy to think that the main plot takes only 20 hours, but you spent 4 times as much time completing secondary tasks and repetitive activities. I wish developers had put their efforts into a smaller, more well-thought-out map and a larger, more in-depth main story.. Years later, there are still many issues with this game, especially with using stealth and navigating terrain. It feels like the developers never cared enough to polish their mechanics. That, paired with the bloated formulaic open world usually associated with Ubisoft games, gives the impression that a quality product was not the objective of Guerrilla games.. Guerrilla, for the second time in a few years has made a beautiful game, the game is adequately challenging and the graphics may be some of the best in any videogame possibly ever. The story is fleshed out and interesting, and the DLC is impeccable as well.. ****... the difficulty is unbalanced, it's unbearable to lose all the time, it gets stuck alas, the movement is rough, completely disappointing, it's exasperating, video games are supposed to be fun, but this is more of a ridiculous attempt to be challenging; unplayable, very unbalanced.. At times when playing this I thought… Wow this is the best looking game I have ever played. It feels like an injustice not to give it a nine, but there’s plenty of surface level rough edges that mar the unbelievable aesthetics: bad animations, graphical glitches, so on. This, combined with awkward combat and odd platforming make it difficult to say it’s amazing, even though it could so very easily become a ten.. This is a prime example of a misandrist game, it does so much right with theworld building but everything else is just a shtty mess. A lot of the lowlifes are white guys, the better male leaders are POC, normally that would be not a problem but this is such a big thing in this game that it just bothers the 10th time it happens. All big sane scientists are female, all those who were responsible for the death of billions were male, all female KIs are good, all male KIs are bad and try to kill everyone... the good male characters are either lowkey or POC, and even the chief with arms thick as a treestump gets his ass beaten by regalla who is like 2/3rd his size and weights probably 50% less than him. Ok i understand that this is a scifi setting, where all the warriors are female (so prehistoric humans had only female warriors? I think they took strong women a step too far,) and robots roam the world. The moment i start to enjoy the game i encounter another idiot, narcissist, psychopath, egoist male figure who does just stirr sht up. I wrote a similar post a few days ago on the subreddit, which had a much lighter criticism,but i still got bashed and insulted by every degenerate there, people who slightly agreed with me got downvoted, at the end mypost got deleted and i got banned and the moderators told me that i should kill myself. However, that did not make this game better or worse but it showed me what kind of degeneracy one has to have to enjoy this game without having a second thought about how antiwhite male this game is.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Besides the glitches caused throughout all of the activities in this game, Horizon Forbidden West is one of the most realistic terrain travel alongside Death Stranding or RDR2. Best graphics to date(writing this in Spring 2024, Hellblade 2 is right behind it, for now). The story is pretty interesting, not as major as the 1st game, but good enough for continuation. The best thing about the game is the fact it's such a beautiful open world full of freedom. Explore the ocean, no game out has it's visual quality nor it's physical structure to match that. One top of all of that, is an expansion that boost graphics, map size, enemies, story etc. Too bad I can't post pictures. I had Forbidden West since day 1, Elden Ring was my GotY too. But Forbidden West have been slept on by many, and deserves it's shine(tho it sold over 8-10 mill before PC release). And like I said, the game can have so much going on, that the climbing can be glitching, the machine combat as well can do allot of janky things to make you lose instantly. I didn't wanna get too in detail, spoiling it, but you must experience this title.... Fun game that improves on the first. But it does have a weaker story in my opinion.. Ive tried to like this game so much, but its impossible. Ive played 50 hours of it now, and i utterly hate it. The enermy are all the same,no matter what attack it is, ammo type, weapone, melee, long range it all does one thing, knocks you down. You spend 90% of the fight watching that stupid get up animation. I utterly hate this game. I get believe theys mess this up so much from the first one.. Graphics are amazing, haptics and triggers even better. Extensive perk system. Fun to play, great open-world, lots of sidequests. Overall, the game's controllability is poor. Really poor. Particularly in fights. Fight system is also dumb. I felt like the game had a 100ms response time. After every knock-down of Alloy, you have to wait about 5 seconds before the game gives you control again. During that time, other machines can attack, and it's a repetitive cycle. About halfway through the game, I switched to the 'Story' game mode because I couldn't fight without wanting to throw the controller out the window. I can handle other games like Warzone and God of War without any problems. I enjoyed the game, but not the fighting system. This is definitely a subjective review. I know it works for others, just not for me. I'd lean towards recommending it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Horizon Forbidden West is a game that did not meet my expectations. The graphics and visual effects look outdated against the background of modern games, and the optimization leaves much to be desired. The controls are also inconvenient, especially during battles. The plot seems unfinished, and the characters are superficial. The game offers little innovation compared to the previous installment. I recommend waiting for discounts or trying the game as part of a PlayStation Plus subscription to rate it at a lower price.. This game focuses solely on graphic technology. The game is not fun at all and there is not a single interesting character, including the main character. The boring gameplay and unimmersive story eventually made me turn off this game.. i dont understand what went wrong the first game was amazing to me and a really good experience this one how ever just felt like a massive slog and a one giant fetch quest and i was just forcing myself to finish it when they do a third game hope they can look back at the first and go off that and forget that this game even existed. While being great at optics, the game lacks with the story. The optics are on par with its predecessor, but the story of ""Forbidden West"" falls waaaay behind. It so pale and interchangeable that you can not connect with aloy even if know whats going on. It plays to safe and there is no depth to the story. You can not discover and use technology of the old world like in ZD and your companions are just chilling in the base while you do all the work. You can just rush through the main missons in like 20-25h just with your starting weapons there is no need to grind, no need to discover the breeding grounds and learn how to overwrite the machines. After the final battel it just fells like you just wasted your time. Hopefully this was just a fluke and the third and probably last title will be back on track with ZD.. Game is state of the art for visuals and performance. Visual like that means immersion Very funny combat and world to explore Story could be better, but overall a must play. Forbidden west so thorughly improves on the mechanics and expands the ideas of zero dawn making for an fantastic experience that is just a cinch short of the original games narritive excelllence. While having an more serious and a bit different aloy, the game evolves and makes her even more human and developed and by the end shes her awesome self. I love the new characters, zero dawn had great cast in erend, aloy, Varl and more like talanain side quest, but i like alva, kotallo, beta, seyka from dlc and such just as much is not more they are so good! The main mechanic improve with expanded great weapons, mine launchers, exploding spears, shredders, and so much variety, Its so good its hard to go back to og without feeling limited. skill trees make builds more fun and varied than before and great and mele is much improve just needing a bit more. Better and even cooler robots arrive with terryfying spinosaurs and more and so much variety with so many enemies pluss amazing flying mounts and added mechanics to help traversal and feel badass. Main story is still really cool expanding ideas and recontextualizing some, though... yeah the main zenith threat feels like this game goes a bit far with its sci fi and ideas. In general its good just jumps the shark a bit but im real excited for part 3s insane setup now. Im all for the expansion and introduction and conflict it brings from zeniths and whats next. Horizons world keeps great locations, tribes and ideas + good realistic diversity in People alive so well. your base is really great and theres so much good voice acting and dialogue. A absolutely great sequel to an already great series that just improves in nearly every conceivable way to me.. Great openworld, diverse biomes, awesome gameplay loop and crafting. Graphically it;'sa showcase for the PS5 running this at 60.. Just like the first one, beautifull game, great graphics, world and good gameplay, but also just like the first one, I couldn't care less about the characters, most of them are written to be very annoying, I had to start skipping dialogue because I justbstoped caring, and the main character has to be one of the most bland and poorly written characters in a long time, they made her have a unique design, but the character is so uninteresting, and it has been that way since the first one.. Horizon Forbidden West is a triumph of game design. The world feels alive and dynamic, with every corner offering something new to discover. Whether you're exploring ancient ruins or battling towering machines, the sense of adventure is unparalleled.. As a fan of the original Horizon Zero Dawn, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Forbidden West, and it did not disappoint! The addition of new weapons, abilities, and challenges makes for an even more thrilling experience.. Horizon Forbidden West exceeds all expectations! The combat mechanics are fluid and satisfying, and the character development is top-notch. Guerrilla Games has outdone themselves with this incredible sequel.. a worthy continuation with positive advantages in contrast to the original, it has become more beautiful, more convenient, more tools, better interaction with human enemies, lacks more bloodiness of what is happening, and more smoothness. As a fan of the original Horizon Zero Dawn, I couldn't wait to dive into the sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. However, what I encountered was nothing short of a heartbreaking disappointment, marred by numerous bugs and technical issues that significantly detracted from the overall experience. First and foremost, the game's graphical performance was abysmal. Despite playing on a high-end gaming PC with top-of-the-line hardware, I was constantly plagued by stuttering frame rates, texture pop-ins, and frequent graphical glitches. It felt like I was playing an early access version rather than a polished AAA title. The immersion-breaking bugs didn't stop there. Quest progression was often hindered by game-breaking glitches, forcing me to reload previous saves or, in some cases, restart entire sections of the game. NPCs would frequently get stuck in environmental objects or behave erratically, completely **** any sense of realism the game was trying to convey. Combat, which was one of the highlights of the original game, felt clunky and unresponsive due to input lag and hitbox issues. Dodging and aiming felt imprecise, leading to frustrating deaths that felt more like the result of the game's shortcomings rather than my own skill or strategy. Perhaps most infuriating of all was the lack of response from the developers regarding these issues. Despite numerous reports from players across various platforms, there seemed to be little to no effort on the part of the developers to address these issues in a timely manner. It's as if they released the game and then washed their hands of it, leaving players to suffer through a subpar experience. In conclusion, Horizon Forbidden West falls far short of its predecessor's greatness, held back by a slew of technical issues and bugs that make it difficult to enjoy. Until these issues are addressed and fixed, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone. Save your money and wait for a more polished version, or better yet, revisit the masterpiece that is Horizon Zero Dawn instead.. Great game with good story, satisfying gameplay and superb graphics. Guerilla games created a masterpiece.. This game is quite an achievement. Best visuals this gen, incredibly satisfying combat, and no matter what any weeb says it’s a solid RPG. That’s right. An RPG! Go cry to your mother. Aloy is a much stronger, and more confident hero this time around, and her missions seems much more important than it did in the first game. If you haven’t played this game then you’re doing yourself a disservice! Play this on the best place to **** PlayStation 5!!!!. It's the first game but with extra steps added to it; the story is fine, the graphics are amazing, the combat has recieved some marginal improvements here and there, but everything els","the game just felt overeburdened with its scope. I DNF’d it after about 25 hours because i was bored . the story gets boring after a while, too many combat combos and a vast selection of weapons and ammo which is difficult to remember all of them in order to use them . the improvements to climbing and traversal mechanics are noticeable ."
576.XCOM: Enemy Within,"A great and really addictive game with all these components. I have beaten it 3 times and still grab it out of my collection every couple of years to replay it. The smooth combination of round based strategy, atmospheric story, management of the head quarter, a lot of change in the missions, new equipment and weapons that can developed though out the whole game is great. Very very much one of my all time favorites among my collection of 250 games. I love this game. I tried XCOM Enemy Unknown before, but after beaten it once, I was done with it. This version however is marvelous!. Enhances the already fantastic XCOM experience with additional layers of depth. A must-play for fans seeking more tactical challenges.. Hugely enjoyable and absorbing strategy game incorporating resource management and turn-based military combat. The addition of ""meld"" adds a time sensitivity to the missions making you balance risk versus reward much more than the previous game and there are added missions that make this an essential purchase, even if you own XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Frighteningly addictive and unlike the PS3 version, relatively bug-free.. How can you give this game anything lower than a 10. They should have a scale to 13 for this game. High replay value. Probably the best turn based strategy game I have ever played. 2k games needs to continue this series on next gen consoles. I hope they take what is good from this game and keep making it better. This game is in the top 5 xbox games I have ever played and I still play it 2 years later.. To answer PKstormy, you payed 40 dollars for EU and EW, it's both games in one. They added medals, research, the terrorists, and more to the game. Like EU I love this title, it's brilliantly done, with enough difficulty to make Dark Souls fans cringe. Don't like to die? Skip this game. Love a game where you need your mind, and tactics then well you get it. Yes, I played the original, yes, I bang on about it. I can't see how a better job of 'updating' the game could have been done. The same sense of panic, chaos, command incompetence, lives needlessly thrown **** only development in gaming since the 90's has been in atmospherics and cinematics, but just look at the wool on Central Officer Bradford's jumper! Look at those birds flocking, and the washing going round as you stalk a sectoid! It was always a game that could make you weep actual tears of rage as well. I'm genuinely pleased that another generation (in gaming terms) can experience these thrills.. -MY REVIEW IS TO HELP THE UNDECIDED DECIDE.......... WOW--AWESOME,,MUCH MORE EXCITING THEN Enemy. Unknown.. -my review will be simple and str8 forward to help someone decide. Not a fanboy or leveraged in either way. --Difficulty/challenge- awesome-can jack it up to hardest after ya get strategy down. It gets hard! --allows to rename EVERY soldier and customize every part of them. The only thing controlled is the ""NICK NAMES"" which is exciting IMO.. -PERMA DEATH mode is awesome. There's no saving and reloading and if you're favorite sniper named after you're BFF,Dad or pet dies, then he's dead! All his upgrades are lost and you have ta start from scratch with a rookie and recreate, or just accept that he's gone permanently.. PERMADEATH MODE adds a dimension in gaming that I've never really experienced b4 and is why I gave this game a 10 instead of a 9.. ------story---pretty cool for a strategy game.... ---graphics- looks pretty. Not gonna blow you away, but enjoyable to look at. Neutral/average.. --controls--BRILLIANT--the battlefield is tiled so ya can move 10-20 spots a turn. The spots on appear during movement.. And the controls are clever and awesome. --camera-- really makes the game.. The right stick moves the camera in 360* and it saves enhances you're perception of decisions.. ---100% solo play campaign mode that has 100% replay ability because EVERYTHING is random. --this game is a must have for me and has opened the door up for me to enjoy strategy games again. And they don't have to be full blown RTS like Command & Conquor,,or. Halo Wars or advanced full military RTS like that.. XCOM stays simple and leaves the advanced part to strategy in story... XCom: EW offers many new maps for players to enjoy. It adds a lot more tactical thought (if that makes sense), however I have found on bug that partly ruined my gameplay. Once I got to a certain point, I was unable to receive any medals. This is one of the reasons I bought the expansion, so I got mad when I realized I couldn't get medals.. Had this been the ORIGINAL release to XCOM, this literally would have been a nearly flawless reboot the the XCOM saga. HOWEVER - Because this xpac really changes absolutely nothing... but adds a few details and a couple classes.. this should have been a simple DLC pack to the original game, *not* it's own seperate game. (Steam REALLY sticks it to you by making you buy *both* the original game AND this one in order to play it.. proving it's just a DLC pack gone wild.) Still, everything that was great about the original is still great here! Plus, you get even MORE great stuff! It's a must buy, and a must play. But only if you havent played the original.. if you have, wait for a steam sale/price drop before buying this.. Enemy Within takes a great game and makes it even better by adding new challenges and variety, including some very memorable scripted missions. My kids and I loved the first one and played hours and hours. Buying Enemy Within started the XCOM craze all over again at our house.. This is an amazing upgrade on Enemy Unkown; Game play has not changed, but your additional buildings and unit options elevate the game to a even more diverse experience. The new maps and missions are more challenging and diverse than the already great originals. The story line has changed not in terms of outcome, but what happens in between. Combined with the customizable game options, the experience feels intense and never unfair.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Definitely a worthwhile play if you liked Enemy Unknown. Took a lot of the ideas I would have liked in the game and added them. Still a few things I'd wish for, such as a standard melee attack, but what game doesn't leave you wishing it had just a little more?. XCom Enemy Within is a great expansion for Enemy Unknown. It provides tens of new maps to battle the alien threat, many new weapons and grenades, Mech suits and Genetic enhancements along with other cool new features that every fan should enjoy. You must play the game and get into it to discover the new features. IT you have a short attention span then don't bother playing this game. This expansion improves enough to make me want to start a new campaign and eliminate the alien threat. AWESOME!. XCOM Enemy Unknown was my favorite game of 2012 right after Borderlands 2. This isn't a full sequel to Unknown, rather it is an expansion. But half the times it feels like an expansion, the other half a sequel. Whats new: Their is a new enemy faction of humans called the EXALT and they are stronger than the normal alien and a bit smarter, such as actually attempting to sneak up right behind you in the middle of a firefight. There is a new material called Meld that can change how you play the game. You can mod your squad into mechs or into having traits similar to the aliens. Even if you bought Unknown, you should definitely give this game a try.. So far I've only played a week with Enemy Within but the only thing I've seen different is getting medals and a few new things to research. This is NOT what I paid $40 for!! I feel ripped off and that this should have been a DLC, not a $40 game! I've rarely written a negative review but I think xcom owes me some money back. I've got hundreds of games and I was excited about the new xcom enemy within. 2k makes a lot of games I like. I give this a low score because I feel deceived and robbed. But maybe there is something (really new) that I haven't gotten to yet with this game.. Honestly I enjoyed this expansion, even though its a console port, which is a rare thing for me as a PC Gamer. Some of this stuff should've been in the core came itself, but Firaxis probably had to milk us a little more and make the original Enemy Unknown fit for consoles. There's a few options added that can randomize your playthrough. The new maps are a welcomed addition, but unless your playing on the harder difficulties, by mid to late game you should have troops that steamroll anything, meaning that your most intense moments will come early on in your game. I'll rate this a 7, with an automatic deduction for being a console port.. As a DLC this would have been perfect. The problem is, it's not. The additional content is very good but adds very little to the existing campaign. If anything the additional content feels tacked on, and really does not give you a feeling of playing something different. All campaign missions play out exactly the same, regardless of the content. Only the EXALT mission do give it a bit of fresh air, but the focus is to little and it's over far too quickly. XCOM: Enemy Within is nothing more than a Game of the Year edition, just with exclusive content added. After buying XCOM: Enemy Unknown last year and ALL the DLCs that have come out since, this copy made me feel a little cheated. If I had waited a year, I could have gotten the exact same game, and saved allot of money. This kind of reminds me of Viva Pinata & Viva Pinata: Trouble in Paradise. or Dragon's Dogma & Dark Arisen Same problem, but at least VP:TIP & DD:DA had significant additions that did revolutionize the gameplay. XCOM: Enemy Within, sorry. But no. While I get that it includes new features that affect core gameplay, it still could have been a DLC, or at least given the option Again, I reiterate, I still thought XCOM: Enemy Within was very good, but just doesn't offer enough extra content to warrant a re-release. Overall: I was a bit disappointed as I had expect some more prominent additions to the main campaign. however it looks like Firaxis either was lazy or playing it too safe to change anything that actually needed changing. But at the very least I will say, yet again, I still liked it. If it had been a DLC, I would have scored it a 8.5 out of 10, but since it was released as a package, I have to grade it the way I see it on the whole. I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't played the game yet, but if you do, don't bother with XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Side note to Firaxis: I am a little disappointed in you. I expect this from Capcom, but not you. I hope you are working on Terror from the Deep, but don't do it like this again. GOTY editions are all said and good, but don't make us buy them just to buy new content... Don't get me wrong. Enemy Unknown is a great game, one of my all-time favorites. At first, I was somewhat skeptical about this expansion. But Enemy Within's expanded content is an improvement in every way, and is well worth the price, even if you own the original. Yes, it is the same campaign, but the combat dynamic has changed with the introduction of Meld, and all of the benefits it provides. The additional battlefields are a welcome change and the inclusion of the last game's DLC really make customizing your troops a lot of fun. Obviously, if you didn't care for Enemy Unknown, this game, probably isn't going to change that. But if you liked it as much as I did, then you'll love Enemy Within.","xcom: enemy unknown is one of my all time favorites among my collection of 250 games . ""frighteningly addictive and unlike the PS3 version, relatively bug-free"" ""like EU, it's brilliantly done, with enough difficulty to make Dark Souls fans cringe"""
577.Red Faction,"This game hits hard from the start. Blasting, shooting, and sometimes sneaking my way through the environments was nothing short of completely immersive. Having played some of the newer titles before this one, I did not expect this game to grab my attention the way it did. I consider this to be the best of the series.. Underrated game, I don't understand why Red Faction 1 was poorly rated for its time. This game deserves to be in the pantheon of the best FPS!. Immersive first person shooter with an innovative feature that enables you to reshape the landscape using explosives; this combined with the sprawling environments and vehicles to commandeer makes it very much a forerunner to the Halo games. Combat can be a little fiddly thanks to the fact that enemies refuse to stay still for more than a microsecond, but atmospheric graphics and a nice storyline make for a quality action adventure.. If you look past the graphics this is still one of the most fun FPS games out there. It has very good controlls, tons of weapons (very satisfying), and a good story. Also enviroments are great. For FPS lovers this one is highly recomended by me. Play it on the emulator and graphics will be not too bad.. At first, it's an amazing experience full of enjoyment. Difficulty is just right and progress is rewarding. It has a length that no modern linear shooter could rival. Then comes the inevitable part where developers run out of ideas and want to make the game harder. New bullet sponge enemies are introduced along with new weapons with insane damage and lots of chances to insta-kill the player. The game becomes cheap and unfair. Any enjoyment gets drained out and it just becomes an idiotic chore. Steady progress at a fair pace gets replaced with trial and error, and skill-based gameplay becomes luck-based. There's no option to change difficulty mid-game and no cheat codes even to help wade through the trash, hoping to see a glimmer of hope again. It's such a shame. The game is so thoroughly enjoyable at first, but then it needs to show you why it was never considered a classic. I haven't been so deceived and disappointed in a long time.. A very good FPS at that time. Good feeling with the weapons. too bad the geo mod is underuse.. It's interesting to observe how, in the years, landmarks and standards in the complex world of video games changed. During the last decade, generally, what has been Call of Duty is comparable to what was Half-Life at the turn of the late 90's and the first half of 2000s. And the result of what Half-Life meant in that period is indeed Red Faction. The plot is actually very interesting and well written, although it doesn't shine particularly. Very clear are the references to historical events such as the Russian revolution and thematics such as the fight against patronage and capitalism itself that through companies oppresses and exploits workers in a vision so futuristic of ancient values. It is no coincidence that Parker is a proletarian, a member of a ""red faction"", which color recalls socialism and communism but also the color of Mars, the ""red planet"". A good fusion of classic themes with equally classic science fiction. You know, video games' world was better once, this is a fact... but if there is one thing that the seventh generation of video game consoles (2005-2017) has improved in all aspects is the responsiveness of analog sticks and aim rendering in first-person shooters – of course never comparable to the deadly accuracy of a computer mouse. This is the real problem of this game: aiming does not work well. For me it's just wrong to play an FPS with auto-aim but after trying playing without it for about 2-3 hours, and I quite skilled at this genre, I gave up... I had to activate it. Even with the ""Fine Aim"" function, certainly appreciable, the situation doesn't change much, and auto-aim is the only way to seriously enjoy yourself. I thought it could be a problem because of emulation, but by checking out an original 2001 review on GameFaqs, it seems like the problem always existed. As I said, certainly, today steps forward have been made. I therefore suggest playing with auto-aim but using ""Fine Aim"" mode to get an extra challenge. In the end, you control the trigger pressure: try to aim manually, if you see that you cannot do it, let auto-aim helping you, it's the best compromise. It's not worth seeing this game become frustrating more than fun. I assume that this problem won't be found if you decide to play the PC version, so go for it. As for the rest, Red Faction is a great video game, indeed because developers knew from who to take inspiration. There is a good variety of weapons, most with primary and secondary fire. There is also use of vehicles like an armed jeep or submersible. The variety of situations actually is even more varied than Half-Life: it goes from simple shooting at enemies to passing unnoticed during espionage and undercover missions. Very sad note for the infamous (optional) stealth section in ""Capek's Lair"": rather than slaughtering every living being in the building, it's possible to go ""unnoticed"" disguising as a doctor and carrying out different undercover tasks to reach the final goal. What is the problem? Well, not only playing stealth guarantees no bonuses, no rewards, but ultimately it's also mandatory to engage in a gunfight with several guards, being with no armor and armed only with a silenced pistol – you cannot take any other weapons when you are disguised. I couldn't believe how much the game destroyed its own coherence, becoming so ridiculously difficult and senseless in the last 5 minutes of that part and making the stealth executive completely useless. And the PS2 version-mandatory auto-aim helps very little since it automatically points to enemies' body protected by bullet-proof jacket while their weak point is at the head. Really, I was speechless: a failure of game design as big as planet Mars itself. Graphically the game is very nice: settings and models of characters and weapons are really well done. Some animations, mostly facial, don't do well today but at the time they were certainly more valid. What really surprises, however, and what demonstrates Volition's tech skill in creating the game, is the destructible environment and interaction capabilities of Geo-Mod: hardly possible at its time – and still today outclasses many modern games – much of the environment it's susceptible to explosions and percussion, breaking up in a realistic way. A system ahead of its time, no doubt. Nice soundtrack, but nothing really special. ""No good idea goes without a few retreads"" a wise video game-related YouTuber once said. And this is exactly what Red Faction is. A game that is son of a legendary success, but it managed to take its own path, with important innovations and a well done design. Let be known: it's not a perfect game, and it has its flaws. But also let be known that it's a game that must be played, especially if you are a lover of FPS games.. A decent game but can get real annoying with all the bugs and glitches in this game.. Still the only first person shooter that allows you to dig tunnels and create bases with a rocket launcher. An all round great shooter for its time.. This game is great, especially for when it came out (that's important). The destructible environments were fun, the environments varied from bunkers to space stations, and the enemies are challenging even on normal difficulty. Anyone who says this game is not good isn't intelligent enough to factor in the age of the game.. Red Faction was great back in the day, but now is beginning to show it's age with blocky and blurry character models, a rather unpredictable method of firing (as in bullets can fire all over the place and not hit once at blank range!) and a laughable plot and in-game **** to say that the game is not fun play now. I've completed it 3 times now and I can still have a blast playing though it again. The geo-mod engine, although ground-breaking is not implemented all that well in RF. I would have been fun to experiment with it, having scenarios that evolve around destroying buildings or walls to find a path. but the G-mod tech is only really used nicely during the 1st part of the game. after that, the game only starts to fall apart. There is a certain point in the game where you start fighting a new type of enemy, mercs. This is the worst part of the game because mercs are equipped with powerful weapons, most notably the rail driver which can penetrate through walls and cause instant death. and seeing that the AI in RF tend to fire IMMEDIATELY as you enter their view, more than a few frustrating deaths are to be expected. The game's soundtrack is low-budget, but surprisingly ambient, at least during the first half of the game, and the voice acting is ridiculous, but funny (case-in-point ""DIE, CAEPEK!!!""). I find this game to be so bad, it's actually really good! everything from graphics to story points my instincts to say that the games crap, but I have fun playing it regardless of whats wrong with it. so take my opinion for what it's worth. if you are tolerant with games, you'll find a great game.. the first FPS game for a console that used duel analog controls that showed us what FPS games could do. now add in destructable enviroments , alot of cool guns , a decent story line and you have a pretty fun game . also had a death match bot system since this was before the Ps2 was online ready and it gave you more reason to play the game.. This is by far one of the greatest games on the PS2, the campaign is long and fun, and only gives you a few chances to catch your breath among the pulse quickening fights, it even mixes it up with some stealth missions, and the story backing it all is pretty good, but gets crazy some times, the graphics do show age as this is an old game, the voice acting and sound effects are awesome, the multiplayer is ok with some friends, but it won't keep your attention long, my main complaints are that it has random load times you'll run into while playing that are pretty long, and that in order to save you have to hold down the buttons for a while in order for it to register and it takes a while to do that, as I said before this is one of the greatest games for the PS2 and can be picked up cheep, so if you still have a PS2, this is a game you should look for, it's great.",immersion first person shooter with innovative feature that enables you to reshape the landscape . atmospheric graphics and a nice storyline make for a quality action adventure . for FPS lovers this one is highly recomended by me .
579.Myth II: Soulblighter,"Great Sequel to a great RTS, the only problem is that it is too short. I reply to this game from time to time.... If any series deserves a refresh (similar to Diablo II: Resurrected) it's this one. Modern Game Economics may not allow for a successor to follow in the footsteps without making it a gross cosmetic-infested cash grab, but a refresh would be a great happy medium.. Unreal game. Single player story is fantastic, multiplayer is great. Game play is unique. Game is still really good fun 20 years on.. This game is pure gold. I remember i had so much fun with it, it was so hard and challenging. One of the best strategy games i ever played. It deserves 10/10. I have been playing this game since I was 7. Get this game, go to ****, download 1.8.1 beta (the newest version as of this review) and play online with the rest of us every weekend. This game is AWESOME once you know how to play it. The 2-team strategy involved with other players is so beautiful, exciting, and complex. Myth II deserves a true sequel.. A fantastic game. Fun single player, awesome creative multiplayer. Mods galore. I had years of friendships and entertainment from this game. Pure strategic, tactical, and teamwork fun. Top honors.","if any series deserves a refresh (similar to Diablo II: Resurrected) it's this one . a refresh would be a great happy medium . single player story is fantastic, multiplayer is great, game play is unique ."
58.Batman: Arkham City,"Played all Batman's games ( except rigins I must say that City is the worst. Messy, boring and hard to hang on to.... Improved upon the character design, combat, & boss fights of Asylum. This game delivers in spades a great sequel.. So if Arkham Asylum was defined by its limits, Arkham City is a careful, considered exercise in stripping those limits away. Its open city lets players be a different kind of Batman to the stealthy predator of Asylum – this is the Batman of dropped smoke pellets and theatrical getaways, the Batman with an ear to the ground for the strong picking on the weak, and the Batman who floats above the city with a gothic majesty.. Great combat and atmosphere, but repetitive missions and pacing issues detract from the experience.. Definitely the best game in the series, it improves on so many things the prequel, Arkham Asylum, also an amazing game, touched on, the dialogue is really funny and definitely one of the best parts of this game, highly recommend this to and Batman fan. I thought Batman Arkam Knight was better. City for me is an average to good game because the story is a bit boring. I played the game but I didn't really like it. The game is cool, but Knight is better. But i recommend you play the batman arkham city. I really love this game. It improves greatly on Arkham City and I'd say it has the best story of any of the Arkham games.. Successfully implements what worked in a more contained Arkham Island to a good-sized chunk of Gotham. The story is one of the best in any Batman medium, utilizing fan-favorite characters in exciting ways and providing shocking twists at nearly every turn. The side missions are great, the combat is as fluid as ever, the gliding is responsive and easy to use. A classic sequel and one that any Batman fan should play.. Batman Arkham City manages to take what Arkham Asylum did and improve on it. Taking you to a larger setting and improving how Batman controls. This is the best superhero game that has ever been made.. It's amazing how they managed to make such a good game with Graphics So perfect with a plot Unbelievable, definitely revolutionized The fighting games!. Just an overall amazing game with everything everyone wanted from from the first game being added and improved still is better than most of the games released today. W stor, w bosses, w character, w all but mid gameplay ....................................... This is the definition **** sequel. It improves the gameplay from Arkham Asylum. has a better story and bosses. Truly a fantastic game.. The peak of the Arkham series, Batman: Arkham City is a masterpiece in both superhero and open-world games. Gliding around Arkham City which feels alive and is filled with activity and content. The visuals are great and the world design is fantastic, I'm not a particularly big superhero-fan but even I appreciated all the small details and inclusions of the Batman Comic stories in the character bios.. Batman Arkham City Is The Greatest Superhero Video Game Of all time. Batman Arkham Asylum already Pushed the superhero and action game genre to new heights, But Batman Arkham City Re-Defines what A Superhero Game really is. The Story is Complex but in a good way, But it does feel like Cat and Mouse at times. Joker Is Dying and he needs a cure,The Only way he can get it is by getting batman to do it for him? How? By Giving batman his blood so he only has 6 hours to live, But batman also needs to stop a New threat, Doctor Hugo Strange And figure out what Protocol 10 is. The plot may sound simple but its very dense and detailed. Now what we really care about, the gameplay. Genuine perfection, The Combat makes asylum seriously look like a tech demo, There are so many new combos and gadgets that really help to flesh out the combat. The traversal is so much better than how practically non-existant it was in asylum, The new dive bomb and slide help you traverse so much faster. The boss fights are Much better than asylum, Clayface and Rā's Ahl' Ghul are highlights. Overall the game really makes you FEEL Like Batman, When there's a stealth section you Really start thinking and planning your every move, You really blend and begin to become the shadows, Its Genuinely a Masterpiece. And its all highlighted by the Great graphics (specifically the original because The Return to Arkham Version on PS4 & Xbox One have a different artstyle.) It's not overbaringly realistic but also not terribly Cartoonish, Its the perfect mix, and the OST Only highlights this, From the Movie-like Main theme to the intense Battle Themes, The OST Is truly remarkable. Overall the game Is A Masterpiece, The entire Game is perfection, Even with Games like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 or Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy This game is The Titan Above them all. Batman Arkhan City is a 10/10 that I Would recomend to Anyone looking for a Game to play.. Good game combat aged pretty well story is good side missions are average But the worst part of the game is riddler trophies. Boss fights are good and so is traversal. Masterpiece. Everything about this game is great. The Game follows the Story of Arkham Asylum and has one of the Best Storys. Just a little better than Asylum and alot of great characters, and the best intro in a video game. 11/10. Finally I managed To do an account just To give this game and absolute 10. The story perfect and the gameplay is great even for the year he was made. I passed years re-playing this game. Because it never gets boring and the predator challenges are even better. The stealth is well thinked, really great. One of the most fulfilling sequels of all time. The game effortlessly one ups the already amazing Arkham Asylum in almost every way and delivers consistently. A great story with plenty of climactic moments, twists and excellent adaptations of iconic characters for fans to enjoy. Exciting and cathartic combat that retains both simple to pick up and rewarding to master which is further improved by added combos and the quickfire gadget system. More gadgets and variety of puzzles or mysteries to solve with them. An ""open"" world that, while lacking the superb, uncomfortable atmosphere of the Asylum, still manages to feel alive and provide an excellent playground for the player to truly feel immersed playing as the Caped Crusader, which is topped off with an amazing soundtrack and immaculate sound design that perfectly sets the tone of the game. It also improves on Arkham Asylum's biggest flaw by improving its boss fights. This game's only hiccup is that some of the side quests can be underwhelming. Side quests themselves can feel monotonous and often just come down to busy work, and encounters with foes such as Deadshot or Zsasz feel quite underwhelming in the end. Batman: Arkham City may just be where superhero games peaked.. Story is so well written. The game is so well detailed that you can be on your 10th playthrough and you will still notice amazing little things you never had before.. You know you've made a masterpiece when everyone's ripping you off and doing it badly, even your incompetent replacements at the company you used to work for and the wannabes at Insomniac who haven't made a good game since the PS2.. this my favorite batman game of all time I had batman Arkham City on XBOX 360 the story is masterpiece and fun and I have Arkham Collection on my playstation. Best game in the world the whole game series great if you ever play it the one bad thing about it is the damn, riddler trophiesbut even though there’s 400 it’s still a great game 10/10 great game. It was perfect. Perfect. Everything, down to the last minute details. Best superhero game. Is an special game for me, because Batman is my favorite characther of DC Comics, i think is a good game, and the best game ever of batman, so you can try play this beatiful game. his history is good and his secondary missions are good too, but the riddler trophies are much, like four hundred forty (440), so in my point of view I am very tired after complete that.. This is a masterpiece, an absolute masterpiece for real gives me goosebumps. Batman Arkham City is the follow-up to the fabulous Arkham Asylum. The world is bigger; there are more riddles, more randoms to fight and more baddies to beat down. The fighting system is still tight. It looks great, and the voice acting is second to **** why the 7? Well, Arkham City is bigger than Arkham Asylum, but it feels more sparse. It feels like someone just said, "" Riddles? Moar! Baddies? Moar! People laughing at you when you die in an unskippable cutscene? Moar! Sometimes less is more people.Also, whoever decided to have the bad guys mock you when you die needs a kick in the nuts.. This game is unbelievable. The story is amazing, the gameplay is amazing and the characters are done perfectly. This is truly a game that will stand the test of time.. my least favourite of them all but looking at how much it improved in gameplay compared to asylum i can see why it is so critically acclaimed. Arkham City is an outstanding example of bringing the Dark Knight to an open-world environment. With a dark and absorbing atmosphere, the game immerses you in an expansive version of Gotham City, full of dangers and secrets to discover. The game system Smooth and satisfying combat, combined with a captivating story featuring several iconic villains from the Batman universe, makes this game an unforgettable experience for fans of the superhero. In addition, the freedom of movement and the number of side missions provide immersion. complete in the life of the Dark Knight.. The Arkham series is the best superhero adaptation to a video game series, and Arkham City is the pinnacle of that. Fluid combat, engaging stealth gameplay, great graphics, plenty of Batman characters, even some less known to the general public, and an amazing story. It builds so much from the foundation of the first game and delivers a masterpiece, not only successful as a video game but also as a Batman novel."". Arkham city an amazing story, great characters, lovely combat, unique puzzles, and butiful visual truly amazing. Batman: Arkham City isn't just a game; it's a magnum opus that redefined what players could expect from a superhero video game. Its flawless combat, immersive open-world design, compelling narrative, and dedication to the source material make it a timeless masterpiece. Arkham City is not just one of the best games ever; it's a testament to the potential of the medium to create truly unforgettable and transformative experiences.. This is the middle of the road Arkham game for me. I haven't played Origins, but it's better than Asylum, but not as good as Knight. Still a great game with great mechanics. Story does feel like a bit of a fetch quest however.. Very poor storyline with constant bugs and glitches.. For it's time, it's a 10. If it was released today of course it would be much lower, but it didn't so here we are.. This game was never good. Very poor writing it was bug after bug after bug. The combat was super repetitive and annoying, which made it super boring because you can tell they were trying their hardest then not have to put any effort into it. Zeros all across the board for this lame Junk and waste of money.. ok rocksteady your games are good but this is your LAST CHANCE to put killer moth into your games if you dont do it next time there will be conseqences. Amazing, bigger than the previous Batman Arkhan and great story.. In my opinion the greatest superhero video game of all time.. To be ÉÉ. Its the best in the trilogy, and it is also the best super hero game of all time so far, the bosses, atmosphere, the joker performance its second to none, truly a masterpiece, go play it.. With somelegendary voice acting and storytelling, Batman: Arkham city accesses the essence of Batman in every way possible. Building on its predecessor, not only does the combat feel fluid and satisfying, but the story and world retains attention throughout the entirety of the narrative and beyond, keeping you playing until every corner of the map is explored. Even then, the challenge maps are a welcome addition to keep the player’s attention, truly testing a player’s knowledge of Batman’s abilities and strategy beyond spamming an attack button and hoping for the best. Even with its age beginning to vaguely show against the newest gen consoles, I cannot recommend this game enough.. A trendsetter and goliath of the Third Person action adventure genre, although it might be a bit overrated. The combat is fun at first, but really does boil down to mashing two buttons until everything dies on your screen. Open world traversal in top tier, and ambiance and story are incredible, although the side quests are just okay. Overall, this is a classic you should definitely play, but you could go for Arkham Knight instead which is a slightly better version of this game.. Great story and bosses. Good story, good mechanics, good open world.. best superhero game. Holy crap is this game's story massively overhyped. Anything interesting about it (Hugo Strange and the opening sequence) gets immediately sidelined in favor **** fetch quest for a plastic bottle. To its credit however the ending sequence is pretty good, its only a shame the game wastes your time and a great character (Hugo) while getting there. Arkham Knight does everything this game does but better.... Batmobile included. incredible game. an overall great game. it was a lot like arkham asylum but that isn't really a bad thing. this game exceeded my expectations and built on an already great game.. I played this game several years after Batman: Arkham Horror. The latter was a good game with a few things I really didn't like. In this sequel, I have every little part I didn't like plus a heap more while at the same time what was good has gone.. Possibly the best superhero game ever made. Everything the original Arkham does right, this does more of and then some. The story is better than ever and exploring a whole city and some of it's underground really expands on what this style of game can do.. Fun and engaging Batman game. Has the perfect mood and stalking around gotham fighting thugs and investigating supervillains is super fun. Drags towards the end and the story is forgettable, but gameplay and atmosphere is the star. One of the greatest games of all time. I’ve played it countless times and I’m always amazed.. A masterpiece that offers everything a game should. I wasn't even into Batman and I still loved every second of plating the game. Both combat and stealth are fun. The story is engaging and nail-biting. OST is god-tier especially the main theme. What else would you want?. Following up on one of the best action games in recent memory, Batman: Arkham City manages to up the ante in almost every way you can imagine. While it loses some of the focused and contained psychological elements of Arkham Asylum, this sequel makes up for the loss in sheer scale and ambition in its story, side missions and extra DLC content. Not only did Rocksteady create a bolder and more ambitious game story, but they also created more memorable villain boss fights, multiply Riddler challenges by 5x, and just smash so much more content and things to do in the game. I loved the Catwoman and Robin DLC challenges and options in-game as well as the introduction of new skins to play with and of course the much larger map Batman has to fly across. Also important is the slightly refined combat mechanics from Arkham Asylum. One of the very few complaints I had with Asylum was its occasional combat mechanic issues and clunkiness that made it less fluid than hoped for. All those issues were fixed in the sequel. If you're a fan of Batman games, this might be the definitive Batman game out there (still need to play Arkham Knight). The story, challenges, gadgets, content, and overall experience make this simply one of the best games I've ever played.. A game even better than it's already great predecessor. The returning voices of Conroy and Hamill and a great story with some cool boss fights.. Loved this game this is an awesome game almost have all the achievements very good. Perfect! Only a few games have ever gotten a 10 from me and this is one of them. Arkham City is a great follow up to Arkham Asylum in every way. The world is bigger and the combat is finally perfected. This game is one of the best in my books. Long live the Bat!. My unpopular hot take is that this is the weakest of the trilogy. This is an amazing game, don't get me wrong, but it misses in some really big areas. The world, art style, story, and puzzles are all amazing. The voice acting is again flawless and a comic book fan's dream. But man does this game get frustrating towards the end. Here is why... The combat is more repetitive than the first game. The enemy variety seriously lacks to the point that the only ways the devs can make the game harder towards the end of the game is by throwing more of the same at you, which really just becomes a battle of maintaining a good health bar. The back tracking is somehow worse in this game and even less justifiable. There is a whole city this time, not just an asylum and somehow you are still made to repeat areas over and over in the main story. Spoilers here The story is great aside from Talia. In no way is she developed or interesting enough for me to give a rip that Joker kills her in the end. i don't know why the short amount of time in the third act of the game appears to be enough development for her to the devs, but it wasn't. It wasn't emotionally impactful at all. Edit: interestingly enough Arkham Knight made me dislike this game even more. If you subbed in Jason Todd for Talia the set up for Knight would have been so much better and paid off in a really great way. What a missed opportunity. Other than those complaints the story is great, the combat feels good, Joker is an amazing villain, and there is plenty of side content to go around. This is an amazing game with some frustrating problems.. More of Asylum, but with a much larger world. Can't really go wrong with that! At the time of release, I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't too much evolution in the melee combat. Don't get me wrong, I love the combat in all of these Arkham games. Some of the best around. But this games fighting mechanics are virtually the exact same as Asylum, down to the enemy types and everything. This was slightly disappointing. Also, this is where the Arkham stealth gameplay began to frustrate a little bit. Not enough options. Almost every stealth section is identical to the other. But it was a bit more... forgiving due to the bigger environments in City.. Building on every success of Arkham Asylum, whether it's gameplay, graphics, exploration or storytelling, it's no question why this is one of the best superhero games ever.. The main campaign is pretty good but the side missions and other side content is boring and tedious to get through. Note- I said a lot more but Metacritic felt like deleting 2 paragraphs worth of writing after hitting submit thanks Metacritic for barely functioning half the time.. Remember, a ten does not equal a perfect game. Let's start with some positives. All of the positives that went with its predecessor belong to this game as well. Combat is still fun and wildly addictive. The vast array of gadgets is fun and sometimes challenging to use. There are even some improvements, like more gadgets unlocked from the start, and gaining new skills has been made easier. The story is better overall than in the first one. There are a few negatives, however. While I did get lost a few times in the original, I got lost way to many times to be considered passable while playing this game. This style of game, in my opinion, should have stayed with the smaller, more enclosed map. I also feel like the story gets cut off way too soon. After the first boss fight with Ra's A Ghul, i didn't expect to see him again, until it's revealed that he's been working with Strange all along. After that, I was fully expecting another boss fight, perhaps after the death of the Joker. The first game ended just at the right point, so I dont know what happened here. Anyway, its a great game overall, just slightly worse than its predecessor.. One of the greatest games ever made. Rocksteady improved on everything from Arkham Asylum and more. The story is great, and the voice acting is superb.. Batman Arkham City: Yeah for International Video Game Day why not do the best game of all time. In Batman Arkham City you play as Batman trying to find out what Protocol 10 is and to save yourself from being poisoned from the Joker. That’s really all I can say without spoilers because I have beaten this game 15 time I have 3 copy’s of the game and I no regrets. So we are going to start with the voice actors obviously Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are Batman and Joker, whenever those two have scenes of dialogue together I always say the lines with them. I love why other cast members to Nolan North as the Penguin, Troy Baker as Two-Face and Tara Strong as Harley Quinn they are all so great. But the bosses are where it’s at it greatly improved upon Arkham Asylum, and now the bosses are big and amazing Solomon Grundy and Mr Freeze are my favorites. The graphics are great and so is the music it’s so atmospheric and gameplay is great as well, punching and flipping around sound amazing but nothing compares to just gliding around Arkham City. Overall this is my favorite game of all time some games have come close but I don’t think it will ever get replaced. Ranking Masterpiece.. Masterpiece. One of the best batman stories and one of the best stories in general put in the form of a video game. Amazing gameplay, top tier voice acting, and a fantastic score make this game spectacular.. This game was inevitably what got me into Batman. The story, basic in its nature but perfect in its execution. The character are well adapted and their continuation from the first game is phenomenal. This game will always be held in my heart as one of the greatest experiences I have ever had.. Atmosphere: 10 Enjoyment: 9 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 9 Music: 8 Story: 9 Total: 9.00. It's like the development team at Rocksteady said, ""Okay, now everything that made Asylum fun, let's scrap that and go w/ garbage this time around!"" It starts off w/ a plot that had me rewatch the intro 3x because I thought maybe I hit a button and skipped something by accident. The Riddler challenges are changed to time-based and Simon Says memory games. And the flow of the gameplay has been replaced w/ an open-world feel, complete w/ side missions. Some of them which are no more than gliding thru rings, something that made Superman 64 one of the most hated games of all time, but is seen as such innovation here, lol.. By far one of my favourite batman games with so many improvements from Arkham Asylum with gliding and stealth as well as combat this is up there as one of the greatest superhero games to date.. Awesome action packed and cool graphics and everything else as well as hell boy. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Batman Arkham City has to be one of my favorite videogames that Ive EVER played. The story is absolutely phenomenal and the gameplay is REALLY good too. I also really liked all of the side characters too. I loved being able to do missions and free roam as Catwoman. This game kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time I was playing it. Definitely a must play for all gamers.. 10 years later and this game still remains as probably the best superhero video game ever made. Damn this was good. I think I've finally found a game to take away Halo CE's title as my favourite game of all time. It keeps everything that made Arkham Asylum so good and expands upon it so much. The bosses are all unique and incredibly fun to interact with, the open world Arkham City is so fun to grapple around in and there's so much to do! I don't usually do many side quests after I beat a game but Batman Arkham City is just so compelling and entertaining with all it's secrets and side stories. The story is also way more expansive than Arkham Asylum and is just incredible. From start to finish you'll be completely hooked. Usually I play a game like maybe an hour every day or two but this game was just too fun to turn off. Can't wait to finish off the trilogy with Arkham Knight.. This game is one of the best i have ever played. The combat is awesome with the many combo attacks and the freeflow challenges and all the gadgets make the game so fun to mess around with. The story kept me glued for hours as i played trying to get all the side missions and riddler challenges and tried to get 100% on it. The voice acting is great and the story is fun to play and it's one of the few games that i can replay 100's of times and never get bored. Getting the riddler trophies was a challenge but it was fun and i could collect most of them along the way so by the time i got finished with everything else there was only a few trophies and riddles left. I'm glad that i bought the game when i did because this was one of the best there is. It's a gift from the video game gods that brought us this creation. I cannot complain much about the game except for the fact there are so many riddler trophies (its not enough to knock it down to 9) but other than that i love this game and it'll forever be in my heart.. Gameplay..............Amazing Graphics................Amazing Story.......................Amazing Score.....................Great. The best ""beat 'em up"" game I have ever played. Pros: - Ability to play as Catwoman(DLC), Robin(DLC) and Batman. Both have their unique styles of combat and methods of movement through Arkham City. - Graphics are gorgeous. - Arsenal of side quests, which add to the story. Riddler's trophies are back again, and this time, they are a bit more of a challenge to obtain. - Arkham City is a great sandbox. The cleverly placed grapple points and environment will have you swinging, climbing, and gliding with satisfaction. - You get a chance to work in the same interests as some villains, which is a nice twist compared to Arkham Asylum. - Gadgets are unique and their applications are very cool. Every playable characters have their own unique upgrades also. - Conversations throughout Arkham City between the inmates give more information about the plot as it is updated through Batman's actions. - The cries of the political prisoners are gruelling enough to make you want to save them. - Combat has improved from Arkham Asylum. There are more variety of skills you can learn to handle enemies with new equipment. - Many villains are featured. In the main quest, without DLCs, most only appear for a short duration. With DLCs, they will appear again for the side quests. - The precision in selecting the gadgets, located on the diagonals of the d-pad, have been improved from Arkham Asylum. Cons: None (nothing major), in my opinion.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Yes it does in fact, make you feel like Batman. My favorite open world game of the xbox 360/ps3 era.. BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY and BATMAN: ARKHAM ASYLUM are the two best Batman Games of all Time. Great Graphics and Sound, great Story and Fun. Masterpiece!. The perfect comic book game. It doesn't get better than this. Excellent performances and a powerful ending.. Arkham City is a beautifully crafted experience, with a whole host of diverse villains that draw you into the Batman Universe. A narrative arc that twists and turns with excitement. There are plenty of memorable moments during the runtime of this campaign, and after I completed it I immediately jumped into a New Game Plus. The predator sections are the highlights of the game, with music that ramps the tension. The combat sections are also fun, if a little repetitive.. finished this one before finishing AA and loved both but i like this one more cause it lets you loose in no time and you are free to kick ass. cant wait to get the goty edi for pc and try to complete it this one might be worth it. Wow! Perfection, that is the word that describes this game, one of the best videogames of the past generation so far, and for me probably even the best. An astonishing and incredible masterpiece in which every character is perfectly implemented and the story is gorgeous, how can we forgot that epic ending??. EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME IS PERFECT.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: AWESOME. Story: AWESOME. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue/Voice Acting: AWESOME.. Just when you think the gameplay can't get any better it does. Everything right about the first game has been amped up here. The look, combat, character arks, and even riddles, it all improves here and that's saying a lot after playing the first one.. What an awesome game. Best one in the franchise by far. Great combat, repetitive but never boring. Also the best story out of any batman game. This game had started out as a fanboy choice due to the game's protagonist being the Caped Crusader, but had ended up as a fascination and objective to complete the entire Batman: Arkham series. The game's got the story line, the characters and the secrets that make up a great superhero game. The involvement from the range of villains and the main antagonist, The Joker, make the game better and build the protagonist to the top tier of gaming characters. I gave it a 9/10 due to the quick ending and details such as involving Mr. Freeze and Clay-face at the time when Batman is on the island.. This made me feel like a Batman the combat and equipment to were amazing at least in my opinion. It is breath Taking.. Batman: Arkham City is bigger and better version of the Arkham Asylum improving on everthing in the previous game with an open world, the best story of the series and more combat options to a already great combat system. For everyone who loved the first game or Batman fans out there, you'll love this.. In reality this probably is the best Arkham game but it just doesn't grab me in the same way that Asylum did. With that said, this game is still fun as hell.. Batman Arkham City was an excellent sequel to Arkham Asylum! Rocksteady improved on every aspect of the game. Dont get me wrong, Arkham Asylum was great, but Arkham City is PHENOMENAL! The map is good size, not too big and not too small, just perfect. The story is great, and all the villains was great. The ending with Batman and Joker is a very emotional scene. Normally games dont get to me, but that scene at the end did the trick. I loved how Ras and Talia al Ghul were in this game. If you have never played the Arkham games...WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU???!!!. Probably the best superhero game of all time. Story DC quality pattern, tastefull playability, exploring arkhan finding rewards and missions is quite funny. Player starts playing and can't stopping. Modern classic. Everything that Arkham Asylum amazed with, this game perfects. In my Top Five of All Time, Arkham City takes the open-world aspect and multiplies it by five. While it doesn't fill it with as many important events (Asylum used every area to it's full potential, City touches on each of them maybe once or twice max), it provides so many areas to roam, explore, and clear of hostiles. Endlessly impressive and entertaining, City prides itself on it's large map, unpredictable story, and perfect gameplay. Customization is limited but with a character you don't want to alter, the lack of options is in no way a detraction. You still get new weapons, abilities, and tech to ease combat and make the game more fun. You truly feel like a superhero when playing this game which makes the game fairly easy to beat, but it's even easier to spend more time than necessary beating the story. The gameplay is more fluid than any other game I've p","the story is one of the best in any Batman medium, utilizing fan-favorite characters in exciting ways and providing shocking twists at nearly every turn . the side missions are great, the combat is as fluid as ever, the gliding is responsive and easy to use ."
