814.Zeus: Master of Olympus,"Zeus should have been the pinnacle of Sierra's city builders, but it falls a bit short. The general style and atmosphere is great, just like with Caesar and Pharaoh before, Zeus really provides a strong ancient Greek atmosphere. Basing the whole combat system (citizen army) on that was a bold move, but at least for historical accuracy it was a good move. Production lines and needs are quick to understand, getting an economy rolling does not take long. It took some time to get acclimated to it when starting on Olympian difficulty, but once you got a basic housing layout going, it is easy to build up from there and calculate needed resources. Roadblocks do a lot of the heavy lifting they were made for. I like the agora as market replacement. I liked the format of the adventures, which are based mostly around one city and instead of switching cities every mission, you come back to your working city with new challenges. it is a bit abusable - you could just generate money in one mission and keep using that money the rest of the adventure, but money is rarely a challenge anyways. Diplomacy in this form is new, you have more options in interacting with other cities: coqnuering, raiding, bribing, asking for support. As a concept that is a great addition and fits the diplomacy between greek city states very well. The UI is very simpel and in the beginning it looks smooth and clean, but over time I started wishing for Caesar III's advisors. It required a few more clicks but would also give more information. If they wouldn't be any Zeus specific negatives, the game could be a 10/10, but sadly there are several: The game is very limited, after one or two adventures you have seen 95% of the game and adventures/missions are not very unique. Technically that is an issue for every city builder, but Zeus grew stale surprisingly quickly. Combat ****. Combat in Caesar III was fun, but in Zeus it is just bad. Requiring elite housing for actual troops is an interesting concept but in reality it means you cannot do anything militarily until you are capable of supporting enough elite housing. Combat is just clunky - having to mobilize every unit one after another and jumping back to the palace before moving them where they should move just feels bad. That certainly does not look like 2 years of progress on top of Caesar III. Also, combat is just boring, troops run at each other and you have to hope that no enemy just runs trough your lines. Ship Combat is basically having more ships than the opponent and just right-clicking the enemy's ship. It is great to have two different pools of units for attacking/defending different cities, but sea combat itself is very basic, too basic. Playing on Olympian difficulty is more frustrating than challenging. ""Randomly"" the game drops mythical beasts into your food economy, cities rebel constantly despite bribing them and once one thing goes wrong it is an almot unstoppable downwards spiral - an attack decimates your army, a mythical beasts destroys your economy so you can't summon the appropriate hero and with your economy in shambles, your houses devolve and so your army disappears. It was challenging in theearlier adventures, but got repetitive very quickly and finishing adventures was more a slog than an adventure.. Played as a child. Then before the university, when there was free time. Now I decided to buy it in Steam and to ply the third time. To build some ancient cities, to meet some cool gods. In fact, for its time, it was a great city-building game. I liked, literally, everything except the military part - it is primitive and crooked here. It was necessary either to do it normally, or to throw it away and make the whole game just about construction and trading. If you have never played this game before, you missed a lot in your childhood :). Best economic strategy! Many hours of my life was in that game:) Not fast, but very interesting game.. Oh yeah, this one is an all time favorite! If you mix SimCity with greek mythology and awsome gameplay, you get Zeus: Master Of Olympus! The mechanics are simple but clever, sound and graphics are beautiful and you get an overall great experience. A must play for strategy and building genre fans!. best city building game, even in today's terms it would be hard or impossible to find a better one. Very fun game, addictive and rich with all of its possibilities. The graphics, even though outdated, are charming and colorful making the game pleasant to play along with the Greek styled soundtrack. Might not be as complex as all other RTS games on the market, but for a 13 year old game it's simple nature makes it a gem to play. Good god, they sure don't make them like they used to. It's been 12 years since i first played this game and i gotta say it has aged well. A must play for city-sim fanatics, casual gamers and everyone in between. Google for widescreen mods.. Zeus is by far one of the best city-builder and resource management games of all time. It baffles me that this game really hasn't had a bigger effect on modern games of the same genre. Ironically, though, the ""full simulation"" aspect of EA/Maxis' new Glassbox Engine does seem to emulate some of the same features. For instance, in Zeus you build a fountain to distribute water to households via water carriers. In SimCity you build a power plant and agents go out from the power plant to bring power to households. That's not to say SimCity is a copy of Zeus; it certainly isn't, but it is funny to point out that the grand ""full-simulation"" functionality that was supposed to make SimCity so much better than it's predecessors is actually lifted from a game 13 years prior---and I'd say Zeus is actually on roughly the same scale in terms of map size. Not to mention, Zeus (and Poseidon, for that matter) has a surprising amount of depth and each city you build may require a different strategy for maintaining a positive income and expanding your city to achieve your objectives which include a variety of cultural, military, mythological and economic goals. If you aren't interested in following orders from the gods, the game even provides a sandbox mode, too. My only complaints about this game are some minor flaws due to its age. First, while there are mods out there to add more screen resolution options, the game itself doesn't include widescreen functionality. Secondly, there is no ability to zoom in or out of the map which takes some getting used to. Of course, if you're interested in city-building games at all and perhaps even tycoon games, I say give this game a try.. Can't tell how many hours I've spent playing it since it's release, would probably go for thousands, anyway, this is one of my personal favorites of all time!. I don't even know what to say; this is one the the greatest games ever made. Years of city building developing experience went into this, and it shows. Truly an opus from an era that should have never ended. Don't forget to grab the expansion if you can find it, hopefully GoG will pick this up soon enough.","the game is very limited, after one or two adventures you have seen 95% of the game and adventures/missions are not very unique . combat in Caesar III was fun, but in Zeus it is just clunky - having to mobilize every time you need elite housing is just clunky ."
815.Tales of Arise,"Best action-jrpg I've ever played. Graphics are stunning, the story is great and the gameplay is exciting.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The art is beautiful, the mechanics are good and the story is catchy. but none of those things are a 10. also the game is not that fun, is a little slow. Could have gone without every character yelling every move they do, but was a fun game.. The game excels in its beautiful world design and fluid combat system, offering a rich, engaging experience for both newcomers and fans. However, some pacing issues and repetitive side quests slightly detract from the overall experience. Despite these minor flaws, ""Tales of Arise"" stands out as one of the best entries in the series, delivering a memorable. Good game great combat good story the graphics are very sharp on PS5 this is honestly what FFXVI should’ve been. I rate this game a 8.6 It has wonderful, likeable characters that you care about and wish them well and they are all full of personality, nice large world, plenty of activities, a great story with twists (and some plot holes but nothing emersion breaking), and fun combat. If you're a fan of the series I think you will like this game. CONS: I think there are too many iteruptions via skits, which are panels with minimal voice over. They were fine in the beginning but there were so many i skipped most of them in the second half of the game. Plot hole is kinda big but i guess we need to sweep it under the rug in order for the story to keep its course. Good action based JRPG if you are in to it, with a very JRPG style story.. Great story, great combat system, great map, great leveling system, great cutscenes, great bosses, absolutely one of the best RPG gamesI have played in my life. MUST PLAY.. Damn, there is so much to be said about this game... Its absolutely fenomenal ! I love everything about it, it really has something in it that keeps me from leaving it alone.. The characters are great and the music is perfect. What I like more is the combat system.. Great history and scenarios, the gameplay is kinda slow but, still being a good action rpg. Tales of Arise is a strong return to form for the Tales franchise -- easily the best entry in many years, and among the series' top installments overall. Arise is at its best with its combat (possibly the best in the series), with each party member's unique abilities tailored to specific enemy types, allowing the player both freedom and incentive to mix and match. The story is among the most ambitious for the Tales series, focusing on heavier themes, though never devolving into a dour slog and keeping true to the Tales series overall light-hearted tone. While it may drag at times -- especially with the game's endless and often tedious skit sequences -- and while the game's themes aren't always successful in how they're presented, the attempt overall feels earnest and the result works for the most part. Tales of Arise may fall just short of the upper echelon of modern day JRPGs (such as Persona 5, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Dragon Quest XI, Xenoblade 3, or even the recent Like a Dragon games), but it is still a very worthwhile journey to take on its own.. Decent game that gets really repetitive towards the end - boring the player, something no game should ever do. What ToA really needed was a better game direction to connect good pieces into something great. Do we really need fishing minigame, farming drops or being bored to death with Skits just after 40 minutes cut-scenes marathon? Why is it impossible to level up and EXP points drop almost to none as soon as we reach EXP level of monsters? Why do I have to farm monsters to forge/craft a stronger weapon instead of just allowing me to buy it? Who considers it fun? I understand best weapon in the game for each character, but every single one? JRPGs used to be a story driven games, that if became too difficult, one could spend hour or two on farming to overcome difficulty spike. Why turn JRPG into something it is not? ToA could have been stellar modern JRPG, sadly it is not and it only shows why this genre is now in decline.. One of the essential JRPGs, for context, also really liked Tales of Symphonia, but otherwise had very little Tales game experience. I also enjoy Final Fantasy, Ni No Kuni, Dragon Quest, and Persona 5 to name a few.. Shionne is a lot of fun to play, if you like the red mage playstyle from Final fantasy then Shionne is for you. Story drags for a bit towards the end, and final dungeon is generic and boring.. Tales of Arise is a great game and a great Tales of game. The endgame content is also great to have another challenge after the main story.. Great story, great combat system, great map, great leveling system, great cutscenes, great bosses, absolutely one of the best RPG gamesI have played in my life. MUST PLAY.. My Goty 2021! I love the Combat+The Story is epic! Cant wait for The New Tales of !. main story was nice and surprisingly **** kind of addicted to this game for some time. i also liked characters a lot, you want to follow their story. neverthelss, for me combat system was best part of the game, very dynamic and addicting. game is worth all the money. a bit sad that dlc is short. o say I’m addicted to this game is an understatement. The gameplay is glorious, there’s so many layers and choices. Graphically it’s beautiful, both in environments and character design. The amount of content available is plentiful. I’ve never been a huge lover of JRPGs but this game has broke that trend.. Shining diamond of ps4 time. One of the best rpg on ps4. Must have for anyone who like rpgs.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I really like it. The beginning isn't a total mess of Cutscenes where you get bombarded with Lore and stuff, but it also isn't like the game throws you in and doesn't guide you any further. The fighting system is nice and smooth. I also think the strategy menu is really sophisticated. This game really reminds me of Final Fantasy 15 (which is my favorite game till this day). Clear recommendation from my side for Tales of Arise.. One of the essential JRPGs, for context, also really liked Tales of Symphonia, but otherwise had very little Tales game experience. I also enjoy Final Fantasy, Ni No Kuni, Dragon Quest, and Persona 5 to name a few.. At first it wasn't anything special for me. Just a normal jrpg with nice battle mechanics. But something was keeping me engaged. And to be honest I wasn't exactly sure what... But near to the end of the story I finally understood what was that. The characters and the bonds between them. It was such an amazing storytelling game that honestly I constantly wanted more and more. I was absolutely thrilled while seeing this cast of characters laughing to each other while doing some random side quests. And the story of those cast was an absolutely outstanding point of this whole game. Besides of the story, graphics design and music were absolutely beautiful! It's not game for everyone but surely it's a game for a great story enjoyers!. I finished it lat night, this game is over rated,the graphics and music are good, but the story is not good and the system is so basic that I finish it using 2 moves only. Aslo the upgrade is so basic and the side missions are boring. The start was good , but after 30h I wanted to drop the game.. I cant force myself to play it really , way too many conversations... combat is basic with no tactics whatsoever , fighting same enemies over and over. Maybe I expected more of it and its just another square Enix jrpg. Very good music and voice acting on the bright side. Finished it two days ago after finishing FFXVI, and I can barely remember anything about FFXVI. That's how much **** game this one is. And I don't care what people say, this is how a good JRPG should be. A GOOD F..KING HAPPY ENDING. IS IT SO HARD SQUARE ENIX?!. Bought the games cause of the high score. Bland charachters, bland story, visuals and combat system is just meh.. In my opinion best anime game on ps5. THIS is what a MODERN JRPG should look like! Sadly instead, most JRPGs nowadays still look like Nintendo Wii Games. If you love JRPGs, if you love Anime like characters, if you love huge Worlds and compelling story telling with a lovable cast of characters. Then you've come to the right place. Tales of Arise is one of the best JRPGs and Best Looking JRPGs I've placed in years. I can't recommend this game enough.. Every new decision they made was a good one. Absolutely amazing game. Easily in the top 5 in the series.. This game was my introduction to the Tales of series, after all the praise it got, I was curious to check it out so I decided to play it. To be completely honest, I got into the game wanting to like it, but unfortunately from the first few minutes, I realized that it's just going to be a typical JRPG with some generic plot points and common anime tropes. Well, what I got is exactly that, the game is nothing more but the most basic and uninteresting JRPG I've played so far. From beginning to end, nothing really happens, the story is monotonous, and the last few hours are a slog to go through, the final dungeon is exhausting, filled with overleveled spongey enemies and terrible level design, and the ending is absolutely pathetic and nonsensical. As for the characters, the main cast is underwhelming, there's barely any development, and the side characters are very one dimensional and forgettable. I don't want to seem very negative, because I actually enjoyed the game for the most part, the gameplay is good, the graphics look fantastic, various different worlds to explore, beautiful landscapes and environments, cool looking animations and great visuals. I actually had fun solely because of the gameplay, and it motivated me to explore a lot and do side quests and interact with the world for many hours, even though there the side content isn't anything special, there's a decent amount of things to do. That being said, I wanna point out that the game itself seems to have taken a lot of inspiration from other JRPG titles, but the problem is, it never succeeds, it always tries to do something big but ultimately falls flat, as if it's not capable of reaching that peak yet. In fact, during some parts of the game, I could tell that it's a little bit rushed, especially towards the end. Personally I'm disappointed, is it a solid fun game? In some ways yeah, do I recommend it? Not really, I mean if you're craving to play a JRPG then maybe, but there are superior JRPGs out there that do everything this game does but better. Final Rating: ""Above Average"" ~ 5.5/10.. Only Tales game I have played and its very good.‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎. Overall a very enjoyable game. Alphen and Shionne relationship carries the story a lot, and I have to say that i liked their interactions very much, they were intense yet simple and realistic. The fighting system is a big step forward from Zestiria and Berseria, it still needs some work to be perfect tough. The last part of the game felt a bit rushed, especially the final battle, the plot twist wasn't really needed after all the hours of playing! I felt it as very unnecessary. Hope they'll keep on improving in the next Tales of, especially in giving the world a bit more life or depth.. Good, not great. It's just fine. Just an average jrpg with good graphic...... quite fun in the beginning, but gets pretty repetitive at the end. Still, most fun i've had playing tales series since Vesperia. This game was almost the perfect Tales of game. I absolutely love exploring the beautiful landscapes, dungeons and the story was fantastic and easy to follow. The character designs and interactions were top notch as well. Namco spared no expense in these departments, especially for a tales game. However, this game is a little frustrating for me... 1. It should have included the option to play as a 2-player local co-op... most if not all Tales of games had local co-op and I would have loved to play this with a friend. 2. Too much particle/flashy effects, snappy camera cuts and damage numbers cluttering up the screen when you have a full party in combat. The game is fine with just Alphen and Shionne, but when you recruit your 3rd and 4th character (plus reserve characters) the battle screen looks like a crappy version of Jackson Pollock painting or visual vomit. Combine that with the non-stop screaming and yelling each character does over each ****'s not art it's a headache. Plus, there is no option to turn off the battle cries without completely muting the voiceovers. Ughhh. This could have been the best tales game, but that honor still goes to Symphonia and Vesperia in my opinion.. This was my first tales of game - loved it so much. The amount of care and love that went into this game is astonishing. The combat is also easily accessible but rewards mastery similar to franchises like Devil May Cry.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I enjoyed the game immensely. I really liked the gameplay (especially the combat) as well as of course the graphics. The story wasn't a masterpiece by any means, but I greatly enjoyed it nonetheless, and the characters really shine in this game (especially the character dynamics). This game tried to do something different with the classic Tales formula (which I also liked, given that I love the classic games like Tales of Vesperia and Tales of the Abyss, as well as liked the more modern entries like Tales of Xillia and Tales of Bersaria) and I think it overall succeeded. The game overall was an incredible experience from start to finish, and I have hopes that they can continue to improve upon this strong basis in the future (whether that be building upon this good new framework they established with this game, or going back to a more traditional style but incorporating several of the good aspects from this game). As long as one plays this game with a mindset open to an Tales experience that tries something new, I think there is a lot to enjoy from this one. I highly recommend this game.. No thanks. I bought the game due to the good reviews. However, the game really disappoints. The plot is so predictable and the skits are especially annoying. Why can't they just make them into cut scenes? I feel the developers are just being lazy and it feels weird for gamers to stare at some static slides and listen to the unimportant dialogues. The only thing I like about the game is the combat but overall it was a total waste of time.. I hadn't played any Tales game before this and just bought this game because I liked the demo, so I went completely in the dark of what to expect from the series. And I have to say I love Tales of Arise. The characters are truly unforgettable. Everyone has a very well done design to his personality and the interactions between them has huge depth. The story in itself is nothing special by my opinion, but combining with the development of each characters it become truly amazing. The art style and soundtrack are outstanding as well. Let's talk about the combat. Maybe slow at start, but later on you get one of the best Action RPG combat system to date. It feels like hack and slash but keeps every aspect of RPG. Truly great combination. Also, the lengh of the game is exactly as it should. Overall, the excellent presentation of characters and the fantastic combat make this game a masterpiece. Highly recommend it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Combat was fun. I didn't care too much for the story or dialogue, but I don't go out of my way to platinum too many games. This one I did. I was looking forward to a new ""Tales of"" game. I finished the game 100% and completed every achievement. Here's a more detailed scoring: Combat and Gameplay: 8/10 Story: 4/10 Music: 7/10 Graphics: 8/10 World and Level design: 6/10 Combat is good and If you get the hang of it you can do some fun combos and absolutely destroy enemies. I personally had more fun controlling Rinwell in combat. Controlling other Characters in combat is an improvement compared to previous ""Tales of"" games. I think this game offers a way to have fun in combat with every character and the solo challenges that you can do were fun. The Story was mediocre and for me a bit bland. Sometimes the interactions between characters in Skits and throughout the Story felt weird and out of place, sometimes even pretty cringe and nonsensical. I didn't like the direction towards the end of the game and how the plot evolved. I think the Story is the weakest part of this game which is sad since previous ""Tales of"" games usually had pretty enjoyable stories. The Music is okay. Can't say much now months after I played the game but I don't remember any song so it's only a 7/10. Graphics are a good step forward from previous ""Tales of"" games. Since this is not a fully next-gen game I'm looking forward to what they can do in the next game. Since I played on PS5 I had no performance issues. While the design of the world looks great this game is sadly still stuck in the PS2 era of level design. You can see a wide open area of the world but you are restricted to corridors. I sincerely hope the next ""tales of"" game doesn't do this.. Great game, -2 for one of the most idiotic mechanics in gaming (CP), another -1 due to some ridiculously stupid bosses (Ganabelt, Efreet etc) and another -1 due to the impossibility of using the mystic arts with Rinwell.. I had to force myself to finish it, it took me two months of stalling because every time I load the save and start playing I get annoyed with their voices, the dialogue is atrocious! (I thought Xenoblade 3 had the worst dialogue until I played Arise). Too linear, too little eneme variety, sometimes too inconvenience. The premise is good but the execution is terrible, 5/10.. To say I’m addicted to this game is an understatement. The gameplay is glorious, there’s so many layers and choices. Graphically it’s beautiful, both in environments and character design. The amount of content available is plentiful. I’ve never been a huge lover of JRPGs but this game has broke that trend.. This wasn't the first time I played a Tales game, however, I wasn't hooked on any of the other games. But, Tales of Arise is a completely different beast! Seriously, this game is amazing, it has an incredible story, with very touching moments and with very nice characters! It has many twists and I was completely hooked from beginning to end! The gameplay is superb, you can control every character, and create your party before battles. Each character has completely different movements and feels very different to play with. The fights can be very challenging but also fair, you don't need to grind for anything, just play the story and some of the side stories, and done, you are always at a great level for the challenges of the game. The game is very long, even more so if you play it to its fullest, there are many locations, many side quests, and the story itself isn't very short. So if you love long experiences and amazing gameplays, you have to play this masterpiece.. Wonderful game. I'm surprised by the mechanics of the game. I've always liked Final Fantasy RPG games and decided to try Tales of Arise. fantastic and epic. I summarize the game as magnificent.. Really ambitious game which for the most part delivers. The first couple of ""chapters"" in the game are amazing a 10/10. I think that the storytelling runs into some bumps as you get further into the game The game still ended up being a joy to play and I really felt pushed to finish the game in a way I haven't felt in awhile. This truly was one of the best rpgs I have played. The combat is really good, there are plenty of little things to play around with like stats, abilities, equipment, cooking, fishing, plenty of side quests. The visuals are really nice. The music is very good. Character development is pretty well done. The characters themselves are amazing design and personality. If you have been looking for a new rpg to play and have a good amount of time on your hands, you should really consider Tales of arise. IMO this is the best tales game in the series.. Good jrpg but last third is just filler, with boring detailed story. I remember that Vesperia vas also long and boring at some point. So I rushed trough game and it was pretty difficult even on very easy in 32hrs.... Firstly, unlike reviews saying this is for fans of the tales series, I call bull. I have tried and failed to get into anything previously. Besaria, vesperia, never touched the sides. I love ajrpg, but never could. This, this is right up there with YsViii. Slow starter, trickles a decent rpg system. Combat is smooth, intricate and a decent challenge at higher levels. Music is fully orchestrated, all main characters have a decent backstory, full if twists. The graphics although still behind triple A are the next level for JRPG. Pop in let's it down a bit but doesn't detract. The game takes to the first boss to get truly hooked, but it has that special **** ability to hook you in. Its one you keep playing til end game at least. Worth every penny on ps5 and definitely best of the bunch of elysium and scarlet nexus.. Loved it! Not my favorite tales game but still pretty good! If you’re a fan of action games or RPG games with long drawn out stories and colorful dramatic characters you’ll love this game!. Having OKkish characters with voice acting slightly better than that in regular anime , a story line which seemed as if 'twas made by 2 drunk men in jail with nothing better to do, unbalanced soundtrack ( most of them are boring, the only epic one is made stale by being played again and again in almost every 2nd fight), a battle system which reminds you of good ol' days with PS2 and God Hand (but that also gets stale inevitably, with overrepititive fights against same 4 enemies with almost no weakness and giant health pools, being repeated again and again in the end), Tales of Arise was overall a mixed experience. With that being said it is the first and the last Tales game I will ever pick up. Due to it's satisfactory combat the game is enjoyable, at least for 40 hrs, till the 2nd half of the game starts, after that you can throw the disc in a trash can, piss on it and set it on fire.. The game is fun. The plot is good. However, I am quite sad that it has no multiplayer. For me, that almost was deal breaker and kept me from buying it for so long. I will give it a good rating but I hope you chose to give your next game multiplayer. As I think your your tales games will just be another JRPG on the market at that point. With nothing that sets it aside form the rest.. I never was really into the Tales of series, I just got the game because I needed something new to play, when I started playing it was different from what I'm used to. I was so intrigued to continue playing Tales of Arise because of the fact it was/is good. That is an understatement, this game is by far one of the most emotional games I have ever played, this is a game that is filled with romance between all characters, and this is a tearjerker which I like, towards the end was very emotional. This is by far again on of the best games I enjoyed playing. I am looking forward to the next tales of if it happens.. I kinda loved this game. The art and graphics are beautiful. I like the characters and story though the story kinda got a bit worse in the last third of the game. I loved the ending. I really connected with the characters and their relationships. The gameplay was fun enough but nothing special. I can't really decide if i want to give it a 9 or a 10. But for now i'll leave it at a 9.. A fantastic adventure,I love this ending. Characters 10/10 Story 8/10 Graphics 10/10 Soundtrack 10/10 Gameplay 9/10. You can feel that this game was made by a team of interns with very low budget. Plot holes down right and center, 10 enemies re-skined 15 times, 10 weapons re-skined 15 times, 10 costumes re-skined 15 times, you get the idea, even boss enemies re-used. They even didn't bother making the ending in 3d, they just put the cheap 15 fps anime cutscene (PS5 version haha). Many times there are no transition between the levels, just the black screen. I wanted to rate this higher since I did finish the game, but they did not even include very limitted co-op which we used to have, but don't believe this is because of the new ""unique"" and ""dynamic"" combat system, it was just cut to save money just like everything else. Absolute garbage. This is the worst, dumb, simplistic and bland story I've ever played in an rpg, only the last quarter gets kinda interesting. I really forced myself to play it. Repetitive combat with tons of enemies everywhere, and once you get the full party, you realize how shallow, messy and repetitive combat is. Doing the same strategy over and over, seeing the same combat cutscenes for 50 hours. Characters speaking too much nonsense dialogue during the time you're not fighting. Simple and poor side quest design which, which in fact are merely fetch quests. Poor and lifeless cities. Rushed and disappointing ending. This has been my first Tales experience and didn't quite enjoyed it at all. Will play others anyway, can't judge an entire saga by one bad game. As a huge fan of Tales Of games, this was just awful. The characters are what really carry these games usually but all of these fools are just so painfully boring. Honestly can't think of anything to grab onto to enjoy any of these characters, they feel like tropes and nothing else. Like puppets playing a part rather then actually characters to relate to. Tropes also extends out to the painfully generic plot and step by step type delivery. It leaves very little room to wonder where the plots going to go when it constantly reminds you the steps needed to get there. Only fun thing about this was the combat. It was nice and flashy. Combats hard to enjoy though when that's really all there is to this game. Tales of Berseria absolutely moved me, this game moved me to turn off my Ps5 after generic plot line #187 popped up.. What an amazing surprise ****! I never expected it to be so dammm good. 10 out of 10. It starts getting boring and repetitive after three countries. But I really like the graphics and combat overall.. Game starts out promising but then the story gets kinda weak and drags on. Combat is fun enough to plow through over half but towards the end I was done, combat very repetitive. Side quests and intermittent quests all extremely repetitive. I could bring myself to finish the game and pretty sure I was about 90% through. Lost interest in story and gameplay mechanics.. Mediocre videogame. Really repetitive and with an uninteresting plot. I rate the game 6 since it has a good graphic and a nice setting (albeit very generic), there is a lot to do, to read and a lot of activities to carry out. Anyway, the rating cannot be more than this because it also has some serious flaws. Combat is average, it looks cool and is fun to control the characters and kills enemies... but it has no depth at all and is very repetitive. When your characters grow they just become stronger and new abilities don't change the way you use them or add anything interesting. Enemies are HP sponges, it's not fun to fight a wolf for 5 minutes, even less when it's the 10th wolf of the area. Story is ridicolous. So much plot holes and cliche. The setting is a planet that has been invaded by an advanced alien civilization; they enslaved everyone and divided the planet into 5 reigns. In the first few hours of the game you go from being a slave to liberate 1/5 of the world by simply entering the ""king"" room and killing him. After you kill him every other invader simply goes away despite them being there for 300 years and being technologically on another level compared to those who rebelled. You repeat this other 4 times and free the whole world. The story becomes very convoluted by the end but it's not really well explained and remains very disappointing. Dialogues are boring and they happen too often and are too long, characters lack personality and aren't really interesting. Subquests are boring and mostly consist of ""kill this special enemy with 10000000000HP"", or just fetch this item. I didn't play any other ""Tales of..."" game so if you're into the serie you probably know what you're getting into, but I don't recommend this game to anyone that isn't a super fan of anime and JRPGs with real time combat. And even in that case, you could dislike the game.. The game was a blast to play but with a few caveats. Definitely one of the harder games I played this year. Pros 1. The graphics look splendid 2. Combat is amazing 3. Huge load of cutscenes but they never overstay their welcome 4. Weapon and costume design is marvellous Cons 1. Side quests are boring 2. Lip syncing issues 3. Weak story Overall a memorable 50-60 hours. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is an enormous disappointment and I'm baffled at its positive reviews. I feel compelled to at least warn others as to what they are getting if you waste money on this. This is essentially a linear walking simulator in which you spend just as much time reading dialog ue and being interrupted by a nine style party dialog ue scenes as you do walking and engaging in the boring combat. The game chose to make armor sets and costumes two different thing to compell microtransactions as well as be lazy and not have to have a different design for each armor you equip. The game also compels microtransactions by making even grinding to level up extremely tedious. To call this game an open world rpg is just an outright lie. All progression is locked behind linear progression of the story in terms of the skill trees. It will become quite clear early on just how far from an rpg or even an action adventure game this is. It may look pretty but it plays like a mediocre game from the early 99s It's merely a playable movie of a very generic, extremely repetitive and half baked anime. If that's your thing have fun.. Tales of Arise is a fantastic JRPG with fun gameplay, interesting story and fun characters. Coming to the franchise as a newbie and wanted to give this a try as a big fan of JRPGs. The story is interesting and very anime, but in a good way! The anime tropes of a main character with a mysterious background is done decently and the overall journey the characters go through was compelling. The manga style cutscenes were a welcome change for me as well. Gameplay and combat was quite fun. Combat has so many options and it was satisfying to pull off cool combos and air juggles. It reminds me of Devil May Cry but not as deep. The special moves with other party members were a spectacle but may get a little repetitive towards the end for some people. Additionally, you can play as the other party members, which is great for varying play styles and variety in general. Special shoutout to the boss battles too, most of them were grand, unique and a great challenge. The main downsides I think were the side quests and enemy type variety. Most side quests I found to be repetitive fetch quests like “kill x amount of enemies in this particular area”. It would’ve been great if the side quests weren’t as repetitive. The enemy variety were not great and were mostly the same in every region in the game just reskinned into a different colour to suit the scenery/climate of the region. All in all, it’s a great JRPG, I would recommend it, and it has been out for a while so you could probably find it for a great price.. Amazing game! First time trying a Tales game, and it did not disapoint. Absolutly beutiful design, and combat system. The dialog is a bit on the childish side for me, but the the game it self is very good.. very good action JRPG with anime style action scenes. ver","""Tales of Arise"" is one of the best entries in the series, delivering a memorable experience . the game excels in its beautiful world design and fluid combat system . pacing issues and repetitive side quests slightly detract from the overall experience ."
816.Spelunky 2,"This game had the potential to provide a rewarding, challenging and fun experience. Instead it loves throwing stun locks and one shot kills in your face. Punishing mechanics aren't necessarily a flaw, but the way they've been implemented here make the experience very frustrating. Some of the traps are also quite cheap, since some of them can trigger when they aren't fully on screen. The randomness is something that makes this game very unique even amongst other rogue-likes. Sometimes it results in you getting powerful items early on, other times it sends off screen objects hurdling towards you through no fault of your own. The game definitely needed a bit more time in the oven to iron out any balancing issues. But based on what the developers have said, it seems like they don't see cheap deaths as problem. Its just ""a part of the game"". If there's one thing that's clear, the game really doesn't respect or care about your time. The best roguelike you can play. It's never boring despite so many wasted hours, it's nice to listen to a podcast or music and drink good coffee while playing. You can also put challenges for yourself and try to beat them. It's a very personal game, and I liked playing it a lot!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Genuinely a step up from the previous game. More items, more enemies and more ways to die. I like the idea of having two different paths at the end of a world to choose from. I didn't play the game as much as the first one but I certainly appreciated it.. Spelunky 2 took everything that spelunky 1 did right and amplified it by 10, Spelunky 2 stomps the first game to the ground. I love this game, i hate it but i love it. Improved from og spelunky which was already a banger. Still haven't got past world 2 but I love this game. Game would be an easy 9 if getting combo'd to death outside your control didn't happen so much. The software lacks any save, checkpoint or level codes (as were implemented on 1980s NES games that lacked the technology to store saves) as such you basically have to replay the same first few levels endlessly. I suspect the designers put some effort into the later levels but decided they do not want players to ever see them. This design is the equivalent of taking the script for ""A Few Good Men"" and instead making 19 seasons of NCIS and airing them in no particular order. Many TV viewers are happy to watch the same story over and over but they would not be happy if they went to a movie theatre and were shown a random sampling of NCIS episodes until they walked out. Even Mega Man (released in 1987) allowed you to replay levels until you turned your system off, by Mega Man 2 codes were provided to restore progress. Mega Man has released many sequels and will continue to be enjoyed long after Spelunky is forgotten. The online multiplayer has terrible latency, I assume this was done on purpose to make the game more difficult for the bizarre fans of this ""genre"". The fans of this software certainly value feeling elite very highly and they would be very susceptible to a cult. This software contains interesting pieces that could have been used to make a game however the developers instead have made a challenge which could have been one possible game mode.. Nice sequel to nice roguelike old school platformer. Visuals are good, sounds are good, gameplay are top. Music from first area are highly infective and your roommates will hate you for that tunes! For me sequel became more harder than original. It took 6 months to get first finish. And still have many hidden quests. Online sessions delivers more fun than single run, but random teammates usually are crazy mad, and are too close to ruin all party. And don't forget main rule, spelunker: never step too fast!. 300 hours in and I'm sure I will be playing this game for the rest of my life. Superior to HD in every way except the music IMO but I turned that off in both games fairly early on. There are so many secrets to be found and end game content to keep even the best players engaged for 100+ hours. Yes, it's harder than HD. No, that's not a bad thing. Early on I felt the game was unfair sometimes but with experience I have come to blame myself for the vast majority of my deaths. Derek Yu and Blitworks have been pushing out updates since lauch to make it the best possible experience. A must play for HD fans and anyone who enjoys difficult games. A masterpiece, in my opinion.. As fan of retro style games this one is a gem. Easy to pick up and put down without needing to invest tons of time into it. Its a rouge-like where every run is a new discovery. Very difficult but very rewarding when you get further then before. Overall worth a full price purchase on any platform.. Spelunky 2 is the perfect metaphor for life. Keep on digging, be persistent, stay vigilant, and you'll be rewarded. There are deep truths embedded within. It just so happens to be an amazing game too. Keep spelunking people, don't give up. I'm an not a hardcore gamer, that's true but i would really like to love Spelunky 2. It reminds me of Ricky Dangerous back the old days of Amiga. Anyway, it is very difficult and it annoys me the fact that you cannot save your progress and you have to go back to the start even you somehow reached 2nd, 3rd stage or further in the game. You will want eventually to use hacks to go on..... A shining example of how a sequel can improve on the original in every possible way. With its silky smooth controls, charming visuals and music, endless secrets & discoveries and rewarding, skill-based gameplay, Spelunky 2 is a true delight. Probably the best rogue-like platformer ever made.. A perfectsequel to an already perfect original. Bigger, faster, more colourful, more imaginative, more stylish and MUCH more difficult than the original in every conceivable way. Even after more than 15,000 playthroughs of the original (killing King Yama more than 200 times in the process), I still feel like a complete Spelunky noob once again. And despite my high early death count, I'm absolutely loving it. Spelunky 2 is a masterpiece; proof that Derek Yu's almost impossible quest to improve upon the original more than justified the extended delays to the game's highly-anticipated launch. Proceed with extreme caution though - as good as this game ultimately is, it will definitely frustrate the less-than-hardcore gamers out there. Spelunky 2 will undoubtedly be responsible for damage to hundreds of PS4 controllers (and potentially a few TVs too). A god amongst roguelikes platformers, and the perfect swan song for the PS4. MIss it at your peril.. It's good, certainly, but the first area is very similar to Spelunky, except much more difficult. This makes the early game feel redundant and exhausting. I think I played the original Spelunky too much to really enjoy this. I'll change this review if I make it to the later areas, but frankly I don't think I ever will.. A good sequel, but of course it doesn't reinvent anything. I hold the first Spelunky as one of the best games that I've played and anyone that enjoyed the first game will most definitely find a liking to Spelunky 2. I must admit that I am far from having finished the game yet, but have probably died 200 or 300 times already, with that being said there are a lot of things I have not explored yet. There are some new features and fun things going on and there is only one major flaw I can come to think of: When you get injured/hurt the stun sequence is far too long and since you don't have any invicibility frames a single accident far to often results in a quite unfair perma death, even if you had as much as 6 or 7 HP. Hopefully this will be patched.. I played the original quite a lot back in the day so it's good to see it get a sequel. I'd say it's almost perfect. To me, this is one of the few games where I think that the difficulty makes it more fun. I would definitely recommend it to beginners and veteran players.. Addictive game loop that is plauged with annoying quirks, rng and insane difficulty. Why is there no way to adjust the difficulty level? If you really wanted to ""welcome newcomers"", this would have been the first thing to include already in the design phase. Feels like a lazy decision to not have. This game also has lots of annoying quirks, things that surprise you - usually in a bad way. Like how the whip hits things behind you as well. Or how you can drop what you are holding if your standing close to an edge. Im sure some will call it ""attention to details"", but this - and other similar things - just makes the game feel inconsistent and weird. The core game loop is great, but it is sorely missing a way to adjust the difficulty. This drags the score down a lot for me. Something that also needs to be brought up is the RNG. The RNG is horrible in this game, sometimes giving you sections of the game where you are doomed to die no matter what you do. Another thing is the limited visibility, where you drop down only to have something off screen jump at you when you land causing you to die immediately. This is clearly the result of RNG generated levels - no sane level designer would build it in this way. RNG should more be an option for an extension when you are done with the game, not as a replacement for proper level design. Combine this with save points that are extremely far in between and your in for an infuriating time. Such a shame - a great opportunity missed is kind of what this game is. First off, I love the original Spelunky. I spent a lot of time with that game and it is a true classic to me. Having said that I've soured on Spelunky 2. The game itself is a rouglike but there are some repeating elements that happen on every run (like fighting a boss on the 4th level). The problem is the gameplay loop results in doing the same exact tasks followed rng/randomgess making the player do the same tasks, encounter something new and die, and then spend time doing the same tasks again to try to progress. The complexity of making it to the secret area is more frustrating than fun. The liquid dynamics look great but can create some levels that seem a little unfair. Oh and a big thing is taming animals takes too much time. So runs can also feel like they are wasting time followed by a death that's hard to predict.. It's too complicated and difficult. The story is also hard to understand.. It's a real game (like Dark Souls, and Bloodborne, Breath of the Wild, and Gran Turismo Sport), it's a rewarding challenge, but also a piece of astonishing craftsmanship. A marble.. Spelunky 2 is a great, challenging game that will dazzle both veterans and newcomers alike.. Easily the best platformer ever, the original had a great concept but levels felt empty and weren't very detailed or complex, they were clearly the result of an algorithm. Furthermore the game felt very barebones and it was lacking when it comes to content, however the sequel improves so much on the formula of the original that these issues are non existent in this game. Levels feel designed and man made, they don't feel like the result of an algorithm even though they are, this is extremely impressive and thanks to this there are an infinite amount of unique and fun levels. Furthermore the game is also extremely varied and has a huge amount of content, it switches biome/world every 4 levels and has more of them than the original, there is also a huge amount of enemy types so you definitely wont get bored. The game is also challenging, like old school platformers which is a definite plus in my book. It has a very nice progression system too. Its mechanics are very well made and very polished. Furthermore the controls are very tight and responsive. The art style is great, much better than the originals imo. This game is perfect. The price is too cheap for what you get. The original was a 7/10 at best, this one is a definite 10/10.. Just fantastic. Feels like the first but with even tighter controls, sharper graphics and amazing sound. More danger, more companions to find and tons of secrets to discover. If you liked the first game, you will love this even more, WOW.. Utterly beautiful in the classiest way and impeccable game design to the minutest detail by Derek Yu. The game to top in the next decade.. Just what the doctor ordered. I'm only about 5 hours into it, but I'm having a blast. I loved the first one and I think they changed it just enough to make everything feel fresh and dangerous again while still retaining everything that really made it shine.","this game had the potential to provide a rewarding, challenging and fun experience . but the way they've been implemented here make the experience very frustrating . the randomness is something that makes this game very unique even amongst other rogue-likes ."
817.Hi-Fi Rush,"I'll only talk about the game itself, as I know Bethesda and Microsoft have had their share of run-ins with the public regarding the closure of the studio behing Hi-Fi Rush (thankfully saved since Microsoft's announcement). What an authentic gem, a pleasure to play and an riveting experience from start to finish. Being a rhythm-based platformer/Hack and slash with boss fights, music is proeminent and therefore very important, and the game didn't miss. The soundtrack is an absolute pleasure to listen to while running/sliding and fighting across the levels. The graphic design of the game is stunning to me, colourful and visually vibrant, without being too full or blinding. Gameplay is extremely solid, based on combos that you make hitting your buttons on beat, and can be rewarding and satisfying when you get the gist of it. Despite being a solo adventure, the companions you have throughout make it very alive and dynamic, just like the writing which is top notch. It never feels tedious or boring, however I'd take a point off for some fights in which I felt like the difficulty was a bit artificially high (mainly the last two bosses, and some of the ""bigger"" base enemies. It's a great addition to the Game Pass, and a must play.. If Elden Ring and Geometry Dash had a love child, this would be it. With a decent helping of wacky slapstick humor, this game manages to keep a good story, and good rhythm, which keeps players coming back for more. With new combos to learn all the time, it keeps combat fresh and keeps the game open for a second or third playthrough of the game. Only criticism is that at times it can get a bit repetative but thats often shortly changed by the addition of a new ability, companion or unique bossfight.. Not since Guitar Hero and Co. have I had this much fun dealing with rhythms as the main protagonist. What the Tango Gameworks team has created here goes far beyond the correct timing of tones. Wrapped in a wonderfully written story with lovable characters and a wonderful production, Hi-Fi Rush is also an absolute hit on the PlayStation 5. The fair price and the controls, which are excellently optimized for the features of the DualSense, more than adequately console the fact that Sony fans had to wait over a year for the release. If you haven't played the game on PC and XBOX Series X|S yet, you can now do so without hesitation.. Hi-Fi Rush delivers an incredibly fun experience with its rhythmic combat that challenges players to time their attacks perfectly. For a smoother playthrough, I recommend trying easy mode. The dialogue is sharp, and the story creates a solid bond with the characters. The game also cleverly shifts into a 3D platformer in key areas, adding variety as players navigate left and right. Overall, it’s a fresh and engaging ride!. The combat with the rhythm is just something incredibly done in this game, the bosses are really good to face against and it’s soundtrack just rocks!. Everything about this game is perfect Graphics the art style the sound track the gameplay the characters are so lovable and funny the story telling the bosses the rythme thing ..... Deserves a good sequel. Great, with soul and fun characters but so dissapointing gameplay. The story, characters, and art is its strength. Story is good, its a kind of simple adventure but fun. Characters are memorable well designed, has good acting and incredibly fun to see, and that goes for protagonists and villains and even NPC's have charm. Everyone is filled with personality and uniqueness. The finale is satisfying, not too special but good. The only character that i can complain is Macaroon partner, way too predictable cliche and kind of like a forced comic relief, like when the hero says everything good to the team but he says to that one member: You, just be you. Art style and the visual design of levels are incredible, with varied colors, places, themes and OST that provides a good change of pace and are all incredibly well done, its a feast for your eyes and music to your soul. Unfortunately i think thats like the only good thing. Gameplay is SO SO dissapointing and underwhelming. No challenge in platforming and a lot of quirks in it. No particularly special feature no nothing. Jump is so quirky in a game that seems to distribute into 50/50 its combat and platforming, and jump is way too essential for it to just feel bad, they should have gone for a different one outside of combat and the default in combat. Everything is too easy in that aspect and there is nothing especial. Combat is decent and avobe average at best. You have a lot of combo moves but you have limited use on each one, you can barely chain stuff, there is like 2 satisfying chains and cancels to pull of but its so linear and simple in an action focused game. Parry is decent enough and rythm parries are very satisfying and good but thats it. Assists had incredible potential but ended up being too simple and straightforward a lot of times. Bosses are good, they provide a good change of pace from all the other combat, they are unique, fun with good ideas behind which were well executed. My last dissapointment. For a game so centered about music i dont think i can recall a single OST melody. Most were dissapointing and very unsoulful and generic. Bosses themes were good for its battles, i can recall mimosa theme being good enough to listen outside the game but outside of her nothing that will stick with you till the end (but as i said, really good in their context) Hi fi rush is very decent and well worth trough gamepass, gameplay i can only say that could be good for action games virgins but it is very underwhelming. Story Art and Characters in the other hand, are very good.. Hi-Fi Rush looks superb (art style + japanise vibe) but it has some of the worst quick time events that I ever come across. Battle is good, very forgiving for players that don't fallow rhythm on right dificulty level and story is grate. So I'm very happy with that part. But the QTEs are just annoying. Probably I'm terrible at it but it just stop fun for me. Bit frustrating not so much but still are seqences with blocking lasers. Long story short I didn't finish the game. I quit plaing after 3-4h. Maybe I wil give the game other change in the futer. My conclusion is that game is mix of greate story, good gamplaey and terrible QTEs.. This game is one of the best combat-rhythm game... even though it's the only one, but it's set the standard HIGH.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fun and great game. Good length for the main quest and plenty do after finishing it.. As of writing this it's not long since Tango Gameworks were closed which broke my heart as well as so many others. This game was my absolute GOTY last year and no game ever came close. It's by far one of the most polished games I've played. I didn't encounter a single bug. It's an absolute blast as it has everything. The art style perfectly compliments how much of a pop culture frenzy this game is. The music is spot on for every encounter and you never want the encounter to end so you can just keep kicking a** to the music. The combat itself it very satisfying and gets more satisfying as you unlock combos and learn those combos to create chains. It truly feels like you're the one swinging that guitar. This game is an absolute 10/10. I've had over a year to think of faults and I can't. It's an Excellent game. I just want more. Please give the people more. If you have Game Pass just download or stream it and play it. Atleast try it. I wasn't sure at first and was just intrigued by the concept and had never played anything like it. I played via Game Pass but I will be purchasing the physical edition when it releases. It is worth every single penny if you don't have Game Pass. This game is true videogame art in every way.. In an era where studios only copy Fromsoftware formula, here comes Hi-Fi Rush to remind everyone why Hack'n Slash are way more fun to play when it's done right. This is a must play.. I'd give this game a 7.5, but I can definitely understand why people give this a 9 or a 10. I think the exploration is fun, the graphics are great, and the aesthetic is really cool. However, what I have come to realize is that I personally just don't like rhythm games all that much. If rhythm games are you're thing, I can easily see this being a 10/10 game. I enjoyed the rhythm mechanic during most fights, but the sections where I had to follow button prompts on screen to press a big button and open up a new path were just tedious and took me out of the fun. I also hated when the game gated me off and made me match some button combo to the beat to parry lasers from flying robots. These moments when the game forces you to do these things just felt so annoying and disruptive. I got to chapter 6 which I think is about half way and I had to put the game down because I was annoyed. Maybe I'll come back to it later if my backlog is empty.. A niche style game I wish there were more of. Details that were put into making this game, make it feel rewarding when finishing.. Fantastic game, easily one of Microsofts best games. Think Microsoft laid a very good foundation here for a real system seller in the future.. RIP Tango and FU MS! This game and the studio MS closed due to corporate greed (and not enough awards;-) is awesome!. Perfect. Just a masterpiece in all aspects and internal metrics. Tango forever. Tango Gameworks is awesome. Xbox is garbage. This game is awesome. Hopefully Xbox goes out of business for their dumb decisions.. The game has its shortcomings, but which game doesn't? The point is, if you haven't played yet. You should! It is THAT good!. I removed my credit card from my xbox so I don't accidentally give Microsoft any more money after their egregious greed and incompetence This tells me xbox is not interested in making good games, only live service garbage which I am not interested in. If hi fi rush was not enough then nothing is safe. They don't just want lots of money, they want ALL the money, and they will do ANYTHING to get it. F xbox F xbox F xbox F xbox F xbox F xbox F xbox F xbox F xbox F xbox F xbox F live service F pathological greed. Awesome gam, awesome developers, poor judgment from Microsoft! They don't deserve you. Excellent video game really amazing and enjoyable and really recommend to play. Very well made game. Vibrant, right controls that are forgiving and with enough challenges to keep me interested. Playful, light and still engaging! A must buy or download if you have GamePass.. It's a game that's been unnecessarily hyped for lack of good titles on the launch platform. For kids and casual gamers.. The game is extremely good! Best game published by Bethesda imo. It’s a shame that incompetent management from Microsoft decided to close Tango Gameworks. Shame on you Xbox ending game like that We need hi-fi rush 2 as soon as possible. One of the best gamesI'veever played andIwent in with super low expectations.What are you doingMicrosoft?Reconsider please. This game came out of nowhere. I wasn’t sure if I was going to like it but it **** me in. It’s absolutely ridiculous that Microsoft shut down the studio.. Fantastic Game, Original, Fun, Polished. Microsoft / Xbox shame on your for killing one of the best games I have played since getting my Xbox Series X!. Hi Fi Rush redefines the rhythm-based combat genre with its innovative gameplay mechanics. Set in a mesmerizing world where every action is synchronized to the beat, the game offers players an electrifying experience like no other. With seamless integration of rhythmic elements into combat, Hi Fi Rush delivers a challenging yet exhilarating gameplay experience that demands precision and **** talented developers behind Hi Fi Rush deserve immense praise for their dedication and creativity. Their passion for gaming is evident in every aspect of the game, from its intricate level design to its captivating audiovisuals. It would be foolish for any company to overlook the studio responsible for such a groundbreaking and soul-fulfilling **** Fi Rush is more than just a game – it’s a testament to the power of creativity and innovation in the gaming industry. With its masterful execution and immersive gameplay, it sets a new standard for interactive entertainment. Here’s to hoping for many more unforgettable adventures from this exceptional team.. The Game Is Increíble,Understand and creat a new style of gameplay introduces amazing enemies wich challenge you. Fun and creative gameplay. I could not stop smiling while playing, so fun and imaginative, it looks and feels like nothing else in the industry. Yet Microsoft pay them back by closing them. This would have been an awesome franchise! Tv show, more games movies it could have been great!. It's great in almost everyway. Rehirethe devs!!!! Art style is amazing and humor works well.. The Game Is Increíble,Understand and creat a new style of gameplay introduces amazing enemies wich challenge you. Fun and creative gameplay. Bring back the studio! There was no reason to close it! Or take over the employees and mix them with existing Xbox studios. I don't care how you do it, but do something!. amazing game! Why Microsoft had to close Tango Gameworks? They have done amazing games like The Evil Within, Ghostwire Tokyo and Hi-Fi Rush. I knew that bad things 'd happen if microsoft bought Bethesda. Xboxer since the first console, today very angry with the company and Phil Spencer Very great game. One of the best games I have ever played. From start to finish you’re stuck to your screen. The first day I got it I played at least like 8 hours. I’ve only done that with a handful of games. This one’s one of them.. A great game that no one was expecting and that surprised us all by being one of the most unique games of this generation, sad to see xbox not caring about the game or the studio as much as the fans do, but no matter what they do it doesnt take away from the fact that this is an amazing game that deserves all the glory it gets.. A phenomenal soundtrack that is energising & deeply embedded into the gameplay which elevates the whole experience into something unique & amazing that is guaranteed to be one of the best games of this this generation. ""Hi-Fi Rush is hands down one of the most exhilarating games I've ever played! From the moment I dove into its world of vibrant colors and pulsating beats, I was hooked. The gameplay is fast-paced, yet incredibly immersive, keeping me on the edge of my seat with every twist and turn.What truly sets Hi-Fi Rush apart is its seamless integration of music and gameplay. Each level feels like a journey through a symphony of sound, with every action perfectly synchronized to the beat. It's a sensory delight that keeps you coming back for **** beyond its addictive gameplay, Hi-Fi Rush offers something more profound. It's a reminder that in the midst of life's chaos, there's always beauty to be found – if you're willing to ****, if you're ready to embark on an audio adventure like no other, I highly recommend giving Hi-Fi Rush a try. You won't be disappointed.(And remember, sometimes the true magic lies in what you hear when you listen closely.)"". Amazingly good game. Combat is super fun, characters are delightful, and of course, outstanding soundtrack. Must play if you like action games.. Amazing Xbox owned game, wish it remained Xbox pc exclusive though, but oh well. The sequel gotta be Xbox pc exclusive to remind people that Microsoft owning the company. I love PS2 games and rhythm games but hi-fi rush is bad in every aspect besides visuals. Hi-Fi Rush is an absolute gem among Xbox’s game library. The gameplay consists of DMC game design where you go through levels that sprinkle in hack and slash combat. This game arguably perfected it by balancing in style and challenge that left me feeling welcomed in a way that 90% of AAA games have been struggling for a while to create these days. The only thing about the gameplay that wasn’t good was the in between combat segments where things like platforming tended to get boring and bland. Story is nothing to write home about given that it isn’t the games #1 priority, but for what it's worth things like the characters and world fit the games vision very well. Final thing I will note is the art style, which in simple terms is incredible. This game goes for an borderline comic book animation style and it manages to be cool to watch and fun to play through. In Conclusion, pick this game up. Was absolute fun on my first play through and I still look back on this game extremely fondly today.. The superb visual style, zany story and excellent music elevate the average gameplay. Perhaps just my own taste here but for myself I found the combat gameplay repetitive and frustrating with platform sections proving to be very poorly suited to this control scheme. The story, visual presentation and superb animations kept me coming back for more though.. A wonderful game with a unique atmosphere and musical accompaniment. I am very impressed and glad that the game has been released on a new platform. Huge respect to the creators of the game. Спасибо !. Great action rhythm packed game. Loved the humor, the gameplay how innovative it is absolutely smart platform game full of unforgettable moments. It delivers its simple story in a unique way. It just misses the variety of enemies, varied environmental design and missed opportunity to add playable characters. Great visual style and gameplay .The soundtrack Is great, very fun overall.. Great story, great combact, great ost.... why this wasn't nominate game of the year?. Behind gorgeous animations, music, art style and sound design lies a hack n slash game which is just... kinda average? Slow and some questionable design decisions here and there. And the reddit type humor is embarrassing. But its a good game for $30 I guess. Now on PS5, great news for enjoy a great game on a new platform and also check the content and gameplay. Hi-Fi Rush is one creative masterpiece to look at graphically. With game elements of timing into the music this is one hell of a ride.. Hi-Fi Rush presents a delightful blend of original gameplay mechanics and vibrant visuals. Although I haven't seen it through to the end, my experience has been thoroughly enjoyable, making it a solid choice for those looking for something fresh.. this game is fun enough to play for a few hours at a time but not for an extensive length of time. the story is enjoyable.. This is absolute perfection. A video game masterpiece. I love everything about it so much, really, thoroughly enjoyed this game! Thank you for it! It’s one of the best, and def one of my favorite video games of all time. There was so much love put into this.. epic.. I have found that over half of the reviews are made by PlayStation lovers so this is coming from a person who loves both consoles the game looks amazing, and I find myself stopping and being in awe of how beautiful It is not only that each fight makes you feel awesome it can get as bit hard as you need brutal timing but its still a fantastic and beautiful game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. is very funny and user friendly game, pure pleasure. on start im think that i cant fight with music, but later skill coming to me). So this game I started months ago, and decided to finally finish the game. After playing it, it's a solid rhythm game/slash, and more welcoming to people who don't play these types of games or really care for it. Performing combos and doing bonus damage or higher score by matching the rhythm of the beat of the song is done quite well. The game isn't too punishing other than a few instances (like performing a 20 something combo exactly right or you have to start it over again was quite annoying. The other few times were some of the boss battles can be a bit unclear what to do at first or do too much cheap damage). Pros: music, gameplay, art design, characters. I liked most of the songs they created for the game. The overall gameplay is solid. The art design is well done and very unique. The characters for the most part are likable (but there are times when they are annoying). Cons: Some of the character dialogue is a bit annoying. Mainly I found it annoying during boss battles *most notably during the battle against the one character that you have to only dodge/parry her attacks and if you mess up your sidekicks just get really annoying...* This leads into my next point that some of the boss battles are just unfair or too long. Most notably the battle I just talked about as that drags on way too much, and the 2nd last boss character his battles does unfair damage. It's a shame too because the character idea they nailed it with the jokes with the music to the character design. Last thing is the enemy variety, this did feel somewhat repetitive as there's only a few real different enemy types. This in turn really makes the fights mostly the same after awhile. I also noticed that you can make the game a bit more boring if you only rely a few combos and keep calling in your sidekicks in battle (even though it's effective). Overall, it's a game that has very solid gameplay that definitely carries it's writing and pacing, as the game can drag on at certain points of the game. And the story it's nothing great but does just enough to keep you interested.. Hi-Fi Rush is A masterpiece in every sense of the word Combat, enemies, gameplay ideas, stage design, boss fights, smooth gameplay, artistic direction, comic hero 10/10 _ must play. Hi-Fi Rush blends hack and slash/beat-em up combat, with 3D platforming, and rhythm game timing into a satisfying package. The game is very vibrant due to its cell-shaded look, harkening back to old school PS2/Xbox games, but the stylizing helps give it a unique look. Combat is a blast. The writing and characters are top notch, too, making comedic moments feel great. The soundtrack is fantastic. My only gripe is that the game is a bit on the shorter side, but it is replayable.. Another overrated game just because it’s an exclusive.Rhythm games are terrible.. Congratulations to Microsoft and the Xbox Team for finally releasing a game that isn't just another Forza, another Halo or some glorified early access POS like Sea of Thieves. This game is a perfect combination of music games and Devil may Cry like hack-n-slash games with a really funny story and a lovable cast of characters with some epic boss battles. The only real complaint I have about this game is that it's a bit short. It can easily take you 7-9 hours to beat this game.. The best shadow drop ever made, hifi rush mixed rhythmic hacknslash gameplay in a hilarious story with nostalgic psp graphics. Hi-Fi Rush is one of the best and most unique hack and slash games in recent times. It features a battle system where combos and rhythm based attacks are intertwined to give you a frantic yet deeply combat experience, that is easy to learn and complex to master. You will be chaining mid-air combos all while in sync with the awesome soundtrack and gorgeous, comic book-style visuals. The story can be kind of lackluster, but the gameplay speaks for itself.. Unparalleled fun, meaningful hack and slash action متعة لا مثيل لها معنى الهاك اند سلاش. Playing this game on x cloud was an horrible experience. Quick time events + imput lag = a nightmare ****. A shame, since I liked the art and the story seemed fun.. It´s my favorite game. perfect. the sounstrac, the desing. i always feel better plays this game.I thought this game woudn´t be so good. you need to play it.. Great game! Killer soundtrack, great look, innovative and deep gameplay. Absolute breath of fresh air.. Hi-Fi Rush was one of the first games released this year and it was one hell of a start to what would be one of the best years for gaming in a long time, the art style has a cartoony like feel and they managed to pull it off amazingly, the combat is really fun and feels responsive, and the soundtrack is amazing.. A masterpiece that came out of nowhere. Amazing soundtrack, amazing combat, amazing characters, fun story, an overall amazing journey. I really hope they make a sequel.. A game that should had been Nominated for game of the year. It is truly at gem. One of a kind. Musical blast. Tango games works understands how to make games.. Got this from game from gamepass and i do not regret playing this gem! Very underrated game with little to no marketing at release. This game is **** sick. What a masterpiece! It’s so good you don’t want to turn it off. my game of the year. Completely a unique game. Loved every beat of it.. Rhythm games aren’t my usual jam but this one is awesome. Really lots of fun. Well polished and looks great.. One of the best games of this generation which is impossible to believe is from this generation... a perfect game in all aspects. Fighting in the game amazing and adding rhythm to combat makes it even better I was surprised this actually worked and the story is good and has funny moments too that makes it even better. The rhythmic gameplay is unique, and we’re lucky that’s the case. The art-style and story were subpar and off putting.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Roquefort It's simply the best Boss Battle. 9/10 easily! This game is the best xbox game of the year in my opinion and an underrated game at that. This game gives me 2000s cartoon vibes with amazing rhythm bases gameplay. Rarely ever can a game make move a long to the rhythm. Hi Fi Rush has memorable characters, a solid story, and amazing gameplay. Truly an unsung game of 2023. Extremely fun game. It was an excellent surprise.. There's no doubt that this is an exceptional game where combat, music, and story seamlessly come together. The art style is quite impressive. I must commend the developers for doing a great job, especially considering it's an AA game.. Great game. Short and sweet with a cool art style and engaging combat. With a really good soundtrack.. Super fun game! A breath of fresh air in the midst of constant blockbusters, shooters, rpgs etc… I really missed playing games like these! Absolutely incredible art style, great characters and super cool visuals!. This game is for children, you won't find story, developing characters or deep mechanics in gameplay. Everything is simple and basicly on the acceptable level. Rhythm following is nice, but is not unique. Developers added several very nice bonuses like wallpapers, costumes, survival mode, it was very confusing that everything became available only after I had completed the game. I played and completed the game on the Hard difficulty.. This was a jem would say hands down one of the funnest Games Have played in some time. Not constantly try to get you to buy something. Just start up fun and can be a challenge, no bugs from my experience. I would put it on a must play list, it has the feel of an old game that was just made to be good. The games where there was no pressure to make a sequel (they may still do that) The story was okay but second to game play which was satisfying to master (not That did very well at that). The sound track was good as you would expect. The characters where fun an used well with in the game.. Platforming is amazing, fighting to the rythm of the music is awesome, the graphics and art style are very very very pleasing. The preformance, story, and witty humor never gets old. Overall its a very very enjoyable game, Only downfall being it can get a lil repetative but overall its an easy 9/10. My personal game of the year in one of the most stacked years in games. VeryFun game, with Fun mechanics,ALL progress is amazing. Tango Gameworks’ rhythm-based actioner is not only one of the most enjoyable games in years, but also one of the most stunningly beautiful, with fantastic music and beat-matching combat to boot. Hi-Fi Rush is, indeed, as its name suggests, a rush. TGG – 9 / 10 AUDIO 9/10 Fantastic music (both original and licensed) that will have you bopping along to the action. The voice cast is utterly superlative, too, delivering lines with real gusto. Excellent stuff. VISUALS 9/10 A stunningly attractive game boasting a crisp, clean art style that’s impossible not to love. A vibrant palette and sense of movement and energy only adds to the appeal. PLAYABILITY 9/10 While having rhythm is certainly a big plus, it won’t stymie your enjoyment of Hi-Fi Rush one iota. The action is immediate, intuitive, and constantly enjoyable. Cracking. DELIVERY 9/10 Hi-Fi Rush’s 15-20 hour duration is exactly the right length, ensuring the story doesn’t outstay its welcome. Post-game secrets will keep you coming back for more.. The best game play!!! 10/10 Thank you Xbox and tango game works and game pass one day ️. Absolutely love the gameplay and art style, one of the best games of the year. It's this wild mash-up of beat 'em up and hack 'n' slash action, but the real kicker is how it grooves to the music. I'm talking rhythm-based combos that sync up with the tunes, and it's pure magic. The developer poured their heart and soul into this one, and it's oozing with charm.. The only problem with this game is that it is very short. Combining a hack-n-slash with a rhythm game creates incredible gameplay and the animation gives it a unique feel, like that of superhero comics. The best I've had all year.. Great game very unique and refreshing great animation also definitely a must play. This year's most overrated trash. My condolences to everyone who wasted money and time on this garbage.. boring gameplay graphics look like a 360 game uninspired story and even worst ending. Hi-Fi Rush is a heartwarming, joyful and endearing experience to the end. The artstyle matches that of most saturday morning cartoons, probably due to the tone of the story and characters. The gameplay offers up a unique flow with a combination of Hack and Slash / Beat 'em up combat and rythm-based mechanics. Moving over to the story, it's nothing special on face value. On the contrary, it might seem very dull and clichee if it didn't have such an excellent execution. The charming and fun characters make the story and offer many emotional moments that are sure to make you smile and cry. The soundtrack is a crucial component to the gameplay due to its rythm-based nature. It's also full of bangers that one is cerainly going to listen to outside of the game. Some of the songs might even land up in someones ""favorite songs"" list. The gameplay resembles that of Devil May Cry, although much simpler, where you are additionally encouraged to hit to the beat of the music. It is important to mention that hitting to the beat is not a requirement, but a way to stylize combat and maximize the damage output. Adding to that, the game offers companions with cooldowns that you can call upon to help with a specific enemy or puzzle. (e.g. breaking their shield, activating ventilation, ...) The bossfights are also exceptionally done and a true highlight of the game. Where the game falls flat however, is the enemy variety. There are specific enemy types that are intended to be countered by the companions that you call upon, but that is where the variety ends, everything else is a reskin. This is a game that I will always look back fondly upon due to its heartwarming nature. If you get the chance, there is no reason not to play it.. Best musical combat I've ever experienced, I love every combat and boss fight, the beat and the music makes all of this experience even better track by track, even just chilling to the music in the title screen is so great, for me it's a good GOTY contender cause of it's originality.. A wonderful game, a good gift from Tango gameworks for us. Optimization, characters, and MUSIC, beautiful music in rhythm.. excellent game, the mod is very fun and the cartoon stile give it a good ","despite being a solo adventure, the companions you have throughout make it very alive and dynamic . with a decent helping of wacky slapstick humor, this game manages to keep a good story, and good rhythm . with new combos to learn all the time, it keeps combat fresh and keeps the game open for a second or third playthrough ."
818.Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics,"Thanks Capcom for bringing back these games! I thought these will be stuck on old systems forever.. Really great game and I am very glad they have an option to reduce screen flicker for photosensitivity!. It's hard to ask for more from this collection. Lots of great quality of life options like turning screen flash off, and secret characters, etc. The input delay is negligible, non-existent, so it feels great to play and to do combos. The only thing that could get better than this is Marvel vs Capcom 4 with 60+ characters and new age sprites and backgrounds and things like that. Hopefully that's where this takes us.. One of the best collections of all time. Only reason it's not a 10 is because of the limited quick save. One of the biggest surprise of 2024, this so called 'impossible' collection collects one of the best Capcom fighting games in one package. Its collaboration with Marvel introduced us to some really great games, and frantic gameplay thatremains unmatched even until today. A must buy.","the input delay is negligible, non-existent, so it feels great to play and to do combos . one of the biggest surprises of 2024, this so called 'impossible' collection collects one of the best Capcom fighting games in one package ."
819.Velocity Ultra,"Incredibly solid scrolling shooter that takes a lot of inspiration from classic shoot'em'up style while implementing increasingly challenging mechanics to keep the gameplay tight and tough, but manageable. Highly recommend. I must admit I'm not the greatest enthusiast of Shoot-'Em-Up games but Velocity Ultra is quite an incredible feat. It shines as one of the most entertaining fast-paced games on the VITA. Visually it looks quite simple and the sound department isn't the most impressive around, but it truly shines regarding its gameplay. There were a few poorly-designed levels in my opinion but the excellent ones heavily outnumber the weak ones. Adernaline-packed levels where you need to hone your skills and reflexes. Some challenging achievements to be completed. This game offers good longevity thanks to its extra missions and gives you good reasons to replay most of its levels. Not a perfect game, but definitely a must-play.. Wanted to play it since I saw a trailer in YouTube. I am not used to buy digital games, but I did it, and absolutely not regret it. Funny, challenged, well balanced and maybe a little bit short, but definitely a very good game.. Velocity Ultra is actually a fun, fast paced, and addicting little game. It is exhilarating as you race against time to get the gold and feels very rewarding when you destroy/kill items/enemies. The game is not going to wow anyone, but don't judge a book by it's cover, the gameplay is very fun. Although this is not a game I would run out the door to buy since it's not a ""big triple a game""/ basically a repetitive game/ doesn't have much of a story; it's still a good game for what it is, and honestly wished this was what resogun would've resembled on the ps4 (didn't like resogun). check this game out if you have some time to kill.. A fantastic, old-school feeling side scrolling shooter with enough modern touches to set it apart from the crowd. It might very well be one of the best downloadable games on PSN. It's addictive and will keep you coming back for more. It's main gameplay hooks of teleporting and speed work fantastically, and it's just an all around fantastic package. My total score for the game is a 9.1/10=Amazing. I highly recommend you check this one out.. Velocity Ultra is completely unlike any other shmup in a good way. The teleportation mechanic adds depth to the gameplay and makes the formula more addictive. It's accessible but very fun a good quality for portable games.. Velocity Ultra is a masterpiece.I'm a fanatic of Shoot'm up and this game is **** teleport between zones,the speed,the dual stick,the music,etc it is a reflect of a work well done. If you have a psvita,you should buy **** simple as that. Greatness awaits,well,Velocity 2x is that greatness.. Velocity ultra is a great portable game. The bite sized levels are challenging and addictive. More than once i almost forgot to get out of the train in time because i was in the middle of a mission. The comic book cut scenes are cute but the story does not really add anything to the experience. This is not a problem because gameplay and level design are the main focus and they completely deliver on those parts.. If you own a PS Vita and are a fan of shoot em ups or not, I recommend this game. It's got good graphics and sound. The control method is easy to master and the game won't disappoint. I think it's only available via the PlayStation Store as I have not seen it in any stores that sell PS Vita games.. Velocity Ultra is a must-own on for the Vita, PS3, and/or PC. It's a vertical shooter with lots of accessibility and great controls. Joris de Man's music sounds excellent and goes with the game. It holds up great with nice visuals and and at 60fps. It is also loaded with tough challenges, the game Snake, Minesweeper, and two-player mini-games as well. Makes for a worthy pick-up and play experience.. This game is just too much fun, I had it as a Mini and now its even better: trophy support, HD visuals, and a kick ass comic book style cutscenes. I have no idea what's going on with the story, but the drawings are nice nonetheless. It is all about gameplay, though. Level designs are tight and controls feel very precise. The latter levels are quite hard, but its always a good time. Velocity should be right up your alley if you're into shoot em ups and puzzle games. I personally like the straight forward levels more (some that you have to shoot all enemies, or rush trough the level due to time constraints). The more elaborate, puzzle like levels are cool as well, but they require some memorization and I'm awful at that. I should warn, though, that it might not be to everybody. If you're looking for fancy graphics or epic sagas, this game is not for you. I showed Velocity to my nephews (9 and 11 YO), and they couldn't get into the straight forward approach and difficulty level. They'd rather play Fifa and Uncharted on easy, so they can feel like super powerful dudes.. Got this game part of PS Plus. It's awesome and loved the challenges it brought on each level. Gameplay is cool and levels are well designed. Sweet classic mini games were also fun. I loved it.. As a self-confessed huge shmup-aholic, I, along with an overwhelming number of PSP owners who took the plunge, utterly adored Velocity in it's original, 'Minis' form. However despite it's critical success (culminating in 9 out of 10 reviews from the esteemed pages of EDGE and Pocket Gamer), as a package, I must admit to harbouring an unshakable tinge of disappointment that, as a game built from the ground up for last-gen hardware, Velocity was unfortunately lacking the polish that it's otherwise high-end tactility and gameplay so desperately deserved. This was particularly evident when playing on a Playstation Vita. Aside from the now ubiquitous inclusion of highscore leaderboards to climb and PSN trophies to hoard, all that was needed was that final layer of HD-spit and native OLED-polish that would truly elevate this high-grade shooter to the lofty heights of indie folklore. Well, at least as far as Playstation indies are concerned. And now with the utterly fabulous Velocity Ultra, British based outfit, FuturLab are finally able to bask in all the glory and plaudits that their wonderfully nuanced and deeply rewarding IP so richly deserved from the very beginning. Having had a love affair with 8 and 16-bit pixel art for as long as I can remember, I must admit to initial pangs of disappointment to find the absence of the original games beautifully 'old skool' visual flavour, but I have always trusted this developers judgement, and pretty much consider their shift in presentational style to be a necessary evil of sorts. Regardless of what type of game floats your particular boat, Velocity Ultra is a truly exceptional game, much less one confined to the genre-specific reaches of shoot'em-up fame. As such, it represents the very embodiment of Sony's hugely appreciated pursuit of bringing some of the very finest offerings from the indie community to handheld and console audiences, both this gen and next. And I for one, couldn't be happier. 9 out of 10. It is shockingly, almost unbelievably, just so very much better than the original. Combine this with Sine Mora and you have yourself the perfect escape for that daily four hour train commute to and from work. And then some.","incredibly solid scrolling shooter that takes a lot of inspiration from classic shoot'em'up style . a fantastic, old-school feeling side scrolling shooter with enough modern touches to set it apart from the crowd . visuals aren't the most impressive around, but it truly shines regarding its gameplay ."
82.Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots,"Masterpiece, the best ending to the series 1010 game. Replaying this series in chronological order and finishing it with this game makes you realize how good this story is.. A fantastic conclusion to the Metal Gear story. I thought every detail of this game was incredibly well thought out and works very well. I loved the parts where you have to sneak through a battlefield. You can see the war unfold, with each side fighting and pushing each other back. Different military vehicles aid the factions. It's incredibly dynamic and I loved it. I also really liked the story. It was sad, awesome and conclusive. The characters were fantastic. The missions were all unique and engaging. I love this game a lot. I'd definitely recommend playing this game after playing all the other Metal Gear games, otherwise, it'll probably be confusing.. This was my first MGS game, I thought the graphics at the time were amazing, the storyline was decent, the gameplay was fun but a little difficult and not as rewarding as others in the genre. My biggest complaint were the cutscenes, this was the first game I remember where this saturation of cutscenes tainted the game. Just when I was getting into it a 2 hour cutscene kills all the joy, this is a trend that continues today and its one of the biggest things I hate about modern gaming.. Metal Gear Solid 4 is an incredible game, that provides a fun story for fans of the franchise.. While Guns of the Patriots boasts lashings of in-game invention and creativity that's largely wrapped up in superb style and execution, it's all so unforgivably tainted by jaw-dropping gameplay brevity that it's truly difficult to raise the many, many good points above what is, for the most part, a succession of cut scenes that leave the player with an overwhelming sense of disconnection from one of gaming's most compelling characters and interactive franchises.. How wonderful, I thought GRAND THEFT AUTO IV WAS AWESOME. But this game, everything about it is incredible, how Hideo Kojima made this game run on the PLAYSTATION 3, it's unimaginable... Well speaking of graphics, it manages to be the best of 2008 by far. In every case hahaha... Its cutscenes are really, really big, it's scary hahaha. But that's the price you have to pay for playing such a masterpiece.... The superior processing power of the PS3 meant that Hideo Kojima's vision could finally be fully realised with truly cinematic cut scenes, a far more intuitive control system and more forgiving difficulty level; you can actually fight your way out of situations instead of discovery meaning an instant ""GAME OVER"". Some of the dialogue and characterisation is still a little clunky, but no more than your average anime movie. A classic bit of stealth gaming.. I have nostalgia for MGS4. The opening cutscene is a masterpiece in itself. So incredibly ambitious and epic.. Gameplay has oddly aged worse than that of the first 3 titles. The story has an insanely interesting premise (an economy run by private military contactors) but is drowned out by fan service. MGS2 is the pinnacle of the series in shaping the game around its themes, boldly excising familiar characters where they don't serve the premise being explored. The most interesting aspects of MGS4 are drowned out by catch-up sessions with characters from MGS2-4 and extravagantly long cutscenes that seem to exist only for Kojima to prove he could make an action movie if given a chance.. So, this is probably my most decisive game in the series for me. On one hand: the game looks amazing and at the time was the pinnacle of videogame graphics, the gameplay is the most refined its ever been and the most enjoyable to play, and the last act of the game is an amazing end to the Metal Gear Series. But on the other hand: the story kinda gets too ridiculous at some points (even for Metal Gear), I have mixed feelings about the fate of many characters from the series, and the Beauty and the Beast bosses are the creepiest parts of the game, like they legit made me feel uncomfortable with how proactive the gratuitous camera angles were. And some of the cutscenes go on for WAY too long. It feels like nobody reigned in Kojima and he kinda a George Lucas moment. However, like I said, he nails the landing in the last act of the game. There are three moments in particular, one of them being the final boss fight, that are some of the most iconic moments in videogame history. So, despite its flaws, I more or less enjoyed the final game in the Metal Gear series. Kojima, you're pretty good.. The best game I've ever played in my life characters story cinematography bossfights I LOVE THIS GAME!. “Guns of the Patriots” is a masterpiece with a twist…it’s more of a movie than a game. This is another innovative creation by Kojima that subverted expectations. There’s no doubt that “Guns” is a great accomplishment. It has fantastic graphics and is packed with amazing moments and innovative features. But the length of the cutscenes will certainly test the patience of many players. The story itself picks up many years after “Sons of Liberty”. It is a worthy final entry in the adventures of Solid Snake. If you’re a fan of sci-fi action epics, then you’re going to love this. I would rate it with a 9.3 out of 10. .. Best Metal Gear Solid evermade long cutscenes love it characters love it prologue love it middle love it epilogue love it. Long cinematics, yes. However, they are astounding. Insane graphics for the time and great gameplay coupled with a complicated yet enthralling story make for an instant classic. The end of Snake's story.. 'MGS 4: Guns of the Patriots' is at its best when confronting old demons, addressing previous questions, and reflecting on existing— as a piece of media, as a reflection of the journey it's brought players along. Less of a new chapter and more of a long-awaited, much-needed conversation about itself. For as the series' final reckoning best puts it; from zero we came and, at one point, to zero we must return.. You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. My favorite game from the ps2 era. Kojima crushed it.. The first true big hitter PS3 exclusive, this game certainly does not disappoint. May even be the best MGS game as well.. Graphics: 8/10; Storyline: 10/10; Gameplay: 10/10; Atmosphere: 10/10; Music: 10/10; Summary rating: 10/10. I don't need to detail, argue or explain what has already been said and repeated. I will just say for the umpteenth time that it is one of the greatest games in history, belonging to one of the greatest video game licenses. One of the best PlayStation 3 exclusives if not the best, and the best game of 2008 along with Grand Theft Auto IV. Thank you Kojima-San for all that, eternal gratitude for having delivered such a work to us with its emblematic characters, each more endearing than the other, and thank you for sharing with us all these musical and cinematographic references. Metal Gear Solid is one of those licenses that alone proves that video games are an art in their own right, a magnificent art that can combine the best of cinema, music and literature, but also painting, drawing and many other art forms. As Joan Baez and the late Ennio Morricone would say: ""Here's to you Solid Snake; Rest forever in our hearts; The last and final moment is yours; That agony is your triumph"".. Not as good as the outstanding second part, but it is surely my number two. It is a typical Kojima experience - like a great long movie. Overall rating: 9.4.. In 2008, Metal Gear Solid IV: Guns of the Patriots was the most hyped PS3 game. A console exclusive that was deemed a system seller, it was the conclusion to hero Solid Snake's story. Now ten years old, it's easy to see why the game was considered a critical success; it's a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling with some innovative features. But unlike its predecessors, MGS IV is more movie than video game and that's where some of its flaws lie. While this concluding chapter follows the formula established by MGS 1, it also contains even longer cutscenes and some underwhelming sections. The game is also more comparable to Gears of War than Splinter Cell due to its third-person shooter mechanics. Stealth is more of an option since there is an overabundance of firearms, attachments and ammunition. Like Grand Theft Auto IV (also released in 2008), this entry was hailed by critics as being the franchise's best installment on its launch day. While that is certainly arguable, there's no denying that MGS IV took advantage of the PS3's technology. This entry is one of the most impressive looking games on the PS3. It's also loaded with all the nutty features, hidden Easter eggs and eccentric bad guys the series is well known for. Of course, it's not for everyone. But if you're a die-hard MGS fan, you will love it despite all its imperfections. Thought I never played the multiplayer and have issues with the campaign, I would still give this a 9.3 out of 10.. A wonderful end for Solid Snake, It's easy to see how much love Hideo Kojima has for his characters.. Kojima is Kojima, with his angles, direction, music and game trifles, I went through it with joy, although the game is difficult for me... the plot is super fantastic and, in my opinion, with a mixture of nonsense (it's still Kojima), from the minuses it is optimization games.. and it is not clear what to do in a fight with Vamp). Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is wacky, but in all the right ways. Good gameplay, but a bit stiff. Solid story and voice acting. Decent graphics. 100% Kojima. A must play on the PS3.. I do not care there a lot of fan service and if you think it was dumb well F you. I only played this game once and I can remember what happened . Seeming Snake a young here in the first Metal Gear to MGS4 in a short amount of time. A man who was created to inherit big boss legacy as the perfect son to a man who is going to be a weapon if he fails. Raiden child solider to someone who captured by the patriots with lies . And its a shame there is on Remastered coming to PS5 or a PC because why would Konami think about making good quality games . Since they making money from MGS high remastered cutscenes **** and Castlevania ****. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The worst game i have ever played in my entire life the AI in this game is a joke giving this game a decent score is a big joke. Excellent masterpiece that is easily one of the best games, if not the best game ever made. I just came delivers more to the PlayStation then any game. A wonderful experience, this is the perfect ending for solid snake, and the franchise overall, the game play feels like a evolved-new generation metal gear, the story is nostalgic and incredible, the characters conflicts are fantastic, and I also the story arc for snake, the fact that he is dying is sad, and is a nice touch, 10/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Love it or hate it Metal Gear Solid 4 is objectively one of the best games on the 7th Generation of Consoles. It's ashame the only way you can play it is on the Playstation 3 I hope somehow they re release it on the PS5 and port it to PC but I doubt they will. Alot of cinematics, maybe too many but a great story and improved gameplay.. Quite a deep and lovely game. The more you play the other games before in the series the more references and final ties you see it make in this game. This was supposed to be the last Metal Gear Hideo made and it pulled all the correct stops. Unfortunately the community attacked him to make more and we got Metal Gear Solid 5 The Phantom Pain in which Hideo’s story was far and beyond what Konami had the budget for.. Unlike other MGS games Guns of the Patriots focuses solely on story and characters, gameplay plays the minor role. Though game is stuffed through and through with new cool mechanics, features and so on, it just not enough time for them to be shown properly: for every 30 minutes of gameplay we have an hour of cutscenes. That's the reason why MGS 4 has the smallest replayability in the series for me. BUT... the first playthrough was so great, i can still remember how emotionally shocked (in a good way) i was when i saw the ending for the first time. Still one of the best moment in vidya. So... 8/10. Much like the titles that preceded it, MGS 4 has become a landmark in the video game sphere through its transformative uses (and sometimes, even instances co-dependence) in regards to in-game cinematics. It's exceptionally hard to find a game that could justify such an overwhelming amount of non-playable segments when compared to your average gameplay, but because of the attention to detail and genuine love for the series pouring out of every proverbial pixel, you can't help but admire what the team at Kojima Productions has created here. Through countless development troubles (and even death threats) they managed to create one of the most beautiful send-offs to such a legendary character. There may have been some rough points gameplay-wise or narrative-wise, but when looked at as a whole, this game is a product of its time... and a legendary one at that. It serves as a reminder of simpler times in the gaming industry, when creativity could still shine through. Where it wasn't about blindly following trends, but sticking to your vision and trusting that the team you're in will make something worthwhile. Nostalgia is certainly playing a significant role here, but even as a stand-alone title, MGS 4 is a remarkable example of unyielding ambition that resulted in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Thank you Kojima Productions. Best of luck in your future endeavours.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Revisited this game in 2022. I bought it on day 1 but only played it these days. As an MGS fan I think a lot of its value comes from nostalgia. I appreciated that, but a person who is not that familiar may not enjoy it. Storywise it was good, I enjoyed understanding BB history and the characters are fun. The story like some others MGS is about the future wars and soldiers. It will surely attract SiFi fans but others not so sure. Like other MGS there are two ways to play MGS , the pro sneaking stealth way and the casual friendly just kill everything with your guns, Drebin make the casual gameplay more accessible. I can say that I liked the game more before shadowmosses. Once I reached Shadowmoses it felt like the devs had to rush everything and it lost little of its fun. I will rank it as my least favorite MGS game, MGS2 being the most favorite.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Martin A. - A masterpiece! A work of Art in the form ****! This game had the whole weight of the world on it's shoulders and still proceeded to make Metal Gear Solid Online as a free game mode (at the time). There is nothing to say about 10/10 games. Go in knowing as little as possible about this game and have the time of your life! 10 out 10.. absolutely fantastic game, must own for every ps3 owners!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Great movie and a great ending to one of the best games of the history. Insane story and great action. Great game, and very emotional as well This is a masterpiece by Kojima, and a great game. This is just an amazing game, without a doubt one of the best games in history.. One of the best metalgearsolid games, you wust want more and more of the story and you are hooked ot it! Kojima is a genius!. fantastic game that have it all.. you are in the story to the end.. it is like controlling a movie. I recommend this 100%. Another classic byt kojima, this man is a genius! Metal gear solid is one of the best games out there and you have to buy it and try it. Snake and Raiden are very good and this gmaei s very emotional. buy it. This may be an unpopular opinion-but I really didn't like this game. Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not going into this cold. I've played every MGS game up to this one. But where MGS1 and 3 told fairly simple and contained stories, this one is more inline with MGS2. Which is to say, nonsense. I know that this game is supposed to be ""high art"", but it feels like talking to someone who really likes the sound of their own voice. When people say the cutscenes are long, it's not just the actual time it takes, it's the fact that between the stilted and poorly translated dialogue and the repeated, drawn-out exposition I can't even tell you how many times I fell asleep during a cutscene and had to restart it. I do really like a good story in video games, but everything here just feels like a crap anime. There is a good story here (and the nostalgia of act 4 is a high point) but it's drawn and spread out for the sake of being artsy. And we've got a healthy dose of toilet humor and female characters designed by 13 year olds. It should also be mentioned that the gameplay sections (less than half the runtime of the game) are straight out of 1998. You still get that weird hunched shoulders running and you have to stop dead to hit the crouch button, otherwise you'll dive. But don't worry so much about that-you're only running from cutscene to another cutscene anyway. So I think the real questions you need to ask before diving in are: Did you want Solid Snake to be older with a dad mustache? Do you want a 20 minute phone call explanation of each weirdly buxom boss AFTER you kill them? Do you want someone to spell out for you why war is bad over and over? Are you in to the type of story where you might spend several minutes watching a little girl cook eggs? What about the type of story that might culminate in a slap fight between two geriatrics? If the answer to any of these questions is ""yes"", then go for it.. Still a must play, but has questionable mechanics such as turning into a fighting game for a boss fight, and far too excess in fan service. Story wise, it tries to *finish* the franchise's story (even though KONAMI didn't want the game to end at the time) which ends up as a mashup of ideas and even more plot holes. I give it 7 farts out of 10.. ooh soo good 2nd to last game in the time line and the end to solid snakes story it really is amazing. Hideo Kojima does it again. This game is a true masterpiece, and I don't say this lightly. If you are a fan of The Metal Gear Solid franchise you know what I mean when I say that most games directed by Hideo Kojima feels like an interactive movie and this one is not the exception. The graphics were at the top the gaming industry when this game came out and I can say it's still better…. Ladies and gentlemen.. the best game ever made in the history of video games, 11 out of 10, name something that isn’t perfect here ? Yeah you, cuz this one delivers an epic finale for the series with a story that exceeds any entertainment media work, all the legendary characters face each other or cooperate, the epic clash it’s finally happening, Solid snake tells everyone why he is still the man and the best character in video games history, genuis gameplay and mechanics that it’s ahead of it’s time, heart touching all feelings story plot with perfect pacing, bossfights, guns and dejavous soundtrack/cinamatics perfection and next gen graphics, addictive multiplayer as the icing on the cake, it’s good .. isn’t ?. Truly the start of the Kojima that we all now know him for, for better or for worse.. Wonderful infiltration, amazing story telling, excellent game system, it is perfect for series funs.. I got a lot of pleasure during the passage, but damn, after MGS 2 and 3 the game feels weaker. But the bosses are great here.. First of all i love the mgs games i will never bad mouth them but boy this game really disappointed me. The movie cut scenes are great such a site to see personages finally really good, but there just way too damn long it's get boring and disrupts the play time, suddenly you need to do something else because the time you wanted to play is gone. Cause i was so glad to see meryl again only to see her go in game very fast again not even usable. Game play info says not to kill either side and to sneak and hide, yet it unbelievable gives you a ton of weapons wickedly cool i didn't know what to do with it, that's not good it's ****. I didn't even want to play the game a second time just for that because of those damn long cutscenes. Those are the important ones not bother with anything else, but this is by far a movie not a game and never seen such a thing before.. I’ve recently finished this game and it’s nothing but unforgettable and extraordinary. It’s an emotional conclusion to the Metal Gear saga which holds a special place in my heart and it’s simply amazing.. As incredible as it sounds, this is my first metal gear solid to play, I was fascinated with the story, the gameplay, the visuals all seemed amazing, this game is a masterpiece that is mandatory to play. Story: 10 Game play: 10 Music: 9 Visuals: 10 Personal Score: 10 A MASTER PIECE !!. Legendary masterpiece perfect conclusion to the best video game series of all time. Still very playable and fun as when it came in 2008.. My favourite game. Perfect blend of story telling and game play. With each play through I discovered hidden features I had previously missed. Even the cut scenes are interactive. Definitely a “guys” game, female players might be offended lol.. This is the first Metal Gear game I didn't exactly enjoy. I guess it's a competent enough game from a gameplay standpoint but this story is just... annoying, for lack of a better term. I didn't need this game, I didn't want this game... but here it is anyway. It answers questions that I didn't ask, it sloppily puts in convenient plot points for the sake of fan service and it takes away almost all the charm that I fell in love with from the first 3 games. The best thing I can say storywise is there were a few parts that made me chuckle and if you ignore this one, it doesn't really take away from the original 3. The only part of this game that I legitimately enjoyed was Shadow Moses. It was the only fan service moment I enjoyed and it was honestly just really cool to see that iconic area in HD. It's probably the only part of the game I think I would ever want to revisit. Most of the game is inferior stealth, easy boss battles and incredibly annoying on rail shooting sections. Not to mention more forced combat segments than any Metal Gear game before it. Basically, everything I don't like about the Metal Gear series is brought to the forefront here. At least I'll always have the first 3. I beat this game in December of 2019.. Kojima did it again! History showed again and again, that this stealth series is more than just gaming. It´s an aesthetic and philosophical experience. Just as Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns Of The Patriots. This game is so well narrated and designed, that you sometimes loose touch weather it´s a game or a thrilling movie. One of the best games for the PlayStation 3!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Excellent game that follows the same pattern of the previous metal gear, only improved. Without adding, it is the best ending to give a saga as long and emotional as this one is.. This game isn't bad, its disappointing. There's not as much freedom of gameplay as the previous entries and it takes itself way too serious, there's technically more freedom of gameplay when compared to the previous entries but you're still pushed to go about the objective in a certain way. Stealth isn't as vital to the gameplay which was one of the core mechanics that drew in many players to the series in the first place, the ability to buy ammo whenever, wherever takes away the incentive to avoid conflict and it makes it feel more like a shooter rather than what I knew as MGS. A lot of what they choose to retcon seems very unnecessary and forced, unlike MGS3 it feels like it relies on the popularity and critical acclaim of the previous entries to trick players into thinking its a worthy entry simply because it has the characters and plot we've grown to love.. Sons of Liberty never seems to have a dull moment when it comes to it's story, or it's gameplay. It's truly worth having a PS3 for. It's real shame it's not on other platforms. It simply is a must own for any fan of the series.. Great MGS but i feel its a little bit under his predecesors. Still mandatory for the fans.. Amazing conclusion to the series. I didn't mind the cutscenes one bit as it offered balanced segments of great gameplay and deep story. I think the game looked stunning for its time and it's still one of the best spectacles to behold in gaming. This IS my favorite MGS game.. Top game. Best end of the kojima's story. Excellent graphics, excellent gameplay.. No jokes, this game literally changed my life, an amazing piece of art that goes way beyond the simple term of ""videogame"".","replaying this series in chronological order and finishing it with this game makes you realize how good this story is . i thought every detail of this game was incredibly well thought out and works very well . my biggest complaint were the cutscenes, this is one of the biggest things i hate about modern gaming ."
820.There is no game : Wrong dimension,"4th wall breaking Puzzle game with tons of creativity, gaming references and heart.. this game is so boring, the first puzzle made me chuck my dog out the window, R.I.P Taffy.. It was fun at first, but then it just started to bore me at around the third chapter. Good puzzle game for anyone interested, but i don't think i'll be going back to it.. Short and sweet, and really really special. The puzzles are fun, the humor was entertaining, and as for the way the story unfolds... I wasn't expecting a genuinely emotional experience, but that's what this game delivers.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game ever (Exadurated). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. this is probably rated as one of the best games on the switch purely because of markiplier's endorsement. it doesn't look too bad, but at 3 hours and with little to no replay value despite the number of easter eggs, it is really not worth the exorbitant prices being charged for it. i remember the creator posting some content on newgrounds years ago, and its cool to see indie devs being successful, but there is no reason why this needs to be rated higher than much higher quality games like disco elysium, ace attorney, and Shin megami tensei V to name just a few which were notably ranked just below this. even KOTOR, a 20 year old game cheaply ported to the console, deserves more credit than there is no game does.. I really enjoyed my playthrough of this! I'm not a big fan of Point and Click Adventures, but this game had such good reviews that I decided to pick it up on sale. The playing experience is seamless from start to finish. The narrative is humorous and witty and the plot is engaging. This is a really polished game that is well paced, full of variety, and full of surprises too! I did appreciate the help feature for the few occasions when I got temporarily stuck, but most of the puzzles are well designed and there are some really memorable and original moments dotted throughout the game. Two things have held me back giving this game a higher score. (1) It only took me 6 hours to play through, which is a bit short, and (2) at full price I feel this game is a bit expensive for what it is. I may come back to this and play through it again in a year or two, but there is no incentive to revisit this title before then as much of it's appeal is derived from its novelty value. This is certainly worth picking up when it is on sale! I'm really glad to have had the experience of playing through this game!. Very solid and interesting game. Lots of funny mechanics and clever story ideas. Main plot is really interesting and engaging. There is a lot of unexpected moments and quite a few that will live longer in our memories after the end.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. There is no game: wrong dimension might seem too short for some people, but it is still worth it. This ""non-game"" makes fun of a lot of stuff in the gaming industry and is pretty funny. You will have to often think outside the box to solve the puzzles you meet. Overall, this game is amazing and i definitely recommend it for anyone that is into indie games.. There Is No Game is a small indie game exploding with spunk, character, and originality. The game play is challenging and unique, and the storyline is unexpected and quirky. It reminds me of the PC games I played as a child in the 90s/00s, yet it pushes farther to create something completely new. I can't wait to see what this developer comes out with next!. A short, but very fun game. It's a perfect fit to play before decide to compromise to a longer game, especially if you are a fan of classic 90's point & click games (or not games). This one has the best of it, but with a very imaginative twist. The story itself and interactions are very clever and funny. Easter eggs & references are too. As a con maybe it has that it is indeed short (8-12 hour play) and the lack of replay value that haver all games of this genre. Even thought, worth the price.. There is no game: wrong dimension is simply just really good, it’s funny, witty, and it makes fun of free to play games which is just great. Also the story is great too, this isn’t a really a spoiler but I will say that something in real life affected how the later part of the game plays out and I think it’s clever. Point and clicks aren’t for everyone but for those who do like them, you will have a field day with this “non-game”.. There is no game wrong dimension does something I rarely see in games. It hooks you in and makes you addicted to it in under 8 hours. The way the story is executed is like something out of a movie, and there are many times where I was belly laughing. Draw me a pixel went all-out on this, and it shows. there are plenty of little details, for example, if you go to the pause menu, the biggest button is ""go back to the menu"" but there are some downsides to this wonderful game. The point and click part of this game is a bit hard to control (I played this on the Nintendo switch) if not played in handheld mode. If you cast it up to a TV, the controls become slow and a bit hard to use. For example, (Spoilers!) in the RPG part of the game where you have to shrink the barrels to get the bomb to the pile of rocks, it is near impossible when playing it with a controller. But in handheld mode (which will drastically change speedrunning for the game btw,) you can do it with a lot of precision and ease. So overall, even with the eh controls, this game is a goddamn masterpiece. 10 out of 10.","this is probably rated as one of the best games on the switch purely because of markiplier's endorsement . at 3 hours and with little to no replay value despite the number of easter eggs, it is really not worth the exorbitant prices being charged for it . the narrative is humorous and witty and the plot is engaging ."
821.Forza Horizon 3: Hot Wheels,"Already had a blast playing the initial game but this hot wheels add on makes it a whole new experience. The game is built to be fun and enthralling. Realism outweighing the competition in terms of visual effects and mechanics. If only GT7 was this fun but alas F2P mechanics in a full price game can have detrimental effects.. absolutely fantastic, the ability to make a hot wheels DLC with those insane graphics is just incredible and it is so much fun to play and replay. highly highly recommended. The best DLC I've ever played in my entire life. It's so hyped. Even if you don't race and just drive through the map it's so cool and fun. I've gained 3stars for every single match to unlock all content and that was a great experience.. Possibly the best DLC to ever come to the world. Who doesn't want to ride a Hot Wheels race track?! Made me giddy AF to play in the beautiful world of Forza Horizon 3. Love when a video game can fulfill your youthful fantasies.. Possibly one of my favourite DLC's of all time. Getting to zip around on giant hotwheel tracks satisfied the child in me to no end (I am 30). Should have been more hotwheel cars, so not a perfect score for this DLC. If you have been enjoying Horizon 3, then this will be an excellent addition for you.. It's like a childhood fantasy brought to life in realistic **** with lots of ORANGE! Everything you enjoy about the graphics, car handling, and fun of the Forza Horizon series set loose on a crazy Hot Wheels fantasy world seemingly designed by an eight year old who somehow managed to convince the world's best engineers to build it for real - it's a marriage of two great brands that somehow makes perfect sense. Bottom line: it's just pure joy and fun with cars in a very polished package.. If you love the forza series, than you will love Forza Horizon 3. If you love FH3 and you loved hot wheels as a kid, than you will definitely love this. This sort of expansion I would've never expected in a game like this, so much stupidly yet dangerously fun stunts. This DLC could not get any better. It combines FH3 with Hot wheels beat that from the PS2 & Nintendo DS, both some of my favourite racing games of all time. This pack is definitely worth $20 ($30 AUD) whether you are a fan of hot wheels or not, but as long as you love Forza. This and Blizzard Mountain have proven that no matter how unrealistic some of these stunts and features may be, it still works very well in a racing game like this. This is way better than both of the expansions we ever got in Forza Horizon 2 and this one is definitely Playground Games finest work at an expansion pack.. Hot Wheels DLC is one of the best DLCS on Forza takes me back to being a kid again i never had soo much fun in my life playing this DLC . Forza Horizon 3 is one of the the best racing games on xbox one u get a good dlc for just $19.00 buy now u will not be disappointed. This Hot Wheels DLC is something I never knew I wanted and after playing it for 5 hours I am totally hooked to Forza Horizon 3 even more than before. Forza Horizon 3 is by far the best racing game this generation. Im not a big fan of the Forza Motorsports series since its a bit too hardcore for me but its also great. It feels like Forza is the single handed reason why the racing genre is becoming more relevant again. Hopefully when GT Sport drops on PS4 this year it will be just as good. PS4 owners deserve an elite racing experience from GT like Xbox provides its owners with Forza. The Hot Wheels DLC is simply and Epic experience that can be appreciated by hardcore and casual racing fans. Its like Mario Kart for real cars, simply amazing visuals, and so much detail has been put into this DLC its insane. Truly a must play game for Xbox owners or Racing fans.",hot wheels add on is the best DLC I've ever played in my entire life . it's like a childhood fantasy brought to life in realistic **** with lots of ORANGE . i've gained 3stars for every single match to unlock all content .
822.Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered,"A perfect game for fans of spider-man. I was excited to play this game for a long time and finally when I started, this was the perfect experience I wanted. No superhero game compares to this except the Arkham Series.. One of my favorite games of all time. I have been a big fan of the Spidey for a long time but never had the chance to play the game until 2022. A masterpiece! And, as probably what the spider would do, it helped me in difficult moments.. One of the best action games ever made. Period. You really do feel like Spider-Man, taking down the villains. The story is engaging. The voice acting is top notch. The graphics are really good. The combat is fluid and fun. It is one of the few games I really have zero complaints. I almost never give out a perfect score but Spider-Man deserves it.. Very late to the Spider-Man train but this is an absolute banger! First game in a long time that I didn't want to take breaks from.. Fun gameplay and looks pretty good. Story is above average. Other than that its a pretty ok game with forgettable missions.. It’s an epic game with a compelling story and solid mechanics. Crashes are rare, and any glitches that do occur don’t significantly impact the experience. Without a doubt, this is a must-play title.. The first good game after the Batman games ended. Surprisingly fluid gameplay with a interesting story.. Spider-Man Remastered looks great, plays great, and is great. The new web-spinning mechanics feel organic, and smooth. Just like back in the days of Spider-Man 2 on the PS2, I spent a lot of time booting around the city as fast as I could and having a blast doing nothing to further my progress. The game isn’t overly long, which I actually appreciate since it feels like they kept things consistently solid throughout. There were a few moments that dragged a little or didn’t quite match the bar set by the rest of the game, but I’m nitpicking. There's also a few boss battles that might even surpass the final battle in quality, and that's saying something as the final boss battle was really well done. Only things I noticed that annoyed me was pacing at certain moments and some weird design decisions, but overall I can't think of much negative to say about the experience. I had a great time and now I’m moving on to Miles Morales game next, pumped to get into it.. A great start to the series. The game has amazing story. Some of the best traversal seen in gaming, and some really solid combat mechanics.. Really a nice game, in terms of plot and gameplay absolutely enjoyable and fun. With the Remastered you have free DLC that allow you to experience the full story.. a refreshing take on the character of spider-man after the mediocrity of the Tom Holland movies. Spider-Man remastered is a game worth every single penny spent, and I don’t say that about many games yet alone remasters. The PlayStation 4 remaster come to pc shines in its updated models, and excellent ray tracing details. New York comes alive with random crime events, and missions taking place throughout the city. For you 100%ers the collectibles in this game are actually pretty fun, and will have you wondering how Peter could ever afford that many damn backpacks. Combat does not disappoint giving you a plethora of combinations and abilities to choose from. Choose the suit, and add-ons, YOU want to use and go beat up the bad guys one crime at a time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Improves the graphics of the previous one, as mentioned in the review of the PS4 version. Great game.. A very cool adventure and action game. And the plot is good even in comparison with films about Spider-Man.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Generally good game. But DLC is smh pure trash. Black cat was fun, but just more of the same, but super unbalanced and broken. Controller don’t even work right. Some Mission need restart b/c it just stops spamming enemies etc.. Buttons mit Registrierung etc. DLC just feel lazy and bloated and you only do it so you have done it. Base Story 9/10 gameplay 8/10, DLC overall 5/10.. A phenomenal game with a fantastic story. The gadgets are the best of the Insomniac Spider-Man games and I wish they would’ve come back in future titles. The stealth was also the best of the series. However, in comparison to Spider-Man 2, the swinging mechanics feel slow and restrictive by comparison. This single factor makes this game much less enjoyable to revisit. Still an amazing Spider-Man game though.. very beautiful graphics & gameplay mechanics are super fun. i've only been through the story once but i feel like theres a lot of replayability especially with the side quests and token objectives. first game 2 make me cry in a while. will be replaying it and will try out the miles morales game!. Best Spider-Man ever made. So much stuff to do outside its main story, which is very good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great game to portray Spider-Man. Web swing in the city is so enjoyable and relaxing. Look cool when fighting, but it seems to lack the wow factor to reach a higher score in 2024. Might be great at the year when the game first came.. This IS SPIDER-MAN. I've played many titles of the years for this superhero, this is THE game. THE definitive Spider-Man experience. Beginning to end, the story encapsulates what is means to be Spider-Man. The characters are touching and memorable, the plentiful missions create a refreshing experience that never grows stale, and finally the ending. Every superhero fan should play this game.. There are not too many games other than some RPG with a sword aimlessly dodging at some enemies that keeps me on my chair and focus on the story. However, Spider-Man did just that. Through its many collectibles scattered correctly thought out the map with the intention of not cluttering your UI and your brain, and its amazing story telling, I was captivated in the 70hours I poured into the game.. The story and Arkham like combat system stand the test of time. Yuri Lowenthal trumps other voice actors who took on the role and balances the Peter Park and Spider-Man aspects of the character. The game allows you to approach missions in both stealth or direct fashions with gadgets that allow diversity in combat scenarios. The number one thing this game needed to get right was the web slinging and they nailed it. The open world is filled with tons to do and you'll never fast travel while doing it. This game host many iconic Spider-Man villains and my only critique is I with that each villains had there own boss fight instead of it being grouped in teams of 2 but that won't take you out of the experience.. Has to be one of the greatest super hero stories ever with some of the best gameplay ever. Brilliant game.. Incredible game! (Masterpiece) | Marvel's Spider-Man | 100 Points (5 Stars) | Story 10P | Side Story 10P | Gameplay and Animation 10P | Graphics and Resolution 10P | Dialogue 10P | Narrative Design 10P | Character Design 10P | Species Design 10P | Dynamic and Variation 10P | Bugs and Glitches 10P. Greatest game of all time. It have fun cutscenes, good mission, good story, etc. Greatest spiderman game i played so far gonna play miles morales now. 10/10. that is how you make a spiderman game. bravo sony. another good exclusive into your great arsenal. enjoyed every minute. great story telling, astonishing graphics, perfect fight and travel mechanism.. Terrible decision on how to popularize an already perfect game, almost destroying Spidey's identity with that smarmy **** Tom Holand.. I still remember my first time playing this game as a teenager in 2018. The feeling of swinging around a completely open world NYC as the best superhero ever is unmatched. Nostalgia aside, this is still a fantastic game, the graphics even on the un-remastered version of the game, still hold up now after 6 years, the combat (though an Arkham rip off) is immersive and fun rarely ever get's old. Me and the other 16.9% of players who have platinum'd it don't regret it I guarantee you, and neither should you if you choose to do so. This game is easily up there with the best superhero games ever made, along with (not better than ) Arkham City.. I love this game it is one of the best video games of its decade with RDR2 and God of War, The modding community for this game still keeps adding more and more.. This is one of my favorite games of all time I keep coming back to it and its so much easier to play now that its on steam. I did not like the main story. I was like when they gonna stop talking and let me play. I did not like the part of side quests which was mainly go, fight them, and get respect. I liked swinging, fights were fun, and this mini games challenged me too.. Great graphics, and the game with Spider-Man is excellent, but the missions with Mary Jane are horrible.. I never expected to enjoy Spider-Man game this much. Combat is well made because even if you stumble against multiple oponents it feels believable. Graphics are cool but you need half decent PC to run it without FPS issues. I like that there are multiple outfits for Spider-Man you can choose from. Swinging around the city makes you feel alive. Story is a classic and I can´t wait for Spider-Man 2 for PC to arrive.. Score: 8.1 Such a fun game, thank you again Sony for bringing this to PC Cruising around town is probably the best part of the expirience. I beat it when it first came out, but I recently replayed it. I will say this, the story in this game is not the best part of the game, the story is good but not great either. The gameplay is good, but the tasks where we play as Mary Jane are annoying. The game is not bad, but for 1-2 times.. One of the best superhero games I've ever played. Hell, one of the best games I've ever played! The story is great! I even cried at the end. That's how good the story is. The gameplay is also fantastic. You really feel like spider man with all the combos and gadgets at your disposal. The open world is incredibly detailed and it portraits New York City exceptionally well. One of the best representations of NY I've ever seen. Everything about this game is incredible and I feel honored to have been able to play this amazing game. Insomniac Games are really one of the best current studios out there. Absolute masters of their craft.. It's a well-crafted game where everything runs smoothly and reliably, making it easily enjoyable for anyone. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Horrible writing like it was written by a 5 year old, web swinging is too slow, combat is too easy and button mashy (i literally beat the final boss by pressing 2 buttons with my nose) and the WORST thing by far are the MJ and miles missions, they are the most boring generic “stealth” gameplay and they take up literal hours of your time. I would rather play with sand that this. One of my favorite games of all time. I replayed this game so many times on PS4 and now onPC.. An amazing story that had me tearing up with fun swinging. Mj missions ****.. Pretty good but quickly feels like a long checklist of things to do on the map. It distracts from the main story line. It was a really good game. Graphics and gameplay are impressive and the story is interesting.. Excellent beginning of a favorite superhero, I liked it so much that I already know the missions by heart, I love it but Spider Man 2 turned out to be a somewhat mediocre game for me. Sometimes we rejoice, get angry, and empathize with certain characters in the game. But most of the time, we love to defeat evil and prove that Spider-Man is not the hero who's willing to lose. But also, the game teaches us that with great power comes great responsibility. This thought sometimes makes us reflect and consider making changes in our lives.. I love this game so much. It one of my favorite games. I love the swinging, the combat is smooth. And there are so many outfits.. Truly makes you feel like Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered. It can get a little overly quippy, at times, but it's hard to complain with such gorgeous graphics, smooth gameplay, and a filled city of activities to complete.. Really good, NYC feels more alive than ever but cant help but just feel as if the main story feels like a series of minigames at times But overall, an extremely enjoyable experience which i recommend. I 100% the game.. The best Spider-Man game of all time as of 2024, no matter what. The parts where you control Mary Jane may put you off the game a bit, but it's okay, the story is much better than the second game. A good port of a bad game, as I said earlier, the fullness of the world at the level of GTA 3 and Spider-Man games from the PS2. The remaster of this game is just as good as the PS4 one. About an 89-92%. The story is really good too.. Absolutely incredible. So much fun to play, controls are fluid, story is great as well. Would have been 10/10 if it wasn't too repetitive. The Fisk hideouts, then same Mr Negative guys, Ryker guys, Sable outposts, that's too much repetition. All else, amazing. good game, I played it for 55 hours, I completed it 100%, I liked the game, I had a lot of fun playing it. Masterprice game gaming controller combat grafic 10 10 10 Best hero games Best story. Welcome ass to your spidey many modies, how may i help you? This is much fun than console version, but im still using the controller. keyboard and mouse are a pain here.. Spider-man is one of the most fun open-world games that you can play, but at the same it offers little besides it's main story. I felt like the side-quests scheme is outdated, often reminding me of newer Saints Row titles.. Almost perfection, Is what I would say about this Spider-Man game, I believe it changed some of my playstyle, like I used to only play loud and stupid in stealth-optional games, but with Spider-Man, I played surprisingly stealthy. Like I said before this game is almost perfection to me... only because I only encountered 2 issues (one of them is the issue with my playstyle) with this game are only issue is the recharge time for gadgets, for me, when I'm guns-a-blazing I like using all of my gadgets like web bombs, impact webs, etc. The actual issue I had with this game is the boss fight with Rhino and Scorpion, I think it's a little too hard. I was playing on Spectacular Mode (Hard Mode) and I thought it was a bit too hard. Overall, this game is a 9/10!. Unfortunately, the wrong people always take on the spider... There were good jokes, interesting ideas, but a bad, boring plot, poor technical implementation. Now the technical implementation is good, the gameplay is convenient, but the graphics are cartoonish for children, the whole approach is childish, even immoral and stupid. Spider, especially with Watanabe in the DLC, is just incredibly childish, terrible, shame. Octopus does not looks like Octopus. There is a lot of stupidity and monotony in the game - for skills you have to do a lot of same quests, the approach is very stupid and childish, boring. Spider is very slow, weak, even for an ordinary person. These people don’t even understand what they are doing, it’s terrible. Always same story. We've seen this Octavius 100 times already, obvious plot. This is a parody of a spider, like the movie Scary Movie, banter. Also, I'm surprised by directors today who also repeat the stupidity of comics books. After all, the spider has super strength, reaction and speed. Octavius doesn't, one hit and he's dead. And this stupidity is repeated endlessly. Scoundrels who need to be executed are released. Wrong approach, many mistakes. Even photorealistic graphics of The Last of Us won't save the game, because the plot good but the approach and direction and some moments are very bad. First of all, it's not just a graphic filter that could have been added in the settings, it's also the proportions of the environment and the game mechanics. Slow doesn't mean realistic. And because in addition to the graphics, the appearance of the characters doesn't match the original and doesn't fit at all, the characters are childish, especially Peter himself. And, in general, the direction, atmosphere, script. Well, I've already talked about the gameplay. I play such games on easy difficulty (Spider, GoW, shooters), and beat bosses with super power on maximum, so that it is plausible, spider will knock out ordinary people with one finger, perception explodes when he in such games with super strength like Hulk, like Superman should beat an ordinary person (Octopus is ordinary by the way) so many times that nothing would be left of these enemies. In cutscenes he can not allegedly dodge Miles's blow, can not save a person in the main story and in DLC with no reason, it's exactly like the joke with Fisk in the beginning when Spidey says ""do you know that I see you?!"" =)) (only one joke which is funny), behaves with Watanabe in DLC like a blockhead. The attitude towards very bad guys is as if they stole gum, they should be executed. In the second part they show how they are released and given a second chance, I am shocked, this is no longer just a childish approach, this is prohibited. ETC... I liked Spider-Man the Movie 2002 game. There are all the gameplay problems and the gameplay with graphics are outdated, but the cutscenes, the approach, walkthrough, missions are amazing. Turn on the intro cutscene, you will immediately feel a huge difference. And the gameplay, the city, the atmosphere, the feeling are impressive. The flight on the web is outdated, but impressive, you just need to combine it with convenience, make a speed button, etc. to do everything correctly. The color of the textures, the sun, plot and behavior of the characters, despite the outdated graphics, feels as it should. Web of Shadows, look how they showed the beginning and Cat-woman, the cutscenes and direction, hit, realistic swing and speed. Very interesting and mysterious opponents. Listen to the jokes in these games and in **** Dimension. The cartoon 1994, it can be done just as cool, realistic graphics don't contradict. Is a genius character and story and i have never, as far as i remember, said such words in reviews. But unfortunately Marvel is for kids. Spider-Man: Friends or Foes with console graphics. And the developers who don't make NG+ and give skills late are also mentally ****. Optimization is good, and i didn't find that DLSS spoils the quality of graphics in this game. Which is not surprising, because it is simple and cartoonish anyway... )In particular, it is unlikely that this rental game, you will launch it a second time, after finishing, if you finish it at **** PC everything is 4K 60fps, old games too. Constantly discounts, all games, including ""exclusives"". And on consoles 90%+ of games are in 30 fps with terrible graphics. On PC all remote solutions and huge screens. Yes, there is a big difference in the price, but consoles are changed every few years, in addition to other disadvantages. Plus, comparison is pointless, because you can compare something possible with something possible, but playing with such terrible graphics and in 30 fps is impossible, no matter how much the PC costs, console is not an option. And i repeat, if you are smart, you will not spend money on games on pc, because of constant discounts and without buying accounts don't (continuation on Gamespot, 5000 limit... getting to play a game where you get to play as spiderman and do cool acrobatic flips I love this game literally my whole childhood wish they never changed his face. 9/10 Enjoy playing these Spider-Man games. Great story amazing gameplay and the combat fits the game.. Overall it's very good, however the parts of the game where you control Miles and MJ are rather boring. When you're Spiderman, you don't want to play someone who's afraid of everything, slowly, without much interaction. Not a big fan of the “Ubisoft-style” open world. It's pretty annoying that it's a 2018 game, having to wait 4 years to play it, really? On the other hand, the story is nice, the fights are dynamic and from time to time you really have the impression of playing in a superhero film. And it feels good.. The good : - frantic fighting. - New York city is awesome. - Excellent graphics quality. - Good optimization : in 4k max with an overclocked 7900 XTX, a 13900K and DDR5 at 7600 MT/s, framerate is between 80 and 110 fps. - outfit customization. - Manual saves. - fast boot. The bad : - A few bosses are difficult to fight which is frustrating. - Political propaganda : ""woke"" ideology, climate and ecology manipulation, freemason symbols (eye in the triangle).. While the game was pretty good overall, but it could been done without most of those immersion breaking mary jane missions. Also I didn't like matin li compared to the sinister six and fisk I would have prefered more time with any of the rather than martin li. and one skill was so OP the remaining skills felt almost useless when compared to it the skill was blossom something that throws web in every direction. I also had 5 bugs in the span of 1 hour that required me to restart the game, but only in one part of the map in the south wich is weird. i'd give it an 8, but because most of the side quest felt like chore sometimes, and the bugs I experienced it would get a 7.5 from me. It's the best looking game i've played so far, but having the same enemies with different skins and repetitive quest design with some plot holes here and there is what's keeping me from giving a 9. The gameplay was extremely fun for I'd say eight hours and then I got a little bored with the repetitiveness. The story was amazing though, really liked it.. Throwing nets, beating enemies and fighting famous enemies. This game may be the best Super-Hero game after the Batman Arkham series.. While this is still a prime example of padded gametime by repetitive side activities, those activities take place in a gorgeous environment with gameplay mechanics that stay engaging all the **** writing and pacing is off sometimes, with plot holes and exposition dumps, a comic adventure after all. The constant chitchat is hit or miss, but everything else audio-wise is top class. Animations are excellent, however the level of detail is still pretty much PS4. Accessibility options are exemplary.Overall, this game absolutely deserves the praise it gets. 8.5/10. Some of the best map movement I've ever seen in a videogame. You can swing through New York with such speed & style that it makes normal traversal an exciting part of the game. The combat is flashy and satisfying, and the open world is decently populated with sidequests and things to, but the writing in this game has got to be some of the most atrocious I've ever seen in a piece of media. This **** is quite frankly embarrassing, and it's exacerbated by the fact that Peter never shuts up. Underneath it all is a very mechanically successful open world action game that is muddied by garbage tier writing and a poor plot premise.. Probably the best SM game i ever played on PC. Gameplay is very pleasure for player. The plot is very interesting, the combat system against various enemies is also flawless. I recommend trying to play in New Game+ mode, it's more fun.. They really nailed the gameplay here which absolutely carries the entire game A lot of your upgrades are reliant on doing repetitive side activities but because of the gameplay they're actually enjoyable to do The story is ok and the bosses are rather disappointing but I can't stress enough how good the combat and traversal are! As a game itself, this really captures the essence of Spiderman as a character, although the ending sequences seem like an excuse to make Peter suffer as much as possible I didn't really like that they crammed bad stealth sections in this game with MJ/Miles and also the introduction of Miles as a character should've been done in the second game IMO. As for the PC port it's really good, game looks great and there's no issues with running it.. I'm a **** for spider-man games. I just love swinging around new york and this one gets it right. The combat is really only so-so on this, but being spider-man brings me joy.. Really fun game with a solid story. Spiderman 2018 Remastered offered thrilling combat akin to the Arkham series, and it remained enjoyable for about 30 hours. However, it became somewhat repetitive, with a shift towards achieving upgrades and achievements. The main storyline was fantastic, but the DLCs didn't quite match it. Visually stunning with great music, the standout feature was swinging through the city. Despite minor drawbacks like repetitive side missions, it was an overall great experience.. This game is awesome. After long years waiting this is my Spiderman. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The side missions are not interesting, to evolve your character you need to pick-up things scattered accros the map which kills the flow of the game imo, the combat is fun at first, but gets dull fast especially in boss fights. Let's not act like QTE ever was a fun thing and it's a big part of this game. I think the best thing about this game is the web swinging and the story, other than that I would not play it. A blast to play through. This Is a very good game ,Spider-Man i s the best. turtleruined my entire experiance but its a pretty good game 10/10. Great game overall, MJ missions still ****.. Great gameplay and storyline, the location is quite nice and wide enough. Sad to see some little errors and crashes while playing randomly specially when the game doesn't have many bugs. Moreover, the variety of the secondary quests is very little and some of the secondary missions are boring. To sumup, it's still a great game to play but not perfect.. Fantastic game, lot of similarities with the Arkham games which is a big compliment. - combat and gameplay is very smooth, gadget usage can be optimized a bit but I never got tired about it - story and characters are 11/10, one of the best Spider-Man stories I've seen, even the lesser villains were interesting, lots of story details and cameos there and truly emotional ending - graphics also great, its not a 2023 game but still beautiful and vibrant city, a few rough edges inside the city - music is awesome, perfect Spider-Man feeling, swining around the city is a game on its own, far better than in the Batman games - easy to understand collectibles and side missions, most of them were pretty enjoyable as well - DLC content is 7/10, Hammerhead was pretty annoying and generic but the others characters were good and lots to do. Very good game, paved the way for a lot of the modern Sony exclusives. I only gave it a 9 because some missions are a little repetitive, but other than that it is a great game and I think anyone, even if they hate superhero games, should play it because it is worth their time. The main story is OK, but too much material to collect. DLC story is a waste of time.. Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered ️ 9/10 Just wanted to enjoy another playthrough before the release of its sequel, but found it still provides a top-notch gaming experience that remains unmatched in terms of quality and enjoyment to this very day, much to my astonishment.. Pretty good story and gameplay it's very fun to web sling through the city. Just wish the story was a bit longer and less fetch quest content. Amazing game, engaging combat for the most part, story is heartfelt, and perfect swinging besides the hand-holding. Looking forward to the second installment. could be a 10 but comes to a halt doing the MJ/Miles missions. Awesome game and story even if a bit short. Loved the gatgets, multiple suits, swinging. The only thing I didn't really like are the brutes or 'big ennemies' you need to punch more than others, it felt like a chore ""Ah, them again I need to take them first and then it's more fun"". But that's nitpicking, the game is very good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Bad Batman Clone. Fighting System is super lame.. played.. Greate game. Of all the PS games this is so fk boring its painful. Unlike GoW its a really poor game. Its like it gets good review only because its a ps exclusive inMarvels universe.. I love spiderman, and this game is great at portraying him, it has awesome characters and a truly amazing story, i loved the gameplay and the web swinging, combat wise im not a huge fan and there were some missions that didnt add much to gameplay/story that could've been cut, but overall, it was a great experience. Not much change compared to the original work. As a Nintendo Fan I love this game. Because I've played one of the highest rated games on here Ocarina of Time. And I have to say this is a top tier game. The Story is amazing with characters I've never heard of, such as Mr Negative with his clan the demons. The combat is spamming Control and mouse click at the same time. Which means dodge and attack. If u put music on and just play it puts you in a good mood. If you Finnish the game once just go up a difficulty level and replay, unless u picked the highest level of difficulty. With fun side missions pushing u to get 100% Anyways Great game and great story. What an amazing game.. Without a doubt the greatest super hero video game to date. Even better on PC with the ability to add mods. Just wish the remaster didn’t switch the original face model for Peter Parker. Looking forward to Spider-Man 2 coming out this October.. Spider Man Remastered brings back one of the greatest games in the PS4 gemeration and revisiting this Gem of a titel I realised it was not really worth it. I love the Spider man game the first time I played it but playing it once or twice is enough. The story is simple and not game changing. But does have really emotional and grabbing cutscenes andInsomniac really nailed by creating an original story and I cant wait to see what they do in the future. The gameplay is still as fun as always and I really think no company could ever create a better spider man game than Insomniac and this game really made me appreciate the time and love that was put in the game. Swinging through the beautifull city of New York I really got immursed into the gameplay. The combat was immersive but got really bored after a while noticing that there is no real difference for using your gadgets or just fighting with your fists. The graphics is really what makes this remaster all worth it. The gorgous sunset to the New York lights in the night and blistering sun during the day flexes the ability of what insomniac can do. The new ray tracing really brings the city to life but the 30fps really destroys the experience so its best to play performance mode but still brings an immersive experience. If you have the PS4 titel you can pay 15$ to upgrade but its really not that worth it. If you really want to revisit the world of New York before Spider Man 2 than this would be perfect but not necessary.. Fun experience, lots of joy. Loved combat especially how fluid it is. Graphics in cutscenes look amazing, you can feel the emotions from faces. It's an okay action game. If you're not into Spider-Man, it might not leave much of an impression.. Navigating the city is definitely fun, the combat is fluent, the story is good, it's a really fun game.. It's a good game, not much to say. I've played it and finished it, nothing extraordinary.. I mean it, this might be one of the best PC versions in years, runs smooth even on lower-end PC-s. First good game for Spider-Man in many years. This hero needed a game like this. A successful and fun game. PC optimization is also good.. Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. Pretty overrated. The main story and some side missions can be really cool but, for real, is not even close to being good as many PlayStation",no superhero game compares to this except the Arkham series . i have been a big fan of the Spidey for a long time but never had the chance to play the game until 2022 . i almost never give out a perfect score but spider-man deserves it .
823.Hex: Shards of Fate,"This game crashed everytime I went into deck builder (with the deck I made). I tried making a new deck and I was missing cards (that I paid for). That didn't work so I deleted the deck I had made to make another to realize that most of the cards were still gone. It was a fun game until my cards just dissapeared, the crashes, and me basically throwing money away. I dealt with the other bugs in the game, but me losing money was the breaking point.. Your always pressing yes yes yes for the next phase in PvE so many trivial bits and so little fun. The format is surprisingly boring PvE PvP is paywalled not sure if p2w as of yet dont see how one can have fun playing this but one never know this might be one of those games that are pretty fun if you willing to shell out hundreds of dollars and spend hours in theory on how to build decks. Not casual friendly. It's a good game that is Yu-Gi-Oh mixed with MTG. Which is awesome my to favorite card games but it really hurts that the only way to get descent cards is by spending $$. There is in-game currency but it goes to a Booster Pack that ONLY CONSISTS of common cards which is disgusting. The PvP is great just stay away from the Vs. Ai as the Ai will have the best hand in game to wreck you with lol and that is no joke. The first couple structure deck duels really made me stray away from the game as well as the shop it makes me feel saddened cause you have all these other great card games that are out that do the card shop so much better so this game literally gets thrown back to the shelves for later in hopes the team can maybe be a little less GREEDY with the shop.. Piece of **** game, upon dragging through the tutorial and losing the last step, I had to restart the entire thing?? text is too small. No options menu? Much of the text is too off screen to even read and It can't be fixed. Just another dumb online card game.. If the single player campaign were longer, it'd get a 10. I realize they'll release more PvE content in the future, but it'll take way too long. Anyway, this is very fun, and I enjoy it more than Hearthstone. I especially like that they included cards from old school MtG that would be considered ""overpowered."" Edit: Cannot sign in to account from Steam, which means I've lost all progress and purchased cards.. The PvP element of this game is my favorite part, specifically limited. Its relatively cheap ($5-$7) a draft and you can sell your cards on the auction house to reinvest in limited if you don't want to accumulate your cards for constructed. Its a ton of fun with a lot of good depth and interactions between cards. The newest set was just released and it seems very promising for limited.. Visually the game looks great. Lot of good visual and sound effects that really play well of the interesting card designs and features they have in the game. However, unless you have a real gaming PC your computer will not run the graphics well at all. I removed the backgrounds from the game files and it drastically improved the play speed and my enjoyment. Until they improve the optimization of the graphics and the client as a whole the graphics can only be enjoyed by those with a computer powerful enough to handle it. It's not unplayable but it can be annoying. They did add performance setting but they don't seem to do much. As a player who does not play much PVE (personal preference, I like the competitive nature of PvP games) I can only comment a little on the PVE experience. If you are coming into this expecting F2P you should be prepared for a steep learning curve. The game does not hold your hand through how the economy works so you will have to seek out the info through third party sites or the forums, which are actually very helpful as is the community in general. With all that said, if you are a fan of TCG's this game is absolutely worth your time to check out. It has much more depth and strategy than most other online TCGs or CCGs on the market and that's what keeps me coming back. I have been playing for 2 years and despite the bad things I mentioned Hex has provided me a ton of entertainment for the money I invested. If they can continue to make client and UI improvements and if the next set is good for limited it will be amazing again Note: Recently there was a bug in the auction house that charged people more than they should have been charged for items they purchased (with in game currency). Hex did nothing about it and allowed people to be scammed by the game. If you use the in game AH make sure to check outside the game on reddit, twitch, or other places to make sure it is not bugged. Note #2: They changed from being published by Gameforge to being self published. As a result they were required to wipe everyone's accounts six months after the change of publisher. They only gave a week's notice to accept the new Terms of Service instead of telling people at the time and giving them 6 months to accept the terms. The game is awesome but the company behind it seem to have no idea what they are doing.. Don't bother with this game. It is a clone of MTG but it has some serious flaws. First the game requires a lot of grinding if you play for free to try to get any cards you need to win. Second the good OP cards are pretty much unavailable now as old sets are phased out. Third, the Auction house can be hit or miss. Apparently there are fake cards for sale and if you buy one of them you can get banned from using the Auction house. Overall, a bad experience for a new player. Stay far away.. I play it As an FTP and it takes time definitely but if i would play any other MM game i would still farm more than a month to get to an good level. Hex is a really good MMTCG and if you play it enogh you can definily get good cards if you do it inteligent. With over 1,000 hours played, I can safely says Hex is one of my most played games of all time. Hex offers an excellent mix of Magic: the Gathering's complexity and Hearthstone's polish.. Have to agree this game is pretty much garbage and just another money grab game disquised by 'free to play but still a pay to win/advance game. It would take you a lifetime with the grind this game has. 1000's of matches for a paultry sum of cards at best and then those aren't really the good ones. You'll be PAYING for those with either plat pak buys or some other form of BUYing for dollars. I don't recommend this slow roller at all. Get something like Combat Monsters instead. Much faster getting what you need and the pvp is awesome.. Really fun game which for me is the important part. Love it! similar to MTGO but better at the digital part, and a lot cheaper. things to do for free and things to spend cash on when i feel like it. Will revisit my rating once multi play coop is added (they still have a ton of content they are developing on the pve side) some of these neg reviews are really funny tho... did HEX kill your mother or something?. The game itself is decent enough for a TCG. Given that there are bucket loads of games out there in the genre, having good mechanics and well thought out cards is mandatory. The game gives you that. It also gives you a campaign that is fun and addictive until you beat it a few times. You've actually got to adjust your deck for the campaign to beat certain challenges. I dig that. Makes you think beyond using the same old deck every time. You also get to wear equipment to boost certain cards, and you level up a character to give you certain perks, much like hero powers in other popular card games. Note that you only level up your character to level 9 in the campaign. There is no character devleopment outside of the campaign and you don't use campaign characters vs other players. The campaign is not finished and there is only 1 ""act"" to go through. Also, only half the classes are implemented at the time of this writing. That's all **** a week or so. Then the bad starts. You will not have enough cards from the campaign or currency, which is gold collected as you play the ai, to build a decent deck. Despite what other player's in thier community want you to believe, going into this game FTP is going to cost you weeks of time before you even get enough to get your first booster, much less play a competive deck against a human being. People will argue this to their death and point you at various **** of which I did for 75+ hours. I still have yet to have enough gold to get my first booster pack. They expect you to buy cards with the gold you earn in the campaign to progress through the latter parts of the campaign. Many of the cards you will be after cost 20 to 30k gold, while you are earning around 2k per evening. They then want you to sell cards you got in the campaign, which do not sell, because everyone wants to sell the cards from the campaign. They then want you to buy packs from other players. which currently cost around 19k gold, draft, win, open reward packs, repeat. Not feasible. Not at all. The biggest downer is the market model. You cannot spend gold directly to get _anything_ from the game. They sell everything for platinum, which is real money currency. The one and only thing gold is used for is to roll bonuses on booster packs for a chance to win extra cards....those booster packs being bought by someone else or won in tournaments of course. There is nothing in the game you can get from playing that _someone_ didn't had to pay for. Yes, you can trade on their auction house, but as a new player, expect that 98% of the cards you get in the campaign do not sell, or sell so low that it isn't even worth clicking your mouse. Why would they? Everyone is playing the campaign and already has those cards. Which brings me to the other downer. The cards you win in the campaign are not randomly drawn from all cards in the game. There is a specific set of cards in the adventure packs that are drawn from. You get the same rares based on your class/race for challenges. So expect the market to be flooded with those particular cards. They only have a bit of value if they take 10+ hours to **** I mean little value. This model of not having the game directly give players any product for the currency earned with their playtime will leave you having to replay the campaign several times and that gets damn boring. Then you might, and I say might, just come up with something that you can progress to the arena with. YOu then have to play that Arena over and over for countless hours with a deck you are bored of playing to acquire enough gold to buy packs from other players to draft with. Good luck following the guides! They all contain cards that cost at least 30k gold that you will have to buy via auction house from other players. The game is clearly built to hook you, bait you, then frustrate and bore you until you fork over your cash. I wouldn't have a problem with forking over $50-$100 for a few months of fun, but it's going to cost _alot_ more than that to get anywhere. They want MTG money. Not having a means to spend gold directly to buy boosters makes that obivous. Don't listen to thier community. They get pissy when you argue it's taking too long to get anywhere without spending money. I spent 75+ hours on this game and have been successful in many online and paper TCGs. I am not about to go and spend thousands on another one. Never again after Magic. It is not 1990 and most of us should know better than to get involved in the old TCG model of spending hundreds on cards just to continue playing. We have viable alternatives now. Living card games for paper and many many TCGs out there that reward you cards for play, with minimal investment for a tournament every now and again.. Reason why I am giving this a zero because it is just like Magic the Gathering but asking you for more money in order to do anything. It is so bad that the gold value is nothing and useless. If you want to build a good deck to do PvP, you need to put in real money to do so or you will get your butt handed to you. Because it is so strongly pay to win, I have to give this a zero. I can spend real money on a real game that won't keep asking me to buy membership.. I just change my review, now there is a poor ladder system implemented so i'll add one more point, its still pay2compete, still a mtg rip off, pve is still poor and they announced pve will be hugely delayed. the ladder system give a max of 7 pack and some gold if you reach the higer rank, you get no reward per game and if you reach the highest rank which is possible with a 35% winrate, you get nothing for playing ladder. even worse it take 3 days to reach this rank and 2 months to get reseted avoid this game at all cost, they dont want to improve.. This game is trading card game online. The game featured with role playing scenario. You can play multiplayer online with your friends. This game has several class and character for different card that can pick.. The game felt too slow, one battle takes ages. Waiting for your opponent takes minutes. This game is a Mtg rip, so I haven't seen much originality. From the positive side, they have enough players to be sustainable at least at the moment.. This is my review based on another user's comment. It's not even close to the only similarity being flipping cards side ways. It's flipping cards side ways to activate actions, flipping cards sideways to attack, you un-flip all cards at the beginning of your turn. The turn structure is exactly the same(untap, upkeep, draw, main, combat, main, clean up). Creatures are full healed every turn, hand size and drawing is the same. Deck limits are the same. Resources work the same, you can only play one resource a turn, and you can tap resources to cast spells. You can tap resources the turn you play them, but not other card types. They have the same types of cards, enchantments, artifacts, sorceries, instants. All their key words are the same(first strike, life link, trample, etc...). The way cards enter and exit the stack upon cast is the same. The colors are the same and are themed the same. The green deck is long eared humanoids that spawn more of their same type of creature, and give buffs and have effects based on the numbers of said creature. In hex long eared humanoid is rabbits, in magic it's elves. They have VERY similar power efficiency, IE a 2offense/2defense creature with an ability is going to cost the same between games. This all ignoring the super super obvious ones where the cards are exactly the same(3 mana black card called murder that destroys target creature is in both games). I don't really care which side of the argument people are on, but saying ""aside from turning cards side ways they don't seem the same at all"" shows a huge lack of understanding. To me it would be like if capcom made super street fighter two, and then some other company made super street fighter 2 turbo with redrawn sprites. That's the level of similarity between the two games.. Quite possibly the ""worst"" card game out there as far as ""grind"" goes. In a game that requires 120 gold to 1 plat and it take 500 plat to buy a pack of cards (17) and you only get a handful of gold per ""win"" in Arena battles 100 to be exact and that's if you ""win"". The scripted AI decks are hilariously overpowered vs a new player. Now maybe the Vets can defeat them easily but I could also if I had a 2 year head start. Having played Magic the Gathering for 15 years I'm just not into this grind thing or Paying to Play/Win. PVP is definitely pay to play/win unless you have a lifetime on your hands. Vets have cards a new player will have never seen before and get this they don't charge you 100 gold to play PVP they charge you 100 Plat!!! You know how long it will take a casual player playing 1-2 hours a day to get that much gold. Just to give you an example I played for 5 days and didn't even have enough gold to buy 1 plat let alone 100 plat. Now for a PVE game role playing it's ok there. You can take all the time you need to complete the campaign but be forewarned the scripted AI is pretty hard in that part of the game as well. You'll swear the cards are generater ""per turn"" vs being randomly drawn but that's pretty much what scripted is. The program seems to have a % chance that progressively goes up as you progress through the campaign that lets the player win. You're not really strategizing against the AI you're merely waiting for the % chance to come into your favor. The closer you get to the end the harder it gets to where it would seem like they only give you maybe 10% chance to win.. Never have liked scripted AI's but that's the only way devs can program a game to make it seem like it's intelligent. It's well known they've always had the ability to program an ai to beat you and beat you constantly but by cheating of course and scripting each move.. This game appears to be the one that stepped over that line whereby they make you lose more often than win and early in the game I might add. I like to have never gotten out of the last battle of the tutorial even. The starter deck is horrible and the cards you get in the campaign ain't that much better and you can pretty much forget new cards after the campaign unless you can build a deck out of trash and beat some of the veterans. They say they match you with players with alike rank and cards. Ha, I played a guy that had cards a newbie could only wish for and he was suppose to have cards like mine. Newbie cards not legendary or veteran decks. So, that's pretty much a lie about that also. I DON""T recommend this game to any ""new"" players. It's fine for a vet but new players will get crapped on for year(s) to come building up their decks and spending precious real life money to get there. Don't fall for the free word there because overall it's not free as it costs you countless amount of time and money if you really want to be competitive early.. the game is just trying to cash out. there is literally no advancment to the genre. i mean even hs has more. whether you agree with their design philosphy they at least have one that is very very different from magic. i like hs because you can just go in, enjoy and lights and sounds, play whatever card is on your curve, win and lose randomly and games go by quickly and it is just fun, besides i can play it on my ipad or phone. i even played it on a trans-oceanic flight and it was a lot of fun. but yea if you want to play competitive nail baiting games then you play magic. there is no niche that hex fills with mediocre art and user interface, poor cards and mechanics, stale meta and infrequent updates, and a tiny user base. note: the 3 score is because any ccg is better than most other games and they at least tried but with the wrong motivations or just overestimated their skill.. This is the true godsend TCG we've been waiting for. Magic has never released anything like HEX before to the online universe, though the PVE campaign is similar to their ancient singleplayer game Shandalar. Every digital card game that exists owes it to Magic yet only HEX carries the same tradition forward with innovations, complexity, and strategic depth. If you played games like Hearthstone and found them to be TOO SIMPLE then give HEX a spin. It's going to blow your mind. Please ignore the 0 rating review trolls. Haters gonna hate and Hasbro can afford a lot of haters.. When I come here and read about a game and I see a ton of 10's, I know the game is not very good then. It's just trolls trying to beef up the score and not giving the real value of the game. Therefore they turn me into one just to make the scores fair on the negative side. So, this game gets a big fat ZERO because it wouldn't surprise me none if these weren't PAID for reviews. No game gets that many 10's and the sooner everyone stops doing it and giving honest reviews the better. Including me of course but that's what they force us to do to get the right score on the screen above.. This game is certainly no 10 and it's certainly not a 0 but that's the way everyone wants to vote or the majority rather so there you have it. As far as the game. It's just Magic the Gathering with some twists. Game mechanics are the same, names have been changed on things that are sill in MTG. like Gems are land cards basically. You still have to have so many of the correct color to play the card just like in MTG does with lands. Game is a Pay game and don't let them make you think it's free cause it isn't. Not unless you want to spend a lifetime getting all the cards. Just like all the other free ones out there the gimmick is free to play but not free to compete in a fair manner. If you wan to advance fast to PVP you're gonna have to spend some money if you want to be a viable player at all. The veterans will toast you with their paid for decks.. Just another Pay to Play game folks. It's so much like Magic the Gathering I'm surprised WotC hasn't gone after them yet with a copyright suit. In fact unless you are new to the tcg or ccg it's very boring. It puts too many restrictions on deck building also. I wanted to use a card I got for this socalled FREE thing and it wouldn't let me said it was for PVP only lol what a joke. If you are a newcomer you might like it but Magic the Gathering is still the BEST tcg/ccg out there bar none. They have more cards, more players and more tournaments. Fun for everyone all the time. There also appears to be some hanky panky goin on on the forums on Steam, closing posts and deleting some very interesting ones with good information about how the game really is. Just be warned. I wouldn't buy anything if I were you. Play for free but don't fall for the trap that is called Free to Play, Pay to Advance.. Hex pushes the boundaries of what a trading card game is and can be. If you are a Hearthstone player but feel like you are just going through the motions, then Hex will allow you to explore many more different decks and strategies that you could ever dream of. If you are a Magic player, then you will be amazed by Hex's beauty and innovative mechanics. Or if you just love games, you will find in Hex an incredibly friendly community as well as a fun game that allows you to both build a collection for the future as well as casually play some games with friends or online. Here are just a few examples of what Hex does as digital card game that are either impractical or impossible for physical card games: - Card customization - in between games you can actually a card's functionality - Cards that change into other cards while in your hand - Cards that generate and add cards into your own or your opponent's deck I give the game a 9.5 out of 10, because it is still at only 95% of its potential which it is expected to realize in the next year. Install Hex, you will never look back. Good luck and have fun!. I'm a former magic player and since I discovered Hex I haven't played magic and have sold off all my magic cards. Hex is a lot like magic but much much much better. Hex is the future of tcgs, Magic is in the past!. well... the install was smooth. Unfortunately that's all i can actually review because the game simply goes to a black screen forever when i run the game. reinstalled 2 times in 2 diff **** know what i dont need to list what i did here. the game should just work , or its garbage. and this was garbage.. First of all it's magic the gathering, but slightly simpler, doesn't have the book of terms yet, still more complex then hearthstone though, I liked the idea of getting into an online magic game that wasn't ""magic online"" frankly because I hate the interface so much, and it's a crime that there is still not an auction house yet, get with the times magic, for that i refuse to play. Initially I loved the polished looking game-board, the art was fine, funny the resources looked kind of crappy though like a child's crayon drawing while waiting for a meal at Applebee's (yes exaggerating, but compared to creature art, the resources look out of place and much worse, it is NOT a big deal, but i'm just pointing out they don't look professional) The ""PVE"" almost INSTANTLY got frustrating. like it screams ""BUY CARDS SO YOU CAN BEAT THIS LEVEL YOU FAILURE"" kind of schemey, absolutely hated the PVE and quit before I even got past the first map. I realize everything can't be free, but I really didn't like that it sincrerely doesn't look like you can 'grind' out cards with ingame gold within any sort of reasonable time, unless you are a particularly crafty individual who wants to ""play"" the auction houses, buy low, sell high etc etc, you will probably take months and months to grind out a few good cards, I'm not entirely sure all the good cards are even listed for the ingame currency. and the only way to buy packs is to pay real money. unintuitive zoom function on cards (right click to zoom in on card, but it's not as simple zooming? you have to click OK then CANCEL or something stupid like that, even after I frustratingly did it several times I didn't want to grasp this awkward way to view cards and literally got confused every time I tried to zoon out up until I unistalled it (no not just for that reason, but I'm trying to explain HOW strange this feature is) TLDR looking at cards takes too long for some reason, seems like something that should have been fixed very early on. no reason for this Also had several times where l thought the game completely froze, i could have sworn it did the first time, the second time I waited it out it took a solid 20 seconds or so for the enemy AI to end it's turn. Not sure if it's an AI problem or laggy servers. this was the FIRST day I played and it happened multiple times. Ultimately I WANTED to get into this game, but it doesn't seem like much better quality then comparable games like Hearthstone or Spellweaver I just couldn't justify dropping money on the game and i'm not ""grinding"" out the cards over then next fifteen years. Already have almost 200K gold banked in spellweaver (the in-game currency you CAN actually buy packs with) after playing for only 3-4 weeks or so, didn't drop a dime on it, if you want a good Magic-like game, I would choose that over this, there is no reason to spend money if you don't have to for a extremely comparable game.. I have been playing this game since early alpha and it is hands down the best card game I have ever had the opportunity to play. The game offers both a casual approach via the pve campaign and more complexity in the pvp tournaments. There is tons of fun to be had playing around with different card combinations and new ideas whether it is against friends in the proving grounds or against opponents in tournaments. The community is friendly and there are regular community run tournaments aimed at new players. The only negative thing I have to say about Hex is that you will always want more content....come to think of it that can also be seen as a positive.. Backed this game a some years ago.. was just a TCG then. Had some nice features, but now, with the update it is actually a RPG as well. I enjoyed the campaign a lot. Hey I just want to say I love this game. It has so much potential. True, the release of new content could be more frequently and like others said, it's a diamond in the rough but when you consider the indie developers there's already a lot of content. So let's all join in, support, and make this game great!. Great game and only in digital market that have TRADING involved. Playing for long time now and i love it. Thou dev team should make spectate mode and co-op mode to play with friends! And soon!. It's terrible. Buggy, bots, disappearing cards, wonky, pay to win, short and ugly. Not as complex as Magic, not as fun as hearthstone...Although, it's a wet dream for a shy-hipster-gamer, they can safely play a game (no one will ever hear of) while suffering through a sloppy cash grab developer. **** at popular games? It's fine no will judge (or know) your secret atari-like obsession with off-off-trip A gaming. What garbage. Sad.. There are few games out there that actually make me think, fewer still that actually made me keep doing so once I had ""learned the basics"", HEX is one of those gems that had me theory crafting for hours on end, building, tearing apart, rebuilding decks as I constantly shifted things around trying to improve and discovering new combos. As it is such a massive timesink for me I have to rate it highly, however I have got to knock off a few points for the lack of technical polish and the fact that as of right now, the PvE campaign is very short, practically just the starting area (and who wants to be stuck in the starting area of an MMO)? I will no doubt revisit this review later, once things get ironed out and content is added.. I backed the game via Kickstarter and it is worth every penny... i play every spare second i have and it is, after all these years in beta, still the best game i ever had.. Hex is a full tcg with some advanced techniques, a price that is accessible and because it is relative new it has limited card pool. With this pool by now the game reach a depth no card game on the Pc has so far and I will say if its successful no other card game will reach it afterwards. I played more than 1000 hours, games like hearthstone have no chance in complexity, art, tournament play and pve, only in accessibility it shines against this one. I have to thank the designers for such a good game.. A very interesting game, but the lags both to log in, navigate menus and in-game really detract from the great game play. If the developers can match the crisp gameplay of Hearthstone, for example, it would probably be the better game. But for these types of games, its often about getting logged on, having a quick game, and getting off (i.e. convenience), and at the moment it lacks that. I am playing on an i5.. I'm a former MTGO and Hearthstone player and pretty much quit those games to play this. The core gameplay has the strategic depth **** like MTG and the digital bells and whistles **** like Hearthstone, and adds on top of it a comprehensive RPG campaign (with loot you earn and everything) not found anywhere else. Beyond that there's things like gems to socket in your cards, equipment for each card you can use to upgrade the way it work, and champions and their abilities which give birth to entirely new strategies. Oh and unlike Hearthstone it's also a full blown TCG where your cards have real world value, where you can buy and sell anything on an Auction House and you're actually investing in the game instead of throwing money into a blackhole you will never see again. The core of the game is now in and there are a ton of great new features in the horizon (they come a bit slow, but they don't sacrifice on quality to release them). Raids, guilds, crafting, multiplayer and a ton of other stuff is in the works so if you're looking to sink your teeth into a meaty digital card game, look no further, this is THE digital card game to get into.. Hex is a stellar Trading Card Game blending in elements of MMOs and RPGs in a formula that simply works. Whether you are a competitive player or a neophyte taking baby steps in your first trading card game, you will find there is something for everyone to enjoy. At its core, Hex takes much of its gameplay from card games established over the past few decades (Such as Magic, WoW:TCG, ETC), and combines the best parts of each into a fantastic package. Similar to other online card games, new players are given a stipend of 200 standard cards, enough to give the player the ability to create a basic deck for whichever character they choose to make. Players have the option to expand their collection either through purchasing PvP booster packs, or adventuring in the game's free PvE campaign to earn adventure zone packs. With $7 Drafts, an extremely rich PvE system with talent points and equipment that changes your cards, and a wonder",the format is surprisingly boring PvE PvP is paywalled . it's a good game that is Yu-Gi-Oh mixed with MTG . it really hurts that the only way to get descent cards is by spending $$ .
824.ANTONBLAST,"Very very fun game!! Every level is creative and unique, and the boss fights are so cool!!. What an incredible platformer! Surely one of the best games of 2024 I've ever played. The level design, sound designs and soundtracks, the humor... Everything is so good. I can't waitfor a sequel!. There are a few minor issues I have, but otherwise, I can definitely blame any frustrations I have with this game to my own lacking skills (as it is quite a difficult game compared to Wario Land). With good levels and controls, great visuals, funny sound design, an all-in OST, and an embracement of pure chaos, ANTONBLAST is quite a... blast!. Amazing game with amazing creators. It’s like DOOM if it was completely 2d and you get to blow up stuff. An explosively good time and a great homage to the Wario Land games of yesteryear.. Antonblast has amazing top tier visuals, graphics and top top tier level design. This game blasts so hard. I love anton and annie so much, they're so charming, unique and expressive. Only issue I have is the bosses could be more harder and there should've been a lives option as it doesn't feel that punishing dying over and over in the levels. But it's near perfect and I wish the best for summit. An amazing platformer akin to wario land 4 with a spice of crash bandicoot, the bosses feel a little weird to fight the first time but by the end of them youll be loving fighting them, every platformer fan should play this game. Truly a game that is great for people who like difficult platformers. I understand that it might not be for everyone, those who enjoy games like that will find this game wonderful. Each level is cool to learn about and has secrets which either challenge your skills or offer a puzzle which you need to solve using the games's mechanics. It is pretty funny. Definetly worth playing.. one of the best platformers I've ever played... I highly recommend this masterpiece ****! It is reminiscent of Pizza Tower, Wario and Crash Bandicoot in many aspects","a great homage to the Wario Land games of yesteryear . anton and annie are so charming, unique and expressive . each level is cool to learn about and has secrets which either challenge your skills or offer a puzzle ."
825.World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor,"best thing about it was trailer,intro was pretty good, after that boring expansion. Worst expansion for wow due to extreme lack of content. Sat in garrison and queueing raid was the experience. This game ****, you die 50 times before ever reaching level 20, its too difficult, pvp is unbalanced, terrible combat, mechanics, everything is so bad about World of Warcraft it should stop existing from earth. Honestly the first time i played it i was 12 years old, i cried in front of the boar, it made me have breakdowns, i had a terrible childhood, this game didn't make it better, today im 27 i still cry while playing it, its so bad, it makes you want to end your life.. Nevertheless it was a descent expansion with interesting world, and exploration. With NO agenda at all. And it was pretty darn fantastic, nostalgic, to the old BC times. Challenges were tough, and gave that feeling of accomplishment like MoPish were. Also great soundtrack, nice locations,. absolute garbage! Just as bad as the rest of the expansions starting with Cataclysm. Aesthetically great, but this is the beginning of the sameyness. We had three years of orcs and their black engines of war and their red, firey fortresses. Then we got three years of demons and black rocks and green lava. This is the last WoW expansion to have a banger soundtrack. This is also the first WoW expansion that is mostly voiced. There was a dearth of content in this expansion. No reputation questlines as in the prior expansion. Also no big, fleshed out capital cities. The main storyline was aborted halfway through. The lead writer left and this is when the WoW lore starts going stupid. Lots of classes were overhaulled and gutted for no reason.. Anyone who claims that Battle for Azeroth or Shadowlands are worse than Warlords of Draenor is either being a contrarian or looking through rose-tinted glasses. Warlords of Draenor was an abysmal expansion that added only two worthwhile features: new character models and the convenience of having an additional Hearthstone. There is no excuse for the disaster that is Warlords of Draenor. The only good thing that can be said about it is that because the developers decided to seemingly halt development a few months into the expansion's life cycle, they were able to pour more resources into the next expansion and give us Legion, which was a great expansion. But unfortunately, the damage had already been done, and to this day there are many who left the game and never returned. All because of Warlords of Draenor.. maybe this is just because this is the expansion that I started playing wow seriously for the first time but I loved it! I had so much fun questing and just doing stuff because it was my first full experience with wow, and I still love going back to the zones.. You know I like this Expac more then most but even I don't really care. It really does go to show that blizzard just does not know how to leave there story alone and in a good place ever.. Very cool idea of setting but in the end - weak performance for many fans of the game.. For me, this expansion gave the best memories of wow. Areas were very interesting. Full of treasures and interesting rare mobs. I also enjoyed raiding very much. Items upgraded randomly, which was cool. Shadowmoon valley was full of magic. Too bad Blizzard stopped developing this expansion (for example Farahlon never came) and started to design Legion, which wasn't imo too great and was overrated.. The worst shape WoW has ever been. Lore is a **** and only the art is on point.. great game what can I say, the only negative part about is the almost 15 months of no new content. thats why people hate on it. i had my fun!. The game publisher had a problem with their ""recruit a friend"" service. But because I didn't report it until 9 days after the friend started (instead of 7) they refused to fix it. Horrible customer service. :(. Brings us back to when the orc did not consume the fel and we get to see all the old villans and heroes of the past. WoD had everything to be one of the most epic expansions in the world of warcraft, the maps were beautiful and well crafted, the lore had potential, the raids were super cool, but the lack of content destroyed the expansion.. This is by far the last “ok” wow addon. But blizzard themselves threw it into mud. 8 just for all good things that this game has lost.. I'm editing my original 10/10 review. On retrospect this turned out to be one of the worst expansions. The raiding was good, and Tanaan Jungle was a fun zone that was added later, but the rest was a failure with tons of cut content. Not that this matters much in 2018. WoW still remains my favorite MMORPG.. Looking at this xpac after some time I can't say it was awful but it was far from good Pros + Amazing locations but not used after we done questing + Very good raids and dungeons + Leveling was pleasant Cons - Not many things to do at max lvl - A few dungeons and only 3 raids - Game was barely updated during WoD - Stingy storyline. this was so so bad really garrison during that point i wondered if this was a singe player game thats all that has to be said expect raiding that was kinda okay. Is me negative vote more strong for me... I never thing said this in any product from Blizzard with your franchise World Of Warcraft... but Warlords of Draenor... break this limit, and yes, this expansion is so bad... only save leveling, cinematic and of course new land and new visual line.... but content, news mods.... 4/10... :(. *edited* change score to reflect the quality of the expansion as a whole. Good things - Leveling/dungeons(when they were relevant) raids and new character models. Bad things - nearly everything else. tl;dr You were stuck in the garrison all the time w/ nothing to do other than to play a facebook game.. The first thing is there is no technical support at all. Tickets is the only way to contact them if you have an actual problem. They will acknowledge the problem and do nothing about it. They have built a system to shield themselves from the customer while they provide no support. The game areas now are very small and to fix this they do things like take away flying to ""make it more immersive"" meaning we built a small area being lazy and this is how we are trying to combat it. You can unlock flying but its a long achievement to do so once you do this you realize how small the new areas really are. Since prepatch for legion the servers are plagued with crashes and resets almost everyday. During this the raids. dungeons, and quests reset randomly sometimes. Which Blizzards reply is ""well keep trying it"". This game could still be good but apparently they have gone the route of provide little content and get as much out of the consumer as they can. They now also sell mounts and pets you cannot get in the game for a bigger cash grab.. This abyssmal abomination of an expansion has sapped my desire to log in. My only reason for playing the game anymore is to spend time with my friends who still do. I log in to raid with them and between raid nights, I play just about any other game I know. This expansion has sapped my enjoyment from the game so much that I haven't even been keeping up on the next expansion because I just don't care enough, anymore. I also have very low expectations of Blizzard at this point.. I played WoW hardcore for its first six years and loved it. It began to really slip for me after Lich King and now is just a shell of itself. They have really mailed-in everything about it - not improving the graphics, the talents and progression are actually worse, and the quests are so bland and copy pasta it is ridiculous.. This is hands down one of the worst experiences with WoW and a terrible expansion. Okay, let me start off with the pros, there are only a few. -Draenor is a beautifully done continent, and they all feel unique and different in scope and scale, it's amazing what the art team can up with for an old engine based of the one from Warcraft 3. -The sound design is amazing as well. The music score is well done as well, very good tracks and catchy tunes. -The 90-100 leveling experience is amazing and all the quests are really good. Alright, with those out of the way, let me talk about what was terrible. The end game content is scarce and there is no variation. Dailies are made into apexis grinds, which are monotonous and boring. Dailies have always been kind of a mixed bag, but these take the cake in really being absolutely awful. Two raid tiers, three raids, is unacceptable, Blizzard. Also, after you've done the leveling once, there is little incentive to go back through it again, as there is no variation in the way, it's extremely linear, and going through with an alt is extremely tedious and you'll get sick of going through the 5 leveling zones a second time. Tanaan Jungle is absolutely terrible and comprised of all the same crappy end game apexis dailies and boring rep grinds. Again, there is no variation. The Garrison. It was promising at first, but it turned into a **** facebook simulator, with followers that do more content than you, the garrison campaign missions are boring as well, and the garrison invasions are completely dumb and also offer no variation with every type. Getting materials is easy now and the AH is not a good place for mining and herbalism anymore. The daily CD on certain materials was also a terrible idea. Not to mention the cut content for the garrison, it is honestly lost potential. Which is also the basis for the entire xpac, lost potential. Ashran is garbage as well, PvP objectives are dumb and it's a less fun version of Wintergrasp without the vehicles, which might I add were also going to be included? And then Faralhon was just cut from the xpac entirely, what the heck, Blizzard? The dungeons are okay, but there is little reason to do them after one heroic run each. There is so much smoke and mirrors, bring old dungeons forward is NOT content, Blizzard. Not to mention the overall unprofessionalism of the dev team, dodging reasonable concerns and so much damage controlling, especially over adding good content, people complaining about the lack of said content, and confusing class nerfs that were unfounded. This was overall just a very poor experience. It's not the worst thing ever, and it wasn't unplayable, but the amount of cut content and missed potential, as well as the behavior of the devs, I can't give it a higher score than 5/10. Legion looks promising, and it seems like Blizzard is learning from their mistakes, so hopefully that will be amazing.. Over the last expansions Blizzard managed to take out every aspect of the game that made it once great. WoD is the pinnacle of that process and while in MoP and Cataclysm I had at least some fun while leveling, with WoD that was also taken from me. They lured us by promising a retro like experience and more challanging content. What we got was the most dumbed down content ever. Every major quest line instanced, easy to kill raremobs everywhere, no social interaction needed for anything, mandatory garrison farming all day every day. Again I believed their lies at Blizzcon and tolerated their arrogant behavior towards the fanbase. As I stated in my D3 review i feel betrayed by a company that delivered the greatest video game of my era and by that i mean the original World of Warcraft. The insolence of selling WoD for almost 200% of BCs selling price back in the day, and then haveing the least content of all expansions, indicates that Activision-Blizzards priority is to milk the rest of the customers as far as possible before there are none left. I cannot understand why anyone would consider buying Legion while they continue to ignore the player bases outcry. Sadly it seems that Blizzard itself is the ""WoW-Killer"" and not any competitive product.. This is the best WoW expansion of all time. The garrison missions are a blast, the pet battles are fun, and everything is just great! It is much better than Vanilla WoW.. Been playing WoW from day **** I can not believe I have given so much of my time (and money) to this game. Not saying it in a bad way, just an amusing observation. WoD though, I thought it was an interesting concept. Go back in time to before Outland/Draenor got wrecked. Story arc was interesting and engaging for me, but still all about yo-yo quests. you know, the ""go there, come back. go over there, then come back. Oh, you know that place you left three hours ago? **** there and come back again."" But that's to be expected. My main issue with WoW pretty much since Burning Failure is the bloody dailies. They pretty much make playing the game a second occupation. Rep grinds, crafting material grinds, just grind after grind after **** none of it meaningful. Just busy work for the sake of distracting you from the fact that Blizzard really, if you think about it, didn't give you much in this expansion. Content-wise....they basically gave you enough to do to hit 100 in a day. Yes, a single day folks. I know because I did it. 7 times. what does that tell you? At that point....guess what you are left with? Grinding. Or going to finishing quests for gold. Either way...a grind. Now Blizzard says they will start putting out an xpac every year instead of every 2-3. What will that solve if you barely give us anything meaningful to do to begin with? I literally spent more time running all my toons back through old raids for transmog gear than I ever did doing the actual content in **** found it MORE fulfilling. Listen to your players **** keep ignoring us much longer and we might just leave to go play Age of Conan.. WOD is most definitely the worst WOW expansion; in fact it fails on epic proportions. The game honestly felt more hollowed and players were more isolated than ever before. Do not trust any of the positive reviews as they are extremely biased and mostly made by fanboys. I was once a devoted Blizzard fan until CATA. Since CATA WOW has continuously been gutted and replaced with nothing. Wow failed to deliver on all promises. Also, Blizzard transitioned their forums to Twitter. That's right.. Twitter. So, rather than reporting issues on their very own forums...... you report them to the Twitter Dev account. Players and MVP's came out of the woodwork to complain about this irrational decision, but Blizzard showed no care. Furthermore, Blizzard lacked any communication with the pvp community for the first 3 and a half month before Lord responded. However, it was a once sentence response then complete silence. This game is literally hollow (not even kidding about that) and it feels like an early alpha staged game that offers decent MS. It feels less complete than the beginning of WOTLK. Blizzard said they had a staff of 100+ people working on WOD, but it did not seem that way. In comparison FFXIV had a third of that workforce and they came out with a great game and continue to create far better content, ideas, raids, the list goes on. WOD is a waste of time and money and I highly recommend you to NOT play this game at all.. Low content, bad end game, Ashran, pay more for less. This expansion is very disappointing on the Pve side and pvp side. No new battlegrounds or arenas. Only 9 DGs and 3 raids.. This expansion is nice at first but after a while the game becomes a second job. You log on, and start doing the garrison grinds: mines, garden, profession buildings work order, Apexis crystal dailies, battle-pet dailies, shipyard missions etc... after you finish all that grinding, you move on to older content grinds: reputation, mounts, achievements ....etc. PvP is also very grind-y. dungeons are cool, they are certainly better than MoP dungeons. But raids are not that fun actually. The idea of Garrosh creating an alternative timeline doesn't offer much in terms of lore and story telling. It felt like Blizzard has run out of ideas and is just recycling old stuff, and they confirmed that with timewalking dungeons. It strikes me as very strange that after all those years WoW's graphics is still pretty much the same cartoonish clumsy look. The music is great as always The over-all feel of the game now is very stale and boring.. This game is garbage. It is sad to see a great game become nothing more than a cash cow. They literally ran out of ideas, so you know what they came up with to occupy players' time? Flying. Wow. That's it. Flying. You have to spend an entire month at least just grinding, exploring, and doing useless dailies in order to fly. Other than that, there is nothing to do anymore.. Many aspects go into making an MMORPG great and Blizzard is no stranger to putting out quality products winning numerous awards for various games and making more money than any of us can imagine. When first starting from level 90 and venturing off into Draenor, you find yourself helping a group of characters destroy the Portal which was built to breach the gateway between Draenor and Azeroth. From here you have to progress through each zone all while building up your army of allies to ultimately defeat the group that tried to invade Azeroth. Single Player Gameplay The single player content with this game contains basically two things: Leveling up through the zones and your Garrison. At first glance the sound of having your own ""town"" that you can control people and buildings may intrigue you, but we will get back to that in a minute. The leveling up process through Draenor is fantastic. The zones are designed with progression in mind from one location to another and there always is a bread crumb trail for you to follow to easily find your way. The implementation of Rare mobs and treasures made each zone more fun and exciting because you could pick up extra equipment to make yourself stronger. You'd also be able to find and unlock followers on your adventures which would assist you with duties in your Garrison. The garrisons are set up in 3 levels, with each level unlocking as you grow in level and progress through the game. Each level offers more of a variety of buildings to help with professions, resource gathering, follower requirement, daily quest hubs and even PvP. At first you'll be extremely excited about this because you will have most everything at your finger tips, but you soon realize that all you do is log on to your character, do your garrison ""stuff"" and then log off because there is nothing else to do for end game content. The Mine and the Herb garden utterly destroyed gathering professions because you didn't need to have either one to obtain materials needed for crafting. This also hurt the economy because this now wasn't a viable way to make any gold. Professions were gated now behind a daily cooldown building in your garrison that you needed to make certain items. On top of that any secondary stats (Mastery, Mutlistrike, Haste, Versatility) that you were given from the items were completely randomized. The follower mission table was just that, you basically became the quest giver and sent your followers out on missions. You don't get to do the missions any more, they do. This now became the primary way of making money in Warlords of Draenor because with little effort you could send your followers out and they'd bring you back gold, experience and even loot from raids. The shipyard addition in 6.2 would just end up being another mission table. This made end game solo content, basically non existent. Multiplayer The multiplayer for Warlords of Draenor for the most part was well designed in terms of the Raids and Dungeons. The raids, if you were able to do them on the higher difficulties offered a variety of challenges that required a high amount of teamwork along with personal skill and accountability. The dungeons were well designed for first hitting level 100, but grew tiresome quickly with the fact that there were only 8 dungeons to choose from, one of which was a rehash from Vanilla WoW. There weren't any new dungeons added, only harder difficulties and timewalking which is just a rehash of old dungeons from all the previous expansions. PvP is a joke, no new battlegrounds or Arenas were added and Ashran, which was supposed to be like AV or Wintersgrasp, actually felt more like PvE with a group of people rather than Actual PvP with objectives. Its insanely easy to get gear up for PvP and doesn't offer any incentive to keep doing it. The overall story of the game is rather convoluted and you can see the end product was changed and rushed. Without giving away any spoilers, the end boss isn't who you think it should be. Normally Blizzard puts a lot more time and effort into their stories and is one of the reasons their games are so popular, that's why it's so painful to see how poor this one was written. Graphics and Sound The art style and attention to details by Blizzard's art team are superb. You can really see all the hard work that went into each zone and all the new characters, weapons and armor. Although it may not be perfect, it is probably the best part of this expansion. The sound via music and voice acting was also top notch. TL:DR Overall the game is average at best and to me deserves a score of about a 4 (the art and music bumps the overall score to a 5) . If you are able to raid, you will find it fun for a few months, but even then all you will find yourself doing is logging on to do garrison ""stuff"" and raiding. Here is to hoping Blizzard learns from their mistakes for Legion!. I pre-ordered this expansion thinking that I will give the franchise one last chance after the disappointment of the previous one (MoP) and the one before (Cata). This time round I did not even have the morale to bring my character to the level cap. The game treated me as a super hero more than any of the previous expansions. The game has pretty much turned into solo game play. The immersion is gone. There were two reason why I gave MoP 2 points in my review. One point for the remnants of the original game still present and one for the friends still present in the game. Both are pretty much gone now. There is nothing interesting for an RPG fan anymore. The game may have positive aspects for other players that are into numbers, daily tasks and gear treadmill. But I personally see the present WoW model as a poison to the gaming industry rather then a valuable addition. The sooner the MMO genre moves away from this unhealthy model of Facebook/FarmVille games, the better for everyone involved. Sadly Blizzard is reducing this franchise into just that and nothing else.. worst expansion to date. this was worse then cataclysm for me....please make it end...legion im waiting for you very soon i hope!!the only thing good about wod was the soundtrack i love it :). This expansion had awesome beginning quests and all other quests in all other zones but not implementing Tanaan Jungle at the start and then making it just Apexis Crystal **** farm this is a big fail. Raids are **** slow, you give more time to kill trash than boss in Hellfire Citadel and there are many unused places. This expansion looks like if world of warcraft became free.. + raids + flex raiding + garrison missions that can make you goldcap in notime + visuals + catch-up mechanics - professions are irrelevant... and constrained by time, not your grind capacity - even more painful RNG - legendary grinding I usually stick around if the grind and RNG is somewhat balanced out by content. for me there's no content outside PvE - be it 5man or mythic raids. while i'm not happy with dungeons (they become irrelevant very quickly), this time around raids are simply amazing. still keeping subbed only because of those 3 nights in a week; outside of it - it's a **** boring xpack. I say low content and the Garrisons are making people addicted to stay there and they killed the on-line community with them. But the game is still strong and easily can make u addict. I can say only one thing Legion will better than this expansion I hope more content will come to Legion but WOD only get 8.0 because low content and pvp got 0 new stuff.. got to laugh about the reviews where people are complaining they are bored of the game after playing for ten years lol instead of whining, just stop playing or is it that you secretly dont hate the game, just you are upset that you secretly do still love the game? yeah, garrison is not great but from my 9 level 100's only 3 have level 3 garrisons, you do realise you can still raid, quest and dungeon without playing the garrison don't you? my main gripe is how dumbed down a lot of the game is now **** its a big but..... i have no progress on mythic raiding so maybe I'm a little dumbed down too :D I can't complain a games too easy when I haven't beaten the harder aspects of it. Overall, nice updates graphically, sound has always been good, story is told well (if you read the quests) and lots of different classes to play with. Balancing has and will always be an issue but most people in my experience who freak about it are normally the people who aren't very good despite the class they choose. The expansion was mostly fine in the beginning (aside from the terrible launch), the questing and leveling experience was very engaging, definitely the best one so far. However once you hit level cap, there's very little to do outside of raiding. PVP also got the short end of the stick and arena participation was at lowest it's ever been.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The raids are fantastic and the new zones are beautiful. Worth trying. Shipyard and garrison features were really unappealing and did not feel like part of an MMORPG. There is simply not enough content to justify ongoing subscription.. + Leveling experience was better than in MoP (but that is not much since it was so bad in MoP) - Everything in Garrison is stupid - Followers - PvP is worse than ever - Professions, Mining and herbalist why these are there anymore? - Dungeons, only reason to do these are achievments - Ashran, worst world BG so far (and it has little to nothing to do with real World PVP) - World PVP, even with the no flying this did not happen, with all those stupid buffs and stuff they added + that there is not much ppl outside garrisons other than some random people farming Barn things. - Classes, about every class is much less fun to play compared to MoP or any other expansion or vanilla, especially i dislike how Warrior and Druid are now very easy and simple and much less fun to play compared what hey were pre mop.. This expansion is a mixed bag, and definitely shifts the focus away from people who enjoy raiding content. Warlords of Draenor is an expansion that focuses on world content and activities, most of which are centered around your Garrison. This shift of focus has largely alienated those who enjoy hardcore raiding, and profession balance has been upset by the new Garrison mechanics, but I would say that if you enjoy WoW for it's exploration and world content; then WoD should be very enjoyable to you. As for the profession problems, Blizzard has made a lot of questionable changes, however professions are still very viable gold makers for the people who adapt to the changes, rather than becoming a sniveling mess over the features that daddy (Blizzard) took away. Personally, I was formerly a hardcore raider during Wrath, and after a few years off since the Cataclysm expansion disaster, I came back looking for a more casual and relaxed experience that didn't depend much on raiding. and that's exactly what I found in WoD.. I absolutely love the WoW franchise and this especially was worth every penny. The story rocked the house down, the graphics like always were outstanding and the new features were fabulous. The new mounts were awesome and the new land Draenor was something I've never seen before. This was definetely a success. Go buy it NOW.. An improvement on the previous expansion in my opinion, as the new story and content for levelling is much more enjoyable and in line with more traditional WOW lore. The continued ""casual"" additions are ok in terms of dungeons and now raiding, however garrisons additions are lacklustre and not particularly fun.. They really dumb'd down last couple expansions, especially this one.. the follower missions are pretty useless and distractions, plus more pet games, why all the added mini-games to the series? .. they really need to return to expanding questing and dungeon content, not mini-games!!!! it's gone from an adult flavored game to an adolescent gaming experience... the zones are getting more and more linear.. ugh. feels very hurried and sloppy.. WoW isn't WoW anymore. It's a tablet game. MoP took you beyond the horizons of Farmville. Now, experience Clash of Clans! The most boring parts of it, anyway. In fact, it's become like a Facebook app. You can even... hee-hee! Take selfies! You also get raiding. Lots of raiding. In fact, that's all you get, other than missions. Lots of missions. The questing in this expansion was terrible. Beyond bland. The story was a bit ludicrous, and even at launch, I thought it was a bit much. Going back in time? Why, so you can lead up to another BC expansion just to pull back your BC subscriber base? Issues with this expansion that will never be fixed: Lack of content-- garrison and raids is all you get once you hit 100; the raids are boring rehashes of other raids; the garrison ruined the economy; the community is still awful; the classes are ridiculously dumbed down and unbalanced; the essence of WoW is now replaced by Facebook/tablet game content; professions are now pointless; even collecting things like mounts is boring and too overbearing now; grinding all the reps is so tiring, and I'm getting so sick of reputation farming in every release; glyphs are useless; you have to buy a garrison on every toon and it doesn't get sped up for anyone; those talent trees are still horrible. With each expansion, the game becomes drastically different from the last, making each release a completely different game. This one took the cake. It's now WoW. It's a tablet game emulator. They're just copying and pasting what's popular and so many people are falling in love with it. I don't get it. I don't find Facebook apps fun. I don't find games just like them any fun, either. So what did I like about WoD? -No flying. I liked that I got to use my ground mounts for once. -New character models. Some were better, and some were worse. But the attacking and running animations were a bit more fluid. -Ultra rare mobs drop something for everyone in the group. If you all kill a rare mob that drops a mount, you all get that mount. Um… except for when you kill Nok-Karosh, who only drops one single mount for an entire raid of people who have to roll Greed on it. Sigh. Never mind, it's terrible again. -The instant character boost that came with buying the expansion. You know, so you can be terrible and be max level at the same time. -Um… Pepe? This was the expansion that did it for me. I already didn’t like MoP very much. In fact, I hated it (except for when Timeless Isle was released). I saw a lot of potential in WoD, and it let me down in the worst possible way. I thought it would be coming back from the grave, but it only dug its hole deeper. To me, WoW is dead now. I’m not interested in Legion, and I don’t even care about their store items anymore. Sure, once in a while, I see WoW as an ex-lover that I abruptly broke it off with, and every once in a while it’ll try calling me in the middle of the night to try to win me back. But I’ve had my fond memories, and I’ve had my good times. I’d rather hang onto them while I still have them rather than insult them by giving WoW the attention it so badly craves, like a screaming, whining child begging for candy.. It's easily the worst expansion of world of warcraft. No improvements at all. They've cut so many useful elements out of the gam","the first time i played it i was 12 years old, i cried in front of the boar, it made me have breakdowns . this is the last expansion to have a banger soundtrack . this is also the first WoW expansion that is mostly voiced ."
826.Turbo Overkill,"GOOD SIDE -Comfortable character control and fast fighting system. -A story that does not take itself seriously is an aspect that makes me happy. -Boss battles are good. -Level design diversifies and develops in later sections. -You can shape your play style with the new cybernetic and weapon modes that open. -Beautiful music. BAD SIDE -Level design is shallow at the beginning. -The feeling of hitting is weak. -Some weapons are both weak and meaningless. -The visuals sometimes hurt your eyes. According to 2025. This game is like low budget doom. I liked it but after a while it gets repetitive and boring.. Hits hard, with killer gameplay and legit boomer shooter gunplay that reminds me of what the genre is all about. I don't play these games for the story or the visuals - I play them for the fun factor, and Turbo Overkill (for the most part...) excels. Episode 1: 10/10 Episode 2: 7/10 Episode 3: 3/10 Might just be an example of too much being a bad thing, but by the time I hit ep3 I was kinda over it. Levels are all a bit long and my god these final boss fights are rough, with punishing lack of checkpoints etc. Still I'd say the fights are fun as hell, with all the movement tech the game provides coupled with furious guns blazing. Worth a play. Just be prepared to wonder how long the ride is going to last. Oh and why the fk is there a sniper in a retro shooter? And why in the fk are there multiple segments dedicated to it?. I have not finished this game but I just really felt I had to say a few things about it.This is one of the greatest examples of what a small new studio with a brand new IP and a very limited budget can do when time and opportunity is given to people with incredible talent and video game design understanding. I have played so many shooters from huge AAA titles to AA to indies and truly very few can come even close to how this game is managing to capture the old school boomer shooter aesthetic while at the same time looking super modern and have amazing graphics. The combat is just so fast, so satisfying with some of the most spot on sound design and fps mechanics I've ever experienced.. It is the most fun I've had in a very long time plain and simple nothing more to it.. Really fun boomer shooter, where every weapon is fun to shoot, the enemies are varied enough to be interesting and the arena levels are okay. Level design is very poor, sadly, with unclear directions and it' frequently difficult to understand what the game wants from you. The ammo and health distribution is also an issue, there is no reliable way to get these from the enemies, unless they are fodder enemies. So it's not quite Doom Eternal level combat and some opponents fall into the bullet sponge category, but that's a small issue, since the game provides really fun weapons to engage with them.. Amazing retro style FPS. Hadn't had a fill of adrenaline like this since I finished Doom Eternal. Super recommended game!. Turbo Overkill AKA Chainsaw Man The Game 10/10.. Haven't had this much fun since ULTRAKILL and DOOM Eternal. The game looks amazing despite it's pixelated models, and the gunplay feels amazingly fun. When people say ""Chainsaw Man"", the first thing that comes to mind is Turbo Overkill.. I won't say much but this is a must play for DOOM and old FPS shooters enthusiasts , great gameplay and environment style, good movements, a generous selection of enemies, and to top it all, banger music. Try it out, it is a lot of fun.. The chainsaw leg mechanic is one of the best mechanics I have ever seen in a video game. Sliding around chopping enemies up at Mach 10 with your chainsaw leg never gets boring. The game itself is excellent, from the incredibly solid shooting to the level design and music that pumps you up during different arenas. My only big gripe is that the bosses are kinda of bad and made redundant with the turbo time ability which makes every single boss in the game a piece of cake. Other than that it's an incredible game. Very fun game with a great aesthetic. Fast and slick combat. It goes on for too long (in particular the ending) and the story is not especially well-written, but overall very enjoyable. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. God this is the fastest game I've ever played and it's also a shooter which is a big plus for me. There are excellent levels where you can fly in a car, ride a motorcycle and run on furs. But there are also obviously unfortunate disadvantages that lead to a lengthy narrative, which is the main disadvantage of the game, this is protractedness. And so, the experiment is successful and even with great music.. AMAZING that this was done with so little money and people.. Amazing and underrated boomer shooter, great music and cyberpunk asethetics, huge viertical urban decayed maps. Also you have a chainsaw in your leg, what more do you want?. Honestly one of the best first person shooters I've ever played period. It's so outrageous and over the top almost all of the time, superb soundtrack, sublime gunplay, great level design and somehow it just gets better and better the more you play. For the price you cannot go wrong, truly excellent.. Excellent and very underrated boomer + story-shooter. Similar mechanics to Doom Eternal or Ultrakill with it's own unique art- and visual style set in a depressing Cyberpunk/Blade Runner world named Paradise. As a street cleaner, your job's well... cleaning the city of the so called Syn virus. The story is good enough and becomes really interesting over time. The game is divided in 3 chapters, all underlined with its varied gameplay passages and levels in each of them. Clean movement and shooter mechanics with cleverly designed guns, all fitting for different situations are building up to a solid gameplay foundation. Paired with a chainsaw leg you will find yourself dominating a large horde of enemies while listening to the banging soundtrack surrounding it. Upgrades for components of your body can be bought and applied along the purchase of a secondary gun mode for each one. Thanks to the well thought out level design, the game always keeps feeling fresh with new ideas, armory and gameplay passages. All in all, a great game with the only flaw being the music banging 24/7 instead of only in fights, making it feel more like background music. Give this game a go, if you like other fast paced shooters, or shooters in general! Great game!",this game is one of the greatest examples of what a small new studio with a brand new IP and a very limited budget can do . it captures the old school boomer shooter aesthetic while at the same time looking super modern and have amazing graphics .
827.Halo Infinite,"Less than 9, you're crazy.. A Return to the Franchise’s Glory Days - Halo Infinite is a stunning revival of the franchise’s finest moments, capturing the essence of what made Halo legendary. It brings back the magic of classic combat, iconic visuals, and a narrative focus on Master Chief while introducing innovations that elevate the experience. Gameplay - The gameplay is masterfully crafted, offering the best of Halo’s signature sandbox combat. The addition of the grappling hook adds a dynamic element to exploration and battles, allowing players to approach challenges creatively. The balance between nostalgia and modern mechanics ensures both longtime fans and newcomers feel right at home. Graphics - Visually, Halo Infinite is a marvel. The world of Zeta Halo is beautifully detailed, with expansive environments, rich textures, and impressive lighting that evoke the grandeur of the franchise’s early days. It’s a visual love letter to the series' legacy while leveraging the power of modern hardware. Open World - The move to an open-world format is a bold and successful evolution. It recaptures the sense of wonder and freedom found in the original Halo while offering new opportunities for exploration, strategic planning, and discovery. From hidden collectibles to enemy bases, every corner of Zeta Halo feels alive and rewarding. Story and Ending - The story brings the spotlight back to Master Chief and introduces ""The Weapon,"" a new AI companion, creating a dynamic relationship that drives the narrative. While the overall plot is engaging, the ending feels somewhat incomplete, leaving threads that could have been more conclusively tied up. However, it sets the stage for future installments. Conclusion - Halo Infinite is a brilliant return to form, combining the best elements of the franchise’s history with modern enhancements. It’s a celebration of what made Halo great, while paving the way for a bright future. Although the ending could be improved, the game stands as a must-play for fans and a shining example of how to honor a legacy. Score: 9.5/10. terrible launch and lying about features. Just put out a complete game. Even if its good now it was not good for over a year. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 10/10 masterpiece! The gameplay is great andthe graphics are stunning! Definitely my top 5 best game. اهاIt's amazing if there weren't some flaws in the game like mobility andThe affected enemies.. Haven’t had this much fun in halo since 3/Reach, great game overall. Especially pleased with the multiplayer portion of the game.. It's a great game. I highly recommend it. It has a lot of action, its mechanics are very good, the story line is very solid and of course the master chief is great.. While the story is back at its core strength, its not the masterpiece we come to know and love.Thats said, Master Chief is back, and with style!. Halo Infinite has srobably the BEST gunplay in any fps game ever. The story is good, the graphics are good, and the frame rate is flawless.. I really enjoyed the environment and the mechanisms for traversing the world Halo Infinite presents. However, the action was quite repetitive and i was board after the first hour. Additionally, having not played any of the former Halo's (single player) i was not familiar of the backstory of Master Chief and Cortana, which I found myself complete lost and therefore unengaged with the Halo Infinites plot.. The campaign was fun but the online was lacking. Having permanent political statements on the front page of the online didn't help. Take politics out and focus on the game.. solid 9/10 campaign with a few stupid nerfs and missing features i liked the multiplayer too unlike what twitter says lol. and it seems the vast majority of people do too as mp has a very positive review on steam with 250k plus reviews. negatives are no flood & cut content like sangheilios. A remake of Halo 1 not so good as Halo 5 Guardians...i was expecting something more...Guardians was the best imho for the xbox one/series x **** well maybe next time. I get the hate, i get the critisism, but this game is fun. The multiplayer is far better and more fleshed out than many boring online FPS's. And the campaign while repetitive is very fun. The combat is smooth and fast ,and extremely fine tuned. The grabble hook is the cherry on top of all of it. I liked the game but the game but the open world killed it. Graphics are good but the story ouch.. I like it. Old school halo fan. Halo ce was the first game I played online. Mostly enjoyed campaigns and got in too halo 3 online. This is different but I like it. Online actually feels the same with some tweaks but find everyone plays a match like old halo. It's not too different with slides and graples ect. Match making bit slow and haven't experienced much map variety which is a bummer but overall fun and the only game I can say that about when it comes to online. (Not one for multiplayer) I dobt pay attention to microtransactions although there is a ridiculous amount but easy too ignore. Campaign was enjoyable story wasn't too bad a welcome reboot after halo 5 for sure. Could be better but I did really like the way it played and the boss encounters, the unlocks and progression was good too me. Chief is a slight bit too talkative in this. Not by much but he could always get the point across in the least amount of word that's what the character was and in this it was few words but somethings don't have to be said by chief. My opinion that is. Overall good and definitely areas to improve. Halo infinite was a let down, comparing it to the other games in this franchise. Halo Infinite seems to be Xbox games studios trying to push an exclusive to the console to gain an edge over Sony. The story of the game seems very “rinse and repeat”. Filled with constant room clearing missions, and annoying sections with overwhelming amounts of enemies and barely any cover to protect yourself. The multiplayer seems like they’re just pushing multiplayer as a marketing buzzword for the players to notice and get excited. The game features a battle pass, as expected, and features skins and whatever else they can use to rinse the pockets of players. The gameplay of multiplayer is quite fun, and the game modes seem very unique from eachother and give me a reason to play each one of them.. good but I'd like if getting into matches was faster. the games takes a bit too much time to load compared to bf1 or apex.. Absolute garbage. Can’t even play matches anymore. Uninstalled this abomination **** and decided to spend my time doing better stuff like playing guitar.. Fun game with good story mode online mode got boring fast though graphics took a massive hit as well also 343 industries lied about story dlc so that's a negative. Dont know how its rated so high… but this game has great mechanics but **** working on it. They dont give it any love, matchmaking is horrid ans cheaters are rampant. The game workers do nothing at all other than making crap battle passes and crap maps. If it wasnt for the community, this game would be dead. I wish that 343 would do anything… simply anything, cuz this game has the greatest of potential, but a USELESS company running it.. Better than people make it out to be. But, overall, is very disappointing and lacking in all departments. Gunplay doesn’t feel responsive and snappy while graphics seem washed, and make it difficult to see enemies. The campaign is unique and refreshing, but executed poorly. It’s hit or miss whether you like it or not.. some of the worst network/hit reg i have ever seen. campaign is the least replayable, the grappling ruins level design and most missions feel the same. sandbox is kinda fun. When it isnt lagging or having weird network issues, its a solid shooter. Nothing groundbreaking. Hopefully halo never does a live shooter again.. Story is really good Probably the best story Sense Halo 3. The open world's fun for the first couple hours, but it begins to get the bland After a while. The game plays the same as every Halo game Except for the graphling hook which I really like. I haven't played the multi player much but what I played was fun. But Microsoft has been f****** it up a bit.. Boring story, all is the same (open world is only for GTA, Halo is for single missions) everything is UNSC, UNSC, where is an elite story mode? Damn microtransactions, NO PLAYABLE ELITES, not being able to select the colors you want in multiplayer, multiplayer maps are all humans, no variety of ANYTHING with 343 Halo has been bulsh/t, bring back the playable elites, bulsh/t 343. the open world added to the story of Halo is nice... different from the other games, no interest in multiplayer but the campaign was good... A really goodlooking and playeble Halo. The OW is awesome and is a masterpice in the HAlo universum. Really poor addition to what was a great series. Multiplayer is broken and the maps are just not fun. The campaign…I don’t know where to start! It just doesn’t hit like the others. An iconic Xbox mascot dragged through the dirt and ruined.. This game have all to be one of the best, but incompetent decisions of 343 and Microsoft kill it. such a shame to have a game with awesome potential and throw it to the garbage with **** ass micro transactions. After Halo Guardians, it seems they came back to what was good about Halo. Decent story, really fun to play. Perfection This game is just amazing Whether It's The amazing multiplayer or the spectacular story this game is just perfect play it NOW. Very classic, but not in a good way. A bad COD unfortunately. No originality, graphically not ugly but not cute either.. Great game. I play multiplayer mostly and I think 343 have made a great version of Halo.. Pure fun like the good ole days. Would love campaign updates. I like swinging from the grapple.. From The down fall of Halo 5, this game really give you hope that there is still more for the chef waiting. Halo infinite brings the best parts of Halo back to life in a epic open world fill with objectives and new exclusive weapons. The story feels off and not that good with addition like the Endless which really takes the spot light off the flood. The game really brings you back to the first game with that old Masterchef look that you take resemblance from Halo 2 and 3. This is a great reminisce of the original game the Bungie put to order and an expansive world to go with.. They definitely fixed the issues they had with the story in the previous games. Also, the Multiplayer is as fun as ever and free!. **** this game. This is a horribly executed way of making money. This game is almost as bad as Halo 5. Which is almost impressive. 1/10. Easily one of my favorite halo games, the campaign is one of my favorites, and the last time I played a multiplayer for any game this much was back on halo 3. Had a rough launch, but the movement in this game feels so amazing.. game is not bad but for me is the worst of the series, story is not so good. I was expecting a turning point then the game ended leaving me with bitter taste. open world is a little boring. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's such a shame that such a good foundation has been completely abandoned. The current 'season' is just a single meme mode as far as I can tell. Player counts dwindling... What happened? The campaign is pretty lame, but the weapon is one of my favorite AI waifus don't me.. Missing lots of content at launch, took a year and a half to get to the state it should have been, but we finally have a complete game. Campaign is a good play the first time around, but after that, the flaws start to show. Art style is closer to the original trilogy, which but feels like it's at the expense of the graphical fidelity that 4 and 5 brought to the franchise. Don't expect a masterpiece, but it's still a great new addition to the Halo franchise, especially the multiplayer.. As a co-op shooter, the game simply has no competition in this form. It may not be the best part of the series and open world is simply not for Halo, but the gameplay and gunplay are still absolutely top class. The game is so much fun in coop and graphics and sound are really good.. Best multiplayer ever. Addictive and beautiful. Great campaign. The future of Halo is bright. It can only go up from here.. Captures the essence of classic Halo with a modern twist. Needs more depth and content to truly stand out.. Halo Infinite is amazing return to roots for the Halo games, the gameplay is the closest to older Halo titles with its modernized movement makes it a stand out experience for Halo games. The return to classic aesthetics and design is also a very welcome return. Spartan customization is the best it has ever been in any game to date and PvP is extremely fun and competitive. As for the Campaign it’s a stellar experience, good fun boss fights and its well designed encounters with an extremely fun sandbox make it feel very enjoyable and even more so with friends. Most people will complain about the open world part of it but it’s fun to explore with the grapple hook and look at the gorgeous scenery. It’s also good to see Chief be humanized in the story and the buildup for the next game is amazing. 10/10.. Campaign is excellent, polished and provides excellent replay value. Multiplayer has become very polished, with a variety of game modes and great competitive play.. The first proper good Halo game by 343 studios. The best gunplay in the series to date with a great story, multiplayer is fun and well supported.. reallyadverage open world with an adverage story and good gunplay. The Graphics and Ai are also good.. They have ruined the halo saga created by Bungie. a game that was released half finished without much content. Games ass. No point in playing, lacklustre campaign and multiplayer. 343 aren’t it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A very solid game with a solid Single Player and an addictive Multiplayer. It is fast paced, has good weapon variety, and a huge following that will support the game for years on end. The problem is that 343i is still at the helm and they did a lot of crap that they did in Halo 5 that no one really liked. The multiplayer while fun is still spare in content and game modes. I hate how in modern gaming people think it's ok to release games unfinished or half assed and expect us to be ok with waiting forever on some updates that might make the game complete or whole again. Unfortunately while Halo Infinite is a good game it is one of the biggest offenders of this trend.. I played this some on launch and recently came back to it. It is a smooth game, with a lot going for it and it's free which is wild! I enjoyed my time playing custom games, plus original feeling Halo high paced action.. Best 343 halo out there. The new spirit of fire update 10/10. I do want them to bring back entrenched though.. Undoubtedly one of the best halo games. By far 343's best halo game. The online has been worked on hard by the devs and is now the best online game i have ever played. I highly recomend this game. Worst netcode in the franchise. Story ****, but gameplay itself isn't that bad to play. Still can't give it a good score, when every match to play online is a struggle. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The campaign is good but I wished there were more variety to the locations . The combat is pretty fun as well. Probably, the first decent Halo campaign since Reach. The game would be even 9/10 if it were more technically polished.. Campaign is a huge step forward for 343, not halo 2 or 3 tier campaign but way better than 4 and 5 and I hope for a dlc soon. I haven’t played much multi lately but I still hear that the micro tractions are still pretty crazy, but the multi is still overall good fun like from the old halo games, however the flying vehicles are a bit too OP in my opinion and they NEED to remove SBMM, I’m not that great at the game but when I get a good 15-20 kill game I’m all of a sudden playing against pros the next match.. Another disappointment for the Halo Franchise. Even after all the drip fed content it still doesnt live up to its promises. Doesn't feel like Halo at all the progression system (after they finally added it!) isnt rewarding at all. Half of the maps are lazy recreations that play terribly compared to the originals. 343i can not design maps. Halo infinite, forever the horrible 343 wannabe of Halo Reach.. Halo Infinite is undoubtedly a fun game that brings back the nostalgia of the early Halo titles. The gameplay is solid, and it's clear that the developers aimed to recapture the essence of the franchise's roots. The new Cortana design though... is just plain ugly. They took a beloved character and gave her a makeover that's simply unappealing. It's disappointing to see such a drastic departure from the iconic look that fans know and love. They really missed the mark with this one. As for the plot, I can't help but feel disappointed by the direction of the story. Frankly, I wish they had taken a different approach after defeating the Flood, the fact they want to fixed their screw up of making the FORERUNNERs evil along with Cortana says it all, honestly they just should start all over.. The combat is as satisfying as ever, especially with the addition of the grappling hook, but the generic open world ruins the pacing that made earlier Halo games so entertaining, and you still spend too much time being funnelled down dull grey corridors. The multiplayer, whilst not something I’m particularly interested in, offers pretty much what you’d expect from the series.. This game started off really rough but they have really brand it back. Multiplayer is a blast and the campaign was always good. Absolute torture! F**k the one shot enemies! Badest triple a shooter series ever!. Journey 9 | Design 9.5 | Immersion 8 | Enjoyment 9 | Engagement 7 | Style 9 | Time Value 8.5. After 2 years still the best fps in recent years . The gameplay is just amazing. Halo Infinite started rough, but over time it has improved significantly and is now one of my favorite FPS games, movement feels smooth and responsive, I love the graphics, and the gameplay it’s self is amazing.. coming from halo5 this game feels more like halo campain is really good and boss fight feel smooth i feel the mutiplayer is the best part of this game. A game that since day one the campaign was back to form statement. The semi open world although not to elaborate, is the correct direction for this saga. The story, arts style, physics and over all connecting elements provided a breath of freash air. Multiplayer although a rough start we all know the fantastic state is in.. the controls are fine altho they lack a little stiff from the others, also the open world is bad for the series. Some of the most fun I've had in a Halo campaign (or a game in general). It's a Halo game with modern but not with the gritty art style 4 and 5 have. So that's pretty damn good if you ask me.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Loved the campaign. Multiplayer also great. Enjoyed the open world and story really enjoyable. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not the best Halo campaign or MP by any means but certainly the best in terms of gameplay.. My first Xbox game, gameplay is quite repeating but there is a deep story in it. Could not get it exactly but I think it is related to not playing other games of the series.. Back to form. Far from the best Halo but the best experience we have had since Reach. Need more variety in Campaign though. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I only played ""Halo 5 Guardians,"" and I liked it. When Halo Infinite was released, I decided to play. Then I finished the game. I have mixed feelings about the game. The multiplayer is OK; the main story is my problem; it's not a bad game, but the campaign open world feels repetitive and vacuum. The gun play is fun, the bosses are good, and the last boss is really hard. But when you go back to doing the side quest, most of the missions are repetitive and easy; above all, when you have the tank, it's like going for a walk. I think the game overall is okay. But in the graphics and design world, Halo 5 is better than Halo Infinite. My final score is 7/10.. Halo going back to its roots like a true legend!. Story fade! AD and colors fade too! Really disappointed by that game. Xbox should brought fresher and bigger work!. Writing a review a few years in to say the state of this game (now season 5) is so much better than when it started. A lot has been changed, tweaked, and altered and I love every minute of it. I can't wait to see where this game goes in the future and how it continues to evolve.. Scenario mode is very enjoyable. The cutscenes and music are very successful. In some campaign missions, interiors have repetitive level **** multiplayer side has the competitive and best gameplay mechanics of this generation.. Campaign is awesome but multiplayer was mediocre at launch. Its great now though, best fps of the generation.. Still not a great game, but certainly an improvement from launch… which isn’t really setting the bar too high.. We rockin' with season 5. Season 5 is great. A wonderful game, with an open world that doesn’t feel stale and a good story.. Gameplay is outstanding, but is a shame it launched in such an unfished state. Luckily 343 have continued to support it and have turned the overall game from mediocre to fantastic. 7 at launch, 9 with season 5.. Better than any fps game ever made on the PlayStation. The game released as a nightmare,Pvp in shambles, no forge mode and terrible leadership.2 years later where is the game now? It is not only a quality game, it has complete done a 180. The Mulitplayer playlisthas been revamped and is non stop action and fun no matter what game mode you are playing, forge and custom games allow for a break in teh action to give new experiences everytime. Plus the actual Campign itself boosters a good story in the ""soft"" reebot that they were shooting for. And with 343 basically new team and leadership, You have to have hope that Halo is offically BACK. This review is of the campaign and not MP. To take one of the greatest liner single player FPS campaign franchises and to change it into a poor imitation of farcry was a very surprising disappointment. Very repetitive environments, boring health bar enemies and the classic halo arsenal hidden behind filler content. Compare that to the original all the way back in 2001; gorgeous varied environments, perfect gameplay and enticing story.. this game is nowhere near as perfect as some of the Halo games before it however i believe that the story of this game can stand on its own and that it holds the formula for the Halo games of the future. when playing online you do seem to spend a while finding a match but when you do you know the round will be fun. at the time of writing season 5 has just been released and is bringing many people back to the game.. the combat is just like the old game it is amazing don't really to much bad with it i get it was a bit buggy but other then that it's great andin season 5 of the game it's better then it ever was. Halo Infinite is an underwhelming disappointment in both campaign and multiplayer, comparing to other shooter games halo infinite has a dull and unrealistic gunplay and the animations are horrible. the campaign is very tedious because the open world makes it sometimes extremely difficult to reach your objectives as mountains often stop you and I was stuck not knowing where to go. the plot of the game isn't interesting either. the multiplayer becomes boring even faster than the campaign. overall making halo openworld was a huge mistake which ruined the player experience.. Great in so many ways. Let down by poor atmosphere/music. poorly implemented story elements and a lack of diversity. I thought this Halo would re-capture the mystery and comradery of Halo CE. It seems maybe they were heading in the right direction and ran out of time. More biomes, more enemy types more special events, a better story, some work on atmosphere/music and set pieces would make this game perfect for me. Instead its just good.. Very good campaign and multi-player has come back around. They've improved the multi-player 10 fold. Definitely recommend coming back to give it a try!. A wonderful experience.. Definitely the best Halo game from 343. The graphics are actually very nice. Especially with the ability to play at 120fps. The grapple is a game changer and probably the biggest addition from a gameplay perspective the series has had thus far. The story is one of the best in the series. Much better story than Halo 5 by far. This game felt like Halo 1 and Halo 3 had a baby Only thing is they should of released splitscreen co-op for Series X consoles. Series s is the reason we don’t have it because if parity. The open world didn’t add much and was really the thing I disliked most. But I wont hold it against them for trying something new. We can’t complain about milking and lack of innovation and not let the devs try new things. Now the multiplayer is great heading into season 5. I must say this is then finest Halo since Halo 3.. ITS THE BEST 343 HALO BY FAR, with that said neither the story, multiplayer, level design, music, or polish is the same asbefr, its structure as an open worldits nothing new but the mechanics and freedom makes it feel likechildhood, and the grapplehook is fun. Best Halo since 3. Adds several things to make it feel modernized but the game is through and through Halo combat and outside GAMEPLAY shouldn't have bearing on the game review. ABSOLUTELY MUST PLAY FOR ALL FPS/HALO FANS. If it was on PlayStation it would be unbearable to hear the nonstop praise. But it's not a walking sim with 5 hours of cutscenes..... Had promise but Halo is a big name to live up to, and Infinite sadly missed the mark. Halo infinite feels like any other halo game and that is good since the master chief adventures are supposed to feel like the problem is getting bigger and bigger and there is always a bigger enemy. The controls and mechanics are quite good, this makes the game feels like a contemporary game. The villain(s) are good, you feel that they'll have their own background story and, of course, their own reasons. The game is quite good and interesting, also the multiplayer experience is quite good and fun!. The multiplayer seems to have finally found its footing nearly 2 years after release. Forge map integration into playlists and the now plethora of game modes has Halo Infinite feeling like Halo again (at least for multiplayer). The new leveling system is a vast improvement from launch and no longer forces to you play specific game types to complete daily challenges. Unfortunately, the upheaval at 343 seems to have taken any glimmer of single player DLC with it, which is a bummer. If you haven't played the campaign, it's worth it, but it will leave you wanting more in terms of the potential vs. the outcome. The landscape and enemy bases are recycled throughout the entire map, there's one bland biome, and the ""open world"" is mostly disappointing in terms of discovery (eg Breath of the Wild). At this point, campaign DLC is the only thing in my book that could completely redeem this game from the disaster it was at launch, but something tells it ain't happening.. While Halo Infinite's campaign structure is new territory for the series, and will likely divide opinion, it tells a good story, and creates moments that rank it in the top half when it comes to good Halo campaigns. Throw in a phenomenal multiplayer arena and some stellar shooter mechanics, and it's safe to say that 343 has finally put its stamp on the wonderful world of Halo. TGG – 9 / 10 AUDIO 9/10 Halo Infinite is a blend of old and new when it comes to its score. The old Marty O'Donnell classic riffs are complemented by some new riffs that are clearly heavily influenced by the beats of old, especially Halo 2. It's a very good arrangement, with some solid voice acting to boot. VISUALS 9/10 Halo Infinite's visuals aren't going to blow you away, that's for sure, but from a purely artistic standpoint, it's a very pretty game. Is it next-gen enough? Probably not, but it’s not a sight for sore eyes. Far from it. PLAYABILITY 9/10 It's brilliant. There's no other word for it. From a gameplay point of view, Halo Infinite is not only at the top of its game, but one of the best first-person shooters around, from a handling perspective. DELIVERY 9/10 The open-world campaign is likely to prove divisive, but even beneath the open-world exterior, there's still plenty of narrative-driven and linear sections. Switching structured set pieces for emergent gameplay is certainly a risk, though.. The year-long drought of content in multiplayer is now over, and the floodgates have opened. Multiplayer for this title. There's new content every 2 weeks or so. All the major technical issues have been ironed out. The gameplay is excellent.. It's a good game,Above allAbove all The bell, and I have faith He He Multiplayer FurtherFurther Modes Of game.. Most enjoyable Halo front to back in my opinion.. My favorite Halo game since Reach. The combat and graphics are so freaking good. Feels great to play and the multiplayer has gotten way more content since launch. If you haven’t played it for a while I recommend you jump back in and give it another go. One of the best Halo games ever. The fact the multiplayer is free is icing on the cake.. I don’t play Halo for the multiplayer but I genuinely enjoyed the campaign, loved it but it’s not perfect.. Fantastic fun especially multiplayer! They’ve added a lot more continue to do so. If you like FPS competitive games this would be a no brainer to play. The only good shooter to release in 2021. Gameplay is SOLID. The Best 343 Halo Game To Date : +/- Good Story If A Little Weak in The Middle + Amazing Gameplay + Fun Sandbox Open World - Mid Soundtrack - Weak Characters and Main Villain. An okay game, but as far as halo goes its mediocre at best, took a point off for its free 2 play micro transaction aspects of the multi-player and dull single player story. I suggest getting the Halo Master Chief collection instead.. WTF IS THIS SHYTE???. boring and repetitive game. The animations look old and recycled. This brand is slowly dying. This Game just dont work good. I liked it a lot had a lot of fun playing. Campaign is amazing best since halo reach but multiplayer **** at launch but now it’s the best in the halo franchise. The worst Halo. Absolutely the worst. Did not appeal to me in any way. Boring, no depth, horrible story and ok gameplay. Such a shame.. This game is a return to form for Halo, and it's incredibly fun. The campaign and multiplayer are fantastic, well-crafted experiences.. Good campaign mode but I'm stuck because the differculty is insane difficulty and I'm not keen To restart all the way back again. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD That trash game, the gaming industry will lose nothing if such a poor franchise as halo does not exist. Don't let the reviews complaining early lack of multiplayer content stop you from enjoying this game. Halo Infinite is a very enjoyable game and both the multiplayer and campaign have a lot to offer. It has only gotten better over time.. The game has some problems, but its extremely fun gameplay and amazing gameplay cancels them out, it's one of the most addictive games I've played. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The console war has generated intense debate when it comes to exclusives. Halo Infinite has been no exception; from the day that the advances of the game were shown, only the bad began to be seen, to such an extent that it is cataloged ","the world of Zeta Halo is beautifully detailed, with expansive environments, rich textures, and impressive lighting that evoke the grandeur of the franchise’s early days . the move to an open-world format recaptures the sense of wonder and freedom found in the original Halo while offering new opportunities for exploration, strategic planning, and discovery . the game stands as a must-play for fans and a shining example of how to honor a legacy ."
828.PixelJunk Shooter,"PixelJunk Shooter is certainly the one PixelJunk game you want to play if you only play one of them. With an easy difficulty and a lot of fun and inventive puzzles this game will make anyone have a good time, especially bouncing to the music.. PixelJunk Shooter is the first PixelJunk game I've ever really played. I've played the demos of Eden, Monsters, and Shooter all previously, and I've even bought all of them since then (plus Racers 2nd Lap and Eden on PC), but with backlogs what they are these days Shooter is the first one I've actually gotten around to playing. I say that to really say while I'm interested in the PixelJunk series, I didn't go into this as a pre-existing fan. The strongest points of Shooter are its clean, almost vector-like graphics, its bass-heavy soundtrack, and its unique fluid mechanics. Any one of these aspects could warrant a purchase to the right person, but the three in unison produce quite the artistic tour de force. Practically in trade-off for this however is a short gameplay length (Braid, Limbo), a fairly easy difficulty (Fez), and when you get down to it, generally unimaginative gameplay mechanics (Fez, again). Is it fun? Yeeesss... for a time. But few surprises are thrown your way and it's over right when it's gotten warmed up. The core gameplay is, if you look past the unique fluid mechanics, fairly simple. Fly around, collect survivors, kill a few token baddies. It's hardly taxing and fairly evident where the majority of planning and development went to. Two players can help to liven things up a bit, but is generally quite unnecessary. At a little over 4 hours in length its perfectly reasonable for a game of its type, though not a strong point. I'll mention that there's a ""collect all the hidden gems mechanic"" to extend the gameplay by a little bit, but not being much of a completionist, it really did nothing for me and honestly seemed rather tedious. But all in all Shooter is one of those games where the art, the sound, and the mechanics come together well for an experience greater than the sum of its parts.. This game is really fun. Sort of like the ""Kirby"" games, it is easy - if you want to beat it, you surely will. I found it was very short too - cleared it in under a couple days. So why the high score? The core mechanics feel really good to interact with. The visuals are crisp, distinct and lively. The music by High Frequency Bandwidth is awesome. Also, even after you blast through it, there's the challenge of finding all the hidden diamonds and climbing the leaderboards. It's a good balance - most people can see the whole game, but those who want more challenge can push themselves to do better. The sequel pretty much threw that out the window and went for the hardest thing they could possibly make, so beware of that - but here I'm reviewing the first game, and it's a must have for PSN shooter, or PixelJunk/Q Games fans.. Highly overrated game. They have some nice ideas with the manipulation of elements, but the execution is mediocre at **** so called ""puzzles"" are extremely rudimentary and easy. No challege. The solution to each ""scene"" is so obvious it's not even enjoyable. Just mindlessly blasting through areas to get to the **** that good. If I don't even need to think to get through your game, you did not try hard enough.. What can I say about Pixel Junk Shooter? First and foremost it!s a game that I've been dreaming for years! It's a game that has been made by game enthusiasts to game enthusiasts. I enjoyed every minutes, every seconds of this game. It made me feel the excite mend that I was feeling when I first played legendary game Another World years ago. Pure fun. Pure addictive. Plus state of art genius levels and bosses designs. You can't get one which is better than this! Simple mechanics yet, truly, truly a beautiful game.","with an easy difficulty and a lot of fun and inventive puzzles this game will make anyone have a good time . the strongest points of Shooter are its clean, almost vector-like graphics and its bass-heavy soundtrack . at a little over 4 hours in length its perfectly reasonable for a game of its type, though not a strong point ."
"829.Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade","As someone who plays old games for their story modes, a game made for multi player in mind is not so enjoyable to me, so i disliked this game even tho its great.. I didn't have much fun with the main game in this series either, but the linearly chaptered gameplay, for all its unbalance, at least gives you a purpose, even if it's a bad one, to keep going and you can finish it. But In Dark Crusade, it's just a matter of capturing every point on the map to win, and it's not a fun or narrative campaign. It's just a few pages of text and very short, generic cutscenes. It was made for online gameplay in time for those who like the races in 40K. If your goal is the story, there's no reason to continue after a few hours of single player play and not only is there no story, but the gameplay is unbalanced and difficult because of the terrible AI. Compared to the main game of the series and the previous DLC, there have always been suggestions from some players to play Dark Crusade first, but despite all the problems of the other games, at least they have a campaign. This one continues to have problems and limitations with unit controls and doesn't offer a campaign. With such a problematic gameplay, I don't understand why this 40K game is included in the lists of the best RTS games of all time. Those who make such lists probably either don't really play the games or are nostalgia-obsessed fans.. It's the best WH40K RTS, forever in my heart. The only true Dawn of War for me.. This was my first Warhammer game. I like it. The animations are very good and detailed even tho it is a strategy game. You zoom in and see how good they are. Soundtrack adds to the atmosphere of the game. The campaign has some interesting mechanics.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. XXL version of the original game .. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A very solid sequel the the first Dawn of War. While there's no campaign, there is a map-conquest mode where you choose a race and fight other races for control. You can upgrade your hero and it's actually not bad and still holds up in 2022.. In terms of gameplay - the best DoW game out there, and I've played all of the original series. The armies are more distinct, assymetric, yet - better balanced, than in Soulstorm which came out later. For example - DoW: DC doesn't have flying units across the board, but some factions, most notably the Eldar - have units which can ""hop"" some distance through the air. This really gives them an advantage and makes then the most mobile race, prioritizing stealth and speed over everything else. In SoulStorm - each race (except Necrons, I think) - gets an air unit, which is poorly implemented both visually (it gets repaied by ground units while in the air), and tactically (Soulstorm doesn't _really_ support air-air or air-ground combat, the air units are just awkward there) Also, the campaign - each race's HQ area has a unique gameplay to beat. With Necrons - you gotta plant a bomb with your main commander and escape in time. With Eldar - you fight them as well as Orks as well as Chaos which the Eldars control, until you finally find and destroy their main base. With Chaos - you gotta destroy the Warp Gate. OTOH, in Soulstorm - EVERY HQ battle is about destroying their main building. Simple as that. Except against Dark Eldar, where you gotta destroy their mobile superunit. DoW: DC also has many non-HQ areas which give certain perks which are hugely valuable. The earlier DoW games have more linear campaign, and less playable races. They aren't bad but offer less in terms of gameplay. The DoW-2 games shift from RTS to something ARPG-style, no more base building. So can't really compare. DoW:DC probably has the highest replayability factor among the DoW series as playing each race is offers a hugely different, and in 1 playthrough you'll probably only ever step foot on half of the maps, and beat half of the 6 opponents. The AI in DoW:DC seems to be some of the best AI I've seen in RTS. It's not dumb nor particularly predictable except for very edge-case situations. And unlike many games where the AI kinda sits there and waits for you to come to them - the 6 AI factions actively fight each other, too! It's not a one-way progression, it's totally possible to beat 3 out of 6 enemies but lose the campaign because one of the remaining 3 has beaten the other 2, but became stronger than you are. The AI can and will attack your hard-earned territories. You might lose some of them during the course of the game. It will even force you to pull back and defend your HQ instead of pushing forward - in huge contrast to many RTS where the player's expansion is a one-directional path to domination. Overall, for the non-linear gameplay, dynamic in-map and global progression (where the AI can take initiative and come knocking on YOUR HQ's door when you're happily having victory after victory on the other side of the planet, or even within map), the uniquely non-symmetric but still very balanced factions, 7 of them - makes me give this game an overall 10/10 score - which I haven't given to many games at all. There's mods for DC to add more units from the lore. I've played those a bit but they aren't nearly as polished, nor balanced, as the vanilla game with the just right variety of units to be fun but not overwhelming.. I enjoyed this game as much as the previous 2. Although at first I missed the lack of story, I then got to play the game with just the races I wanted to - Orcs and Necrons. Both play enjoyably differently and it's unusual for me to enjoy a game enough to effectively play through it twice. There is a little bit of grind going on, but it's enjoyable all the same.. Spent countless hours playing this game with my brother. Best game, and still is, very much playable even today.. i still love the game to death! over 1000 hours played wish there was more game like this. My favourite expansion for the original Dawn of War. It adds several new races and mechanics and has a brand new campaign based on the conquering of the planets part by part. The last thing as actually a downgrade compared to the original and Winter Assault expansion as it's not a well-written story but just a series of levels poorly connected to each other. What it lacks in storytelling is totally compensated by the great gameplay with diverse factions and applicable tactics.. The most epic game ever made and BEST game in Warhammer 40000 series Must play!. Early born child lack limbs and arms. Death to the corpse emperor Plain vanilla story writing, any fan could easily predict the story about 3 missions into the campaign Multiplayer AI resource cheat is real and stupid No retreat, units are weak as ants Micro intensive and lack auto-cast for units. This and soulstorm are still to this day the best Warhammer games that have been made. The main difference between the 2 are that in the DC campaign mode all your buildings stay built when you defend. Grab a good mod like Titanium and this game will destroy DOW II and DOW III. With titanium you have just about every unit that is in the codex. I think IG has about 25+ different tanks, and that is just their tanks. Each faction has more units available than all 3 of the pathetic factions combined from DOW III. Save your money and don't buy DOW III, just download the mods for this and enjoy.. Best dlc for a down of war game ever it brought a new awesome faction great extra missions and improved the game even more if you don't like this dlc there's something wrong with you. Such a fun game. Never been a fan of thes etypes of games (i normally play MMO's and FPS games) but being a slight warhammer fan and finding almost no faults with this game i ahve to give it 10/10. My only critisicm would be that i was sad to find no expansion to this game, outside of its none official Titanium wars add on which i thoroughly reccomend.. This game absorbed me for almost 100 hours. I loved the new addition of the Risk style campaign map, though I found the Necrons basically swept across the map killing everyone and losing zero battles. But that is the only complaint I have. The Necrons are very over-powered, but it was pretty awesome to watch my guardsmen wipe their stupid base once and for all, and their strength really felt true to the lore and canon of Warhammer 40,000. The skirmish mode is great, I found that the AI is pretty challenging and always kept me on the defensive on hard. I did not get a chance to play multiplayer. The Army Painter is also great, making a return from DoW and Winter Assault. Making endless different Imperial Guard regiments was very fun. Overall, this game deserves a ten. It has balancing issues, yes, but if you're looking for an authentic Warhammer 40k experience, with space marines mowing down orks and guardsmen desperately holding their base, this is where to go.. For the Emperor! Dark Crusade (DC from now on) is a RTS game set in the Warhammer 40K universe, and that much you knew. What you probably didn't knew is that this game is awesome! The sheer number of different units makes the game varied and interesting, with dozens upon dozens of models. The units emanate charisma from every angle, faithful to the boardgame ones. The story is interesting enough, and the main campaign can hook you up for days. The balancing is superb, with no unit feeling overpowered or useless. It has not a resource gathering mechanic -well, it does, but revolves around the capturing and holding of key points rather than trees, iron and the like. A smart move, since the combat for key points is the heart of the boardgame. Visually it's okay, but it has aged - and it shows. The gripes I have with the graphics are about some special effects, with a few ingenuities regarding monitor resolution, resolved by mods. Because it's open to mods! Overall a great game, and a must for every RTS appassionate.. It's a standalone DLC for the real game that surpasses its base in every way, though you should still buy the original and maybe Winter Assault for the extra multiplayer races. An RTS made by Relic, it deviates from other games in the genre by having units grouped into squads beforehand. As much as I hate Warhammer, this game was just excellent in general, especially with the territorial conquest in single player. I'd recommend getting the game on Steam so that you can still play online MP (moved from GameSpy to Steamworks) or just buy the Amazon DRM-Free copy and check the game's forums. There's a pinned article from SEGA with a link to a website where they accept box codes and give Steam keys out to retail owners.. Really the best Warhammer 40k strategy game. I just like the necrons and the gameplay (espacially the multiplayer). If you like Strategy games this is a must have .... this is not just one of the best rts games ever made it is also one of the best all time games ever made. this is a must buy for warhammer 40k fans and rts fans. what can i say about this game? it happened to be the first game i played on pc and it is really hard to describe it... it.... MAN THIS GAME WAS F*CKING AWESOME!. Probably the best DOW ever, rivaled by only the original. Excellent replayability, interesting races, and a good overall campaign and story. Last good one before adding insanely detached races like sisters of whatthatwas and ruining the experience with DOW2. Not a 10, however, because it has some downsides: Cutscenes are lazy. Every time something interrups the speaker, you can hear the person finish the sentence and exhale, waiting for a second bfore he is ""interrupted"". Animations are poor in cutscenes, and they dulled the razor sharp units. Shackled creation of elite units, dulled damage. The low damage makes sharp painful combat be a long, dull, drawn out engagement, much like WC3. Also not a 10 because they are already slacking on the factions. Necrons are beautiful, but Tau is lazy, with many units being very similar in appearance. Too long range, overpowered when in AI hands that micromanages. But, with a nice, replayable, boss-fight campain it is one heck ****. Too bad they didn't polish it a bit more. Better voice acting and cutscenes would have made this and incredible game. Also, they nerfed the Dreadnought. Pity.. Benjamin S: Your review, I think, was logical up till the point that you reiterated that nine races was obscene and that the themes taken by the writers for some races were questionable. This made me realize you probably have never rolled a dice nor played the tabletop game of this wonderful game. There are in fact more races than nine in the tabletop form of the game, and the ""balance"" is made by making each individual really good at something, but lacking in something else. For example, Eldar had tons of specialist troops that were really good at what they do (Dire Avengers absolutely pouring out shots like it was nothing),but were extremely fragile and somewhat expensive as far as points. If there were a universal ""balance"" of power, then I agree, gameplay would become pretty boring as the races seem to be intertwined. That's why the developers at the former company of THQ added more races with different attributes, which can clearly be seen in the Tau's overall godliness at shooting, the space marines being expensive but good at everything, the Eldar's speed, the Necron's toughness, and the imperial guard and ork's strength in numbers. Your criticism of the themes that the people at THQ had for their races also rings hollow when you dig into some of the tabletop game's lore. Orks are meant to be stupid, they're fungi made into a humanoid form. Necrons and Tau basically worship technology but their lore says why. Necrons made a pact with a god who appears as a metallic figure to immortalize their race as they were facing extinction, but the god turned them into soulless machines to do his bidding to pretty much annihilate anything. The Tau worship technology because they were deprived of it. Think of going to a third world country with an iphone, or even better think of Hernan Cortez being worshipped as a god by the Incas for his appearances, ships, and horses. I'm assuming the death theme has to do with the Chaos faction. That should really be a no brainer, there has to be a villainous character, so why not exemplify it into an entire race who, in the lore, attempted to kill the Imperial Guard's/Space Marine's god? Feminist's? The only feministic race I could think of in Dark Crusade would be Eldar, and yeah that's just because the founders of the table top game just made like that to fit their attributes of sneakiness and deception. So really, all your problems with the dev's as far as themes are honestly unfounded because they took most of the content from the tabletop game. Warhammer 40k deserved a game and got it, to go astray from the game now would just be utter stupidity.. This is, by far, one of the most fun RTS games on the PC. The gameplay isn't balanced for competitive play, and the graphics are getting dated, but the great 40k lore and loads of interesting units more than make up for its shortcomings. If you can find a used copy somewhere, or it happens to be on sale on steam, grab this game ASAP.. Dark Crusade is a rare triumph in PC strategy gaming. The 7 races are rich both in character and in fighting style, each with a substantial variety of different infantry and vehicular units, as well as an epic pantheon of heroes. The story mode is interesting and varied, and can be played through multiple times with different races and outcomes. Probably the most impressive element of this epic game, however, is the shockingly versatile camera, allowing for stunning cinematic battle scenes completely in real-time. The only downsides (and there are few) are the terrible difficulty customization, which changes enemy unit strength instead of their strategy, and the limited multiplayer options for those who don't own the core game. Overall, though, these really don't even put a dent in the overall experience. Buy this game and bring the grim darkness of the far future straight to your PC!. This game ruined what could have been the best RTS game series ever, and is the single most driving reason why I have never bought another THQ/Relic game at full price when it was first released since that time. Having played the original DOW and Winter Assault, I was a die hard DOW fan and supporter; but the play and deviation from the original first person story line of the first two took so much joy out of the game that I never bothered to finish it.. After playing DoW: Retribution and loving it a friend told me this game was also pretty good, and quite frankly, this game exceeds Retribution, True, last stand is a great and fun game mode, but this game is so much more. While retribution's campaign is lackluster and feels like all you do is build a deathstar, this game rewards ingenuity, and each match feels like multiplayer. Another great addition to campaign is AI's that fight back, something that was so lacking in retribution I was only able to complete a paltry 3 campaigns. In review: great game, good replay value, still has O.K. graphics despite being 6 years old. This Expansion is really perfect. Adds 2 races, interesting changes in gameplay, massive campaign with good replay value and new units for old races. This addon is definitely worth a try for every RTS fan. For fans of DoW a must buy.. An excellent expansion, and a great standalone game in its own right. Dark Crusade provides a tremendous amount of content at a stellar price. The game gives one the choice of any of seven distinctive, well-balanced factions for use in a campaign on a Risk-style map. No two factions play alike; this, coupled with the fact that each faction's individual campaign is tailored to its back story, makes successive playthroughs of the game feel like new experiences rather than stale repetitions. This gives the game immense replayability. Needless to say, the gameplay is a lot of fun as well, and the campaigns are structured such that the battles fought therein do not feel repetitive. Fans of Warhammer 40K will love this game. I suggest to anyone that they buy Platinum Edition (the original Dawn of War plus Winter Assault and Dark Crusade) so as to get the entire experience, but if you must choose only one of the series, Dark Crusade is your best bet. 10/10. I seldom give perfect scores, but Dark Crusade deserves one. It's campaign replayability value is incredible (the dialogues between army commanders shine) and there are good times to be had playing this game online with mates. A standalone expansion with 7 playable, pretty balanced races and it should be cheap as dirt right now. If you don't own it, just get it. I'm serious. All-around, it's the best DoW to date.. Excellent strategy game for those who are bored with StarCraft. This is the best Dawn of War game in my opinion and exceeds Soulstorm and the Dawn of War II series. The gameplay is unique and refreshing to say the least and the graphics are pretty damn good for a 2006 title I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the 40k universe or RTS in general.. When I got Dawn of War, I was instantly hooked. I then Proceeded to get Winter Assault. Even better! But failing to find Dark Crusade, I turned to Soul Storm, which is the let down of the series. A year later I get Dark Crusade. From the second I picked it up, I noticed something. This was much better than Soul Storm, an alleged improvement. Nowadays, with Dawn of War already up to the second expansion of Dawn of War 2, I STILL prefer Dark Crusade. It has a terrible balance, however, because most races are better at fighting than others, and some are just weak until WAY down the research chain (I'm looking at you IG, with your strong as paper infantry, and crazy strong tanks). Still, Dark crusade forced you to sometimes lose a province to destroy a stronghold, which has always made me double-check every move I made. In my opinion, this could never be as tedious as Retribution (It's the same map and enemies 7 times, woo hoo?).. Top of the line as far as strategy games go. It works like risk where you attack once a turn, but instead of rolling dice you battle rts style. The game focuses on proper squad management over infrastructure, and you really get rewarded for great tactics instead of memorizing hotkeys. You can spend points on various upgrades like elite units or boosts similar to what you'd find in risk, and while the campaign doesn't really have much story since the other factions can win or lose at any time, its certainly a fresh look at the genre.. This game IMHO ruined the single player story line of the Dawn of War series, as it introduced multi-race Campaign, so the story entirely depends on what race you chose, whereas the original had a very good story line that was only made for one race therefore the story was better. But I will admit that this game did increase the replay value and made multiplayer allot better.","the linearly chaptered gameplay is not a fun or narrative campaign . it's just a few pages of text and very short, generic cutscenes . the gameplay is unbalanced and difficult because of the terrible AI ."
83.God of War (2005),"Incredibly ambitious for its time. Good story & with a good combat system. The platforming was clunky but it grew on me.. the games has aged really well. its production values are really high if not only for the time it came out. the tight overall gameplay that has been a blast even though I can't always get the hang of it. but its not like its not worth taking the time to learn how it works. and if anything, if not for the narrative seeds that were planted in the original trilogy. God of War 2018 wouldn't have worked at all. The original Trilogy is the reason why God of war 2018 works. and I love it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the game that gave me my love for the hack and slash genre. Truely a great power fantasy that really does a great job with showing you how powerful Kratos is. Also those mini games for the red orbs are always a good laugh (you all know the ones I’m talking about). Game that got me into the GOW series, brutal and amazing game for any action lover.... I have so much love for this game. This review will be full of bias. Just a heads up. When I was a kid, I loved games. Granted, my exposure to them was basically Fairly Odd Parents licensed games and Tony Hawk’s Underground. For YEARS, my dad would not let me near his game collection. Time passed, I left early childhood behind me and entered my middle school years. My dad sat me down, handed me the controller, and we played God of War every time i was at his house til we beat it. The game was, and still is, incredible. A quick 5-10 hour romp through ancient Greece, distributing ultraviolence to everyone we came into contact with. This led me down the hack n’ slash rabbit hole for years to come. When God of War 2018 came out, he sat next to me again and we played through it. I will never get another happy sob like i did when I laid down that night to realize it had come full circle. Thank you, Sony, for the memories.. The best way to start a franchise, impactful and coherent lore, strong and interesting characters, nice usage of Greek mythology, good graphics for the time. Excellent game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It just perfect. The game feels so good even if it's from the PS2. Especially when you play by cloud on the PS5 with a good Wifi I recommend this game on PS Plus Premium at 100%.. Everything about this game is great. I really love the combat, you can feel the slicing of your weapons and the system feels so intuitive. The only thing to blame is the boss fight.. It was ahead of its time and it was one of the best games thatIt went down and can be played now and enjoyAlthough it is She'll be 20 years old.. Loved this game and got me stuck to the franchise and I still love all the God of war games!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best God of War, in my opinion; the story, gameplay, and powers were the best. The new God of Wars are flashier but don't have as much personality or originality as this game did.. One of my favorite games ever it's a fun hack and slash game with a amazing story and one of my favorite protagonists. i dont understand how this is regarded as one of the best games ever. its tedious and boring and has plenty of issues.. A masterpiece, literally, my favorite video game saga, the final battle is great, Santa Monica Studio has the rifo, Kratos is my favorite protagonist, even though it is a game from 2005, it is still a great game recommended. Amazing plot, good graphics for a 2005 game, great combat mechanics and the most iconic character of ps2 history. (it may have some mistakes because its a bit old but it doesnt matter because everything else is perfect).. Is a Greatest Game, All Level Resources And Objects Sound Graphics, Everthing it's Very And Hard Placed... For 2005 God of Works] [ History Still pretty Nice.. Horrible janky garbage with way too many enemies that spawn almost indefinitely. Horrible, one of the worst games ive ever played. I love well-crafted video games! The stories are fantastic! Plus, you have to be smart to solve the puzzles they throw at you. But, just like hanging on the phone 24/7, you shouldn't play 24/7. If you like Greek Mythology, GOD OF WAR would astound you Can't wait for the movie!. The story is legendary and the gameplay is great but the game was too short and i love when it was hard. The beginning of the strongest PlayStation franchise to date, God of War on the PS2 is a remarkable achievement, delivering great visuals and cinematic yet engaging gameplay for its time. Kratos, who also happens to be the best PlayStation protagonist, handles quite well throughout tight combat encounters and movement-based obstacles. Enemy variety is strong and the gameplay loop of obtaining new weapons and spells to upgrade and use against foes is very rewarding. Some quick-time-event aspects of the combat can be finicky, but overall it works well. The narrative has become a classic tale in gaming, with great animations and performances from voice actors. The camera works very well to show off sweeping vistas and far-off titans or temples. Overall an incredibly fun and solid title, aside from some janky sections and balance issues.. Yeah, God of War is a EXTREMELY fun game, i liked a lot, but its a bit frustrating in some way, some parts with big bunch of enemies attacking you all the time, some bad plataforming in the game's final levels, but i have a relief about this game, its the first of the franchise, the next ones obviously are more fun and less frustrating. this is a cool ahh game fn where tht bald ahh ni kratos be like t earing em up yk and he got alil boooty at the start yk wat imean but nahghhhhfghghu dh better than that st5upid ahh shid they be realasing now like fr play this **** fnfnfnfnfnff. ""God of War"" is a PS2 masterpiece. Featuring an iconic character inspired by Greek myths, the game is a glorious M-rated adventure. Released in 2005, GOW still holds up well in 2024. It's arguably the best action-adventure game on the console. I would rate it with a 10 out of 10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. one of the best hack and slash of ps2 juegaso 10 de 10 good story and gameplay. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good and fun to play game. Very good bosses and the felling of achieving something after completing the game. However i think the difficulty (specially last boss) was a little bit too high 8/10. Still one of the most amazing games and must play for every gow fan and gamer in general. I'm not sure if this a natural progression from Goro on hand held and Amstrad but I loved the ending to this game where you went to hell. I had to hug my fam in intervals while fighting the last boss. After the clock there was a video explaining the production.. One of the greatest Games of All Time, the Gory Game play and legendary soundtrack and great adult story, the atmosphere of the game is soo Great. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The storyline was great, the action felt a little repetitive and the sexualizing of women in this was a bit much. But overall a fun time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. If anything, the spectacles are certainly fun to watch.. man was it so hard but it was good. This is God of War! Not that lame 2018 version.. This game is very good Puzzles make me relax and use my brain more Good fighting game. God of War on the PlayStation 2 is the pinnacle of action-adventure gaming. It skillfully combines elements from other successful titles, delivering a mature and visually impressive experience.. One of my best ps2 game I have alot memory's with it. That's my GoW.. I will never understand why people love this game so much to this day. It's fine... short and sweet. And thats all.. The best action-adventure game on the PlayStation 2. Inspired by the ancient Greek myths, it blends the combat systems of ""Onimusha"" and ""Devil May Cry"" with the puzzles and platforming of ""Prince of Persia"". Featuring gory violence and naughty content, the game certainly earns its 'M' rating. Game creator David Jaffe was inspired by the feature film ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""Heavy Metal"" magazine and it shows. The game combines the cinematic presentation of the former with the adult content of the latter. God of War is also one of the best looking titles in the PS2 library. The CGI rendered cutscenes are amazing, the animation is smooth and there is no framerate or screen tearing issues. At the time of its release, the game's graphics were noted as being close to Xbox quality. Of course, good gameplay is what really counts and GOW delivers it in spades. This is a 10-12 hour action-adventure game with no padding at all. It's compelling and entertaining from beginning to end. I would give it a 9.5 out of 10.. Classic, one of my favourite PS2 games, very good story, has great gameplay, is indeed one of the most memorable games of the generation.. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. Genre-spanning platform/adventure/beat 'em up with combat that's a little too reliant upon button bashing and a difficulty level that's brutal on the higher settings, but it looks and sounds great and has a cool storyline based upon ancient Greek mythology.. Played on the aeathersx2 emulator on the android. Similar to other games from the serie. Nice plot. The original God of War on PS2. Good times. This is a must-have game for a lot of PS2 owners. Epic. This game serves as a great reminder about how games were, and should still be made. The game's pacing is exhilarating, as the game whisks you through one beautiful locale after another, with few to no stagnant moments throughout. The combat is simple to understand, but hard to master, as the combos continue to get more nuanced and situationally effective as the enemies get tougher, forcing the player to adapt from button-mashing to strategic combo moves to succeed. God of War's story is one of brutal violence and not much emotional tension, but it still captivated me through Kratos' own journey of self-understanding and reconciliation with who he really is. This game will forever stand as a pillar of excellence among video games.. Great game, the combat is really enjoyable despite being so simple. Sometimes it can be a little frustrating and unfair, but it still holds really well. However, just at the end of the game they just make everything fall off with some actually unfair battles, ignoring all the staff they have been building up during the rest of the game and making it seem actually unfair for no reason.. Second best Playstation 2 Game ever after God of war 2. great combat good difficuility good boss fight and one of the hardest like Ares great Story. God Of War is a great slasher. fantastic story , gameplay , boss fights , game design and music.. Playing the first God of War in 2023 was a frustrating experience. While the story and cutscenes are great and hold up very well, the game feels unfair. Now I might have forgotten that older games were way harder but some sequences were overtuned with enemies that took too long to kill and constantly respawned. The blocking system did not feel natural and you became stunned easily which took momentum out of fights. I loved the level design and the mix with puzzles on the other hand, the camera work was stellar showing you impressive vistas in the background that made the levels feel bigger than they are. There are hidden secrets and chests to find and the environments are varied enough. Overall the game did not age very well and would have received a better rating from me on release.. A fun classic PS2 action game. The set pieces here are pretty fun and the theme and presentation really elevate it. Unfortunately the combat is rather basic, but still enjoyable. It leans heavily on the sheer satisfaction of ripping enemies apart with your basic combos.. It´s not a masterpiece but it is a game. Could be way better, as the sequels would show, but it is fun.. I have never seen such a game before. In one word: legend. The pleasure of playing is very high, the story of the game is very beautiful. In my opinion, it is the best game in the God of War series.. God Of War (2005) still holds up very well with its graphics and gameplay. The level design, characters, and story are all perfect. I recommend it even today. A flawless masterpiece.. Great game with cool combat system even to this date highly recommend playing this one if u like the newer godd of war games :). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good game didn't like some aspects but overall, it is worth playing. Has an ok story with a cool setting.. Hello, this is a default review because i'm forced to use 75 characters. I'll edit this review in the future talking about the game, don't worry ;) My final rate is: 9. this is the start of the series that made what playstation is today the main franchise series of PlayStation with the biggest most icon character when you think about PlayStation you think about what started it all and thats Kratos and boy does this game hit hard right from the beggining with an epic hydra boss fight the graphics are amazing the screen space reflections in the game are so good the music backstory storytelling voice acting motion capture cinematics everything is top notch i loved all the magic this is the only god of war where you can throw zeus's lightning bolt the city of athens was beautiful and let me talk to you about this game's briliant game design the game design is punishing frustrating as hell but briliant there isn't another god of war game with so many innovative puzzles traps obstacles and platforming legdes to fall to your death trying to speedrun the game on easy mode under 5 hours while using the infinite magic glitch is still so hard and challenging because of those puzzles traps and platforming ledges so i really appreciate the challenge even though the camera and camera angles are so bad that during these challenges i wanna pull my hair and i feel like the minotour boss fight and protecting kratos family shouldn't be harder than the final boss ares but they are so the game design aint perfect it has its flaws but man from city of athens to the desert to climbing cronos to entering the pandora labyrinth on cronos back and doing poseidon hades challenges the level design art deisng is just briliant i wish there was more boss fights something god of war 3 did very well but no game is completely perfect. david jaffe corry barlog and the developers team set the bar and ignited the flame in gaming back in the day by creating this masterpiece that will never be forgotten and must be remaked for the PS5 i want all the god of war games in one collection remade for PS5. Masterpiece! Very dark and brutal game with intense story telling. Gameplay was also amazing.. The original God of War is hardest of the God of War games I have played. Good magics and some nice costumes for bonus play. I give the original God of War a score of 10. this game is Fcking so good i think its the bestest start for a Triple .......... This Exodus into the world of God of War is nothing but pure spectacle, violence, and tough-as-nails combat. At the very start, the brutal setting is realized and continues throughout the game with varied enemies and abilities. The pacing can get bogged down by puzzles and frustrating enemy encounters, and the level design, while great at times, can also be annoying and cumbersome. The story is rather basic as well, offering not a whole lot of thought, but in the face of what the game is trying to convey, this is no more than a trite inconvenience. The game is chock full of secrets to find, and shows that the developers put much thought into how to design the levels and the world for that matter. God of War is an instant classic, despite its short comings and poor aging and is still definitely worth a play through.. great great great What can I say about this masterpiece? All versions of God's War are masterpieces and deserve praise. A very good game, but very unfair punishes at times, and puts it in one place with better sequels is unfair too. It's pretty good, but has minor flaws. It's age surely shows that its curdling like expired milk. However, the flavor is aged like a fine wine. ""You should play God of War, It'll get you laid"" - Richard Foge. Very interesting game. really, God of War is probably the best games on ps2. Not one mechanic did not have time to get bored, on the contrary, when the game ends, you want more (more will be in God of War 2;)). The plot is interesting and logical, the graphics are very good for the time, the level pumping is interesting, but some powers have no occasion to use, so they seem to be superfluous, although also good, just no normal implementation. Cons: some very annoying moments inherent in many games of those times (mazes are normal here), but 90% of the gameplay takes place without them, and that's good! The fight with the last boss is not interesting at all by the standards of God of war. Must-play!. At this point an all-time classic, the first game of God of War, unlike other pieces from the 2000s, has aged so well, and, except some of the old-camera moves and perspectives, that make the game frustrating at some points, the game feel and the story is exceptionally accomplished, turning the beginning of our favorite god killer into a must play masterpiece.. This game is one of the BEST PS2 games you will ever find. It has been re-released on the PS3 in HD as well. This game has fun combat and a good story. The story is more of a background story but it adds value to the game. This game has a great sound track that hits hard and only makes the action in the game run at a million miles an hour. For extra fun you can bump up the difficulty. You will learn a lot about Greek mythology while playing this game which is a bonus! PLAY THIS GAME! This game is a 10/10 for me, a great PlayStation Classic. Played on PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3.. Gameplay - 10/10 Characters - 8/10 Visuals - 8/10 Story - 8.5/10 Uniqueness - 9/10. Looking back at this game, it's honestly really good. The combat was fluent and didn't do too much, it was simple yet effective. And before some people say ""iTs jUsT bUtToN mAsHiNg"", if it's button mashing for you then you **** at the game lmao. I've played all the DMC games and Metal Gear Rising, both games are pretty critically acclaimed for how solid their combat is, and God of War is not a testosterone-filled button masher. In addition to the combat, the story is quite captivating if you pay attention. The puzzles are challenging, and a bit dated, but the payoff more than makes up for it. All in all, it's a fun, story-driven Hack n' Slash game that holds up really well today.. amazing in every way an icon in the gaming industry that cemented it as one of the best games of all times for me and was the beginning of a franchise that never disappointed me. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Soundtrack of this game is awesome. But when playing in 2022, some in game features hangs on time. Puzzles are ruin the pace. Nevertheless, this game has wonderful and very epic storyline. Also, has a fun gameplay and the beginning of a legend.. Gameplay perspective, Completely challenging and addictive, adrenaline rush throughout the entire game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Definitely the ancestor of Hack and Slash games. A revolutionary work for its year. Excellent storytelling. Very good gameplay dynamics. And of course the legendary music. Thanks to this game, I became interested in Greek mythology :)). I don't know what's wrong with me but I don't like the first God of War game. This game has a lot of good things. The gameplay, character designs, level design etc. This game is little bit long but it is okay. You just boring a few episode. The weapon types are not too many. We have too many spells in this game but you can't use effectively because the magic capacity is not too much.. God of War's lenient mechanics make for a good power fantasy, but not a very tough challenge.. This game is taking firm steps towards becoming the best company of today and in the future, this game is just as perfect as other games.. An amazing game in every right. God of War is one of the greatest games on the PS2.. Great game Very fluid controls, great diversity of scenery, beautiful graphics together with a perfect story!. I love this game I play that's in my childhood Always i enjoy killing people in this game. I find this to be a bad ass game with great combat and memorable boss fights. The upgrades you'll get are a great addition in this hack 'n slash and it's also a great challenge. So why the 7? It's a 7 for me because the menu music eventually literally got under my skin and that nearly ruined the experience for me.. Best god of war ,pretty cool adventure ..nice puzzles ..Soundtrack amazing ... One of my favorites franchises started with this amazing game. The combat is awesome,frenetic and addictive. The story is great and deep, one of the best PS2 games.. It's a start for a good journey. The places where we could hunt down everyone and everything is diverse enough.. The game is great, but compared to the later games, this one lacks polish. The fighting is wacky at times and the cutscenes are horrendous. Yet I still enjoy and love this game.. Yes, this game was very fun and well worth the 14.99 I paid for it on sale. The story has Kratos as a man hell bent on revenge. The target for his revenge, Ares the god of war. Ares has his own plans as he is trying to take down Aphrodite, she is using Kratos though to take him down. So you have your double crosses and such. Why is Kratos wanting revenge, well Ares tricked Kratos into killing his own family so there ya go. The combat in this game is very fun, simple to do yet it looks very cool. You do cool combos and nifty looking finisher type moves on various mythical creatures. You span a few levels as you start with a cool ship scene and also an attack on a city, you also have to go through this strange fortress on top **** back. My favorite level though is the hades level as it looks really awesome. Speaking of awesome, the graphics here are just that. From the giant Minotaur's, to the super scenery, and to the falling people in the hades level everything here looks exceptional. My only complaint is the rather short play time and the shortage of boss fights which is a shame, because the ones they do have are very fun. So for a fun game that offers a challenge, but does not make you rip your hair out give this game a try. Add to that you even get to see some boobies!!!. The one that started it all. I've played this many times and love it more and more everytime. 10/10. Absolute blast, the story, the gameplay and even the cutscene graphics for its time are amazing. This Franchise is the best out there. All phenomenal games especially the 2018 one.. One of the best games I've ever completed, story, character characterization, fighting, puzzles. Virtually everything perfect, not aged at all badly. Can't help but assume that hack and slash gets kind of boring, although GoW gets it just right. The urge to follow with the adventure is still a riddle for me, but I just love to beat them all to death. Not to talk about the bosses, they are amazing. Truly has some unforgettable moments.. 9/10, great start for the franchise, but can't feel this game is outdated, needs a remake. A beautiful game that starts one of the best game series of all time. I also think that it's still playable in 2022. Great combat mechanic, nice levels design, and epic boss fights. I didn't get a chance to play it when it first came out, but it must have been a legendary game for 2005.. This game is such an amazing. I like the story of sparta the god of ancient Greek. the gameplay it's stunning. This game is added to my favorite games I ever played.. A great game, an amazing story, Kratos is the best spartan warrior. I just Love it.. Highly Recommended : 10/10 1. Graphics : GOOD 2. Gameplay : GOOD Definitely worth a try !. The Sign of PlayStation. Good - linear fast paced action. No breaking of pace. - graphics are really nice. - combos feel fluent, and a having a parry system is great. - story is pretty interesting. - diverse amount of enemies. Petrifying effects, etc. - useful dodging abilities. - a large amount of moves and combos. - QTE feel great, and the animations with it look very cool. - adds enough puzzles to change things up, while keeping the fighting as the main focus. Bad - the lack of custom camera movement makes some platforming sequences look awkward.. The game is great , in my opinion the first version is better than the second version. Good graphics , addictive gameplay , epic and beautiful music , great sound , powerful and engaging story . And a masterpiece game!. Massovly overrated game. Full of badly ballamced sections and lazy, in acurate combat. Worst is the stuply designrx **** game was praised and saved by a big budget thay allowed for good visuals and Cutsceanes.. An extraordinary game for the time it was made. A game with a gameplay ahead of its time and very well done levels. A very good story for the time the game was released. The downsides are the game's parkour levels, which are extremely boring.. A PS2 greek god, a masterpiece by all means, bossfights soundtrack the game design the protaginist ofcourse .. Kratos. Amazing game, couldn't stop playing till it was complete. Some very challenging bosses that make you think.. God of war series is the best franchise exclusive on PlayStation. Fluid gameplay and satisfying gore hack and slash.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best game ever better than ps 4 games for these days i love it so much thbaks santa. All game designers must study the 1st section/hour/opener of God Of War. It was perfect game design and completely shows what the game has to offer. With that said, this game is almost perfect in its' entirety. The only thing I wish is that it had more replayability. It had something similar to a new game plus, but it was subpar. Regardless, this goes down in the list of top 100 greatest games of all time. It will be hard to dethrone it. It is easily the best god of war entry as well. Yes, even better than II, III, Ascension, PSP Origins collection, & Norse.. Just finished this classic and I can't say anything bad from this game. Although it has some mistakes, I understand that is an old game and the first God of War.. Absolutely fantastic game. Didn't age at all even though I'm playing decades apart. This is what a single player game should be! Perfect match of gameplay drives the story and story drives the gameplay! Superb loved it! Story is fantastic too, writing of this standards is missing nowadays. Terrific stuff! Advice to modern AAA Devs: In modern games, single player games are mostly game movies. Please learn from this game, how to have the perfect sync of yin & yang of gameplay + story. AWESOME! God of war!!!!. This game is a legend. Very fun and very enjoyable. Technically a legend for the year it came out. God of War - PlayStation 2 (8/10) .. One of the best Playstation 2 games ever. Death comes for the Greek pantheon in the form of The Ghost of Sparta.. God of War has entered one of the best series on the PlayStation console ever. So it's no wonder that I had to play this game and it didn't take long and that I fell in love with it. God of War (2005) is an excellent game. Right at the beginning of the game we get a smaller and quick talk of our main character Krata, what actually happened to him and it doesn't take long and the game throws us into action and yes, that's what's going on here. The game has an incredible dose of action. What's best is the fact that it's constantly improving. At the beginning of the game, we get Blades of Chaos, which are already enough OP at that time, but it's nothing compared to what they can be a few hours later, when we improve our character. Yes, there is character improvement. In addition to our weapons, we also improve our abilities, which also greatly help to make the action even better, and the Combo, which appears in the corner of the screen and forces you to constantly increase it, or in other words, constantly forces you to make bigger and bigger, helps you to do all this. paseku. Here and there there will be puzzles that will let us breathe from all the massacre we are experiencing in the game. It is located in a beautiful environment. Indeed, the locations here are phenomenal and especially the desert. I love the desert, so I especially liked it here and Medusa sings for us. Well, just beautiful! Of course, there will also be delicious Boss Fights, which also know no bounds. Especially the last one, but I won't spoiler. Perhaps I will just say that it was The Final Boss and the overall finish that was more than satisfactory in my eyes and I love the ending. For me, a great game that I recommend and a must for PlayStation 2 owners. In short, a MUST-PLAY title.. It is very curious, my first god of war that I played was GOW 2, and it was not that I met the first one, just after finishing GOW3, despite having played GOW1 years after its release date, I was shocked by this masterpiece , the story, the concept of the new god of war and creating a fictional mythology with kratos as a unique character, it is impressive .... you must play it Story 10 + Gameplay 10 Visuals 9 Music 10 Personal Score: 10+ A master piece. Awesome game with very good story. Its one of the best games ever and its enjoyable and after so many years. This game is by far the best game I have ever played on the PS2. It had all the elements you'd expect from a top rate title.. Gameplay..............Amazing Graphics................Amazing Story.......................Amazing Score.....................Amazing. godofwar best game ps2 best game ps3 best graphic ,best game play ,best story,lovely kratos. This was my first God of War game, I played it in hard mode and I played it in PS Now. It was epic, challenging and buggy but epic. The final battle was one of the longest and best ones I’ve ever played, and it was not only challenging but dramatic too, you need skills and a good strategy to finish the game, it’s not just a random hash and slash fight. The combat mechanics were really good with the only disadvantage of not being able to control the camera angles, the camera blinds you on purpose at times during the fights and that can become very frustrating because it is not about skill anymore but luck, you just end up pushing buttons blindly hoping to defend yourself or give a hit. Despite that it was really fun to play. The puzzles weren’t hard to crack but they weren’t easy either, they had the right balance, enough to challenge you and enough to progress further in the game. The story was impactful, is not deep and they don’t give you much but what they give is worth your while. I think the developers did a great job with the game despite all the technical issues, it was an epic adventure and I had a lot of fun playing it.. After having completed the game, I believe that it holds up pretty well. When the game first came out it was considered a masterpiece amongst many other at the time. I can confirm that this game is truly incredible providing a fantasy world based on one of the most well-known mythologies of all time. The way the story wraps up is truly beautiful and the gameplay set the stage for the new games","this is the game that gave me my love for the hack and slash genre . the game that got me into the GOW series, brutal and amazing game for any action lover ."
830.Dark Cloud 2,"This is my childhood game. It may not be a perfect game but what game is truly perfect? I remember sitting in front of my tv as a 8 year old boy going on such a great adventure and here I am at 29 getting the platinum trophy and reliving every bit of that magic. This game pioneered the world building genre in my opinion and is a fantastic jrpg that is so underrated. So please if you are reading this review please due this beautiful game a much needed favor and give it a chance.. Perfect in everyway, A timeless classic that has insane replay ability. Watching my son currently getting into it.. Best fishing in a video game, and surprisingly nothing's gotten close in 20 years. It even has a pokemon minigame for racing or showing off fish you catch.. The overall score is based on how much fun I personally had with every component of the game and the overall experience.. This is the first game I've ever played and it's still the love of my life.. Beautiful underrated masterpiece ****. Skip Dark Cloud 1 and play this one. This one is the good one. You don't even need to play the first game to understand this one. Dark Chronicle (A.K.A ""Dark Cloud 2"") trims the fat of the original, removes perma-breaking weapons so your progress doesn't just go out the window, and removes that annoying thirst meter. And in exchange, the combat has been immensely upgraded and the controls feel much more refined. Building weapons, upgrading a giant robot to pilot, being able to transform into monsters, and a more fleshed out Georama system make this game the definitive ""Dark Cloud"" experience.. The first game was a masterpiece. This is a game for children, repetitive, confusing and that has no connection with the first. Dark Cloud 2 is fantastically addicting, complex, long, and often very fun, though the amount of content it has to offer can be a bit unbalanced as a whole. This game has many layers to it. Of these layers are: - A story based on time travelling to reunite the main characters with their parents while saving the planet from chaos. I honestly played this game because my girlfriend had recommended it, and she originally played it just after she lost her mom, which kind of made it really sad, tbh. - Randomized dungeons with specific sets of objectives and enemies; This helps keep gameplay fresh. - There's an invention system that's impressively elaborate, involving taking potentially hundreds of pictures and combining these picture ideas to give the main character(s) the capacity to create important items and equipment, which can then be accomplished by combining materials. A good few pictures are miss-able, like pictures of bosses doing special attacks. - There's a very intricate leveling system to the weaponry with multiple paths that's a lot of fun to plan out. You can also transmute weapons into other weapons in order to maximize stats on your main weapons. (I had no clue about that for a while.) - There's a dynamic that lets you turn into creatures from dungeons after you effectively use the right lure on them to unlock the ability. Sadly, this is the most under-utilized aspect of the game, as most of these creatures become pointless to use towards the latter half of the game. Contrasting that, the roughly built mech you can use maintains significance as it becomes the fastest way to move in dungeons. If you're looking for a good retro game where you can transform into other creatures, Threads of Fate for PS1 was pretty interesting. - You can play an alternate version of golf in dungeons called Spheda, which is a combination of game mechanics I don't think I've ever seen anywhere else. This is actually really fun, as unexpected as it is in this type of game. Although! The randomization of levels may make it a total pain to complete this objective in certain areas, making the game feel severely unbalanced to complete 100%. Particularly, playing golf in the canyon area was daunting, since you have to clear out the area every time before you try again. - There's a town-building dynamic; You learn what objects you need to build by completing dungeons. Building these objects and having specific people move in to these locations then causes changes when travelling to the future that allow the main character to progress and acquire rare items. - You can fish. It's not my favorite part of the game, but it works. Overall there are a lot of optional tasks. - Many unique, unforgettable characters. - A quirky and endearing style, in terms of art, graphics, characters, voices, and plot choices. All of these elements come together to do an excellent job of pulling you into an alternate world. Strong recommendation.. I love the first Dark Cloud, and I am absolutely baffled at how much more popular the second game is by comparison. The is the most I’ll-designed game I’ve ever played. The combat system is entirely imbalanced—to level up my weapons, I basically just used the RidePod to kill everything and then switched characters to absorb the ABs. So what’s the point of having a variety of different weapons at all? The monster-transformation feature was phoned in—leveling was a grind, and they didn’t adapt the combat mechanics to the monsters you could fight as. For instance, to unlock a target, you have to press back+O, but when you do this with a monster, it just turns the character around (whereas the main characters stay facing the target), so it basically is impossible to unlock a target when using the monster transformation. There are a number of other oversights with the combat controls that should have been fixed before release (the changing camera orientation, for example, also screws up the combat direction-dependent combat controls). Overall, the big boast of the game is that it take like 300 hours for completionist runs, but this is only because the entire game is a numbingly tedious grind. I’m not sure why so many people like this game more than the first, but their opinions are bad and they should feel bad.. And excellent sequel to dark cloud 1 with improved graphics, voice acting, a better story and most importantly: less repetetive gameplay.. One of the best games i'd ever played. A game ahead of its time. Has many activities to do, ranging from fishing to the notorious spheda. there is a very consistent system of weapons evolution that is likely to please the majority, since it is simple, but well functional and dynamic. A great but underrated RPG. First role playing game I played in my life. After finishing it I fell in love with this genre... Adventure, customizing, good quests, the Georama mode (which was very well implented), the amount of content the video game has... It was such an epic adventure for the little kid I was. The graphics are beautiful, the dungeon design is good, I have no words for this game, it might not be a 10/10, but it's one of those video games that will have a space in my heart.. There are few experiences in my life that have left such a deep and permanent mark as when I first started playing Dark Cloud 2 all those years ago. To this day, the story, the characters, and specially the music still bring tears to my eyes every time I think back to the hundreds of hours I spent in the world of Monica and Maximilian. The game holds up incredibly well and is a true PS2 classic, a must-have for any collector worth it's salt and easily my number 1 pick for the best game of it's generation.. One of the deepest and most rewarding RPGs I've ever played. Everything in this game lines up to make for a wonderful experience. The music, graphics and gameplay all come together in a complete package that takes Dark Cloud 2 to new heights unseen by most games that came out during the PS2 era. (Which is saying something due to it's legendary game lineup.) This is definitely a must play and well worth owning for anyone who has a PS2 and even a passing interest in RPG games.. Charming story, great characters and vibrant cities and locations !! Everything is so colorful and full of life. The weapons building system is fun and diversified, and it can make you really over-powered if you grind it out. It does tend to be a little repetitive, but nothing like the first installment.. I love this game :D It´s so beautiful. The Cel-shading, the Battlesystem, the Feeling and last but not least the awesome Soundtrack made it to the best game ever made.. My real score back then would be a 8-9/10, but looking back I realized how utterly nostalgic I was for this game. It is as if there was endless content from building, dungeon crawling, golf, fishing, contests, customization, medals and more. The game is the most perfect RPG on the ps2 for me. The graphics were gorgeous and it had a great soundtrack that, in itself, sounds nostalgic. After downloading the ISO, I was able to finally finish the game that I was so determined to finish before my console broke before the very last boss in zelmite mines.. I love cel-shaded Level 5 RPG games. When I play one it feels like every day is my birthday. They're like Skittles candy. This game is a birthday cake, an infinite supply of salty tears to oceans everywhere in the universe. You better believe extraterrestrials are playing this, for they made this game.. An almost flawless game. Graphic are gorgeous, story is engaging and deep, main characters are well developed and very likable. Gameplay is rich and varied. The pacing can get a little slow at some points and the levels suffer from similar repetitiveness that the first game had. But, while these flaws are noticable they are also easily overlooked as there is enough variety in the level designs and side activities to keep you distracted. Overall: Dark Cloud 2 (or Dark Chronicle) is perhaps one of my favorite PS2 games. It has everything I want in a game, if not more. For me this is a classic that I can replay over and over and every moment is a joy.. Dark Cloud 2 has an amazing world you can lose your self in and there's just so much to do you'll never get board. the RPG mechanics are a little shallow and the UI is a little tricky to navigate near end game when you have hundreds of items, other than that i love this game. The only drawback to this game is the voice acting, but that isn't too important. Everything else about the game is unique and refreshing and enjoyable.. Dark Chronicle is an RPG adventure in its own class. The surroundings are great, both the music and the visuals. They managed to create a varied, interesting and immersive world on the PS2 hardware with something that can almost be considered revolutionary graphics back in 02. The way game just grabs hold of you and keeps you playing is great. This game joined by other great PS2 adventures makes the PS2 my favorite home console to this date.. Great game.. The joy of adventure, inventing, and saving the world are every kid's dream, by playing Dark Cloud 2, it felt as if those dreams came true for me. I love Dark Cloud 2's storyline and originality, not to mention the believable graphics and extras, no other game contains such a broad scope of things to do. Many games either focus on the battles or focus on the skill. Dark Cloud 2 contains a mixture of battles and skills and somehow it intertwines everything to the main plot of the story in a very easy to understand way. I was very sad when the game ended but was overjoyed to see that there was a ""epilogue"" chapter for Dark Cloud 1 fans =P I'm worried about Dark Cloud 3 though, it may not be able to pass up its predescessor since Dark Cloud 2 is just so good, especially after this long way all of us have become way too anxious. Nevertheless, this game is for anyone who loves adventure and the feel of actually being in the story!","""dark cloud 2"" is a timeless classic that has insane replay ability . the game is fantastically addicting, complex, long, and often very fun . the story based on time travelling to reunite the main characters with their parents ."
831.GRID (2008),"Essentially Dirt on asphalt, if that game was the next gen version of Colin McRae, this is the next gen version of TOCA Touring cars with lots of contact, crashes and spins. Not as polished and more rough and ready than the likes of Gran Turismo and Forza but more enjoyable for it, and you cannot upgrade your car to victory making it a lot more skilful. A challenging and fun racing sim.. Absolutely terrible. Controls are way too sensitive and it's almost impossible to drive cleanly. The original GRID is a very good simcade racer. What makes GRID so unique is the fact that you can have your own racing team and hire/fire teammates,buy cars for the team to use in races,and manage **** aim is to become the biggest racing team in the world. GRID plays very well,with responsive controls,and grippy (if at times sensitive) **** car list is small,but all cars are **** track list and variety of race types is great too,keeping the gameplay fresh for a good chunk of **** damage modelling is great aswell GRID does look a bit dated graphically,but for a game that released in 2008,it looks pretty **** framerate runs at a solid 60. Sound design and soundtrack are great.Intense music plays in the background in critical races,adding to the intensity and immersion. The original GRID is a great game,and remains so to this day,but I feel Autosport is slightly better than this.That said,you won't go wrong with the original GRID at all.. Really cool game if you're an expert gamer. I am unable to enjoy the basic level .... it's waaaayyyyy tooo hard, so i'm unable to enjoy this game. And forget about letting my non-gamers try playing it ... they'd never make a first turn. What a shame, the game looks good but it's simply too difficult to actually enjoy.. GRID might be my favourite racing game of all time. I picked it up on a whim, when I had walked into an EB Games on my way home from work to check a release date on another game. GRID had come out that day, and while it had been on my radar a little bit, but I'd barely thought about it. My choice to pick it up instead of putting $5 bucks down on a pre-order was a really good one. Keep in mind, it's not Forza, it's not GT, it's not one of those $500 racing sims for PC. What GRID is, is the soul of driving put into a video game. This is the game Jeremy Clarkson would promote if he could play video games. Great physics, great soft-body car damage, amazing graphics, top notch soundtrack (I've never liked menu music so much before, it's really very odd). Everything about GRID is just FUN. It's not a science sim, it's not Twisted Metal, it's right dead-centre in between. And because of that, I consider it almost perfect.. If you think Grid 2 is fun but has room for improvement, you should try this! Somehow the Codemasters team perfected something five years ago which they struggle to achieve now. Seriously, Grid is better than Grid 2 in every respect and also one of the finest racers of this generation of consoles.. GRID is one of the best racing games this generation, perhaps one of the greatest of all time, and how? Because its simple. GRID is a simulation racer at its core, you build a career from the ground up, assemble a team to race on real world tracks in licensed cars across several different kinds of events such as Touring Cars, Drift, Formula 3 and Le Mans series. However what it does is it cuts away the fat of games like Gran Turismo and Forza but not including things such as car customisation and having a much smaller selection of cars to race in providing much closer competition between racers both online and in singleplayer as you are racing exactly the same machines, no-one has an advantage and everyone is as likely to win as each other meaning its pure driving skill that determines whether you win a race or crash and burn in the gravel at the edge of the track. Though GRID is massivley smaller in terms of content compared to GT or Forza it will easily last you a good 20 hours for the singleplayer and even longer for the infinitely re-playable online modes. You must get known, make a team and earn a pro licence in all 3 regions (US, Europe and Japan) not to mention collect all the cars and sponsors. GRID is the perfect simulation racing game for someone who is perhaps not the biggest fan of sitting in menu's fine tuning every single minor detail of their ride yet still provides a satisfying and exhilarating experience for those that do like depth in their racers.. On one hand, this game is technically a marvel. The graphics are lovely, the sheer number of vehicles available is rather impressive, especially considering the level of detail that went into them, the physics and control is nigh perfect, the AI in this game, while a tad aggressive at least doesn't suffer from rubber banding at all, and the flashback function where you can return to a previous section of your race is brilliant. As a long time racing fan, this game seemed like everything I was waiting for. Uuuuuuntil I got into the races. There is a reason that street racing games such as Need for Speed have short races, it's because it's a small number of cars on large open tracks with somewhat arcade-y physics and aggressive tendencies. It works for them. In a touring car race with up to twenty vehicles in a race on the other hand, you NEED to have more than two laps, personally I'd put AT LEAST five laps, otherwise it turns into a manic dash to the finish and all skill in the race has exited with nary a farewell. The vast majority of tracks are well-designed, but again, thanks to the lap system, some of them just don't work, particularly the urban ones such as San Francisco and that blasted dock area in Japan. And that leads directly to my BIG complaint, the Japanese circuit. Now, don't get me wrong, some of the tracks are good, and I personally enjoy the idea of touge, a duel-based racing system that goes down and up mountain roads. However... to put it politely, the NIGHT touge, where there are cars on the track, can piss off. And drifting, oooooh.... oooh drifting. Allow me to speak very bluntly: drifting IS NOT RACING. It is an automotive showboating technique, equivalent to aerobatics and gymnastics, and while it is entertaining to watch and takes skill, it does not belong in a racing game! At least a game like Need For Speed has the excuse of it being part of the culture, in Grid it's just completely out of place. I hate drift competitions, with a burning passion, and the fact that about half of the early Japanese circuit includes drifting... well... I decided to completely IGNORE the Japanese circuit for as long as possible. I was under the impression that this was a professional game, and yet here it is, presented as if it's equal to the Le Mans circuit or open wheel racing. At least there weren't any oval racing Now, on to the rest. The idea to let you choose a name and nationality is actually quite interesting, and not from the idea of having a name to go off of in the races, but rather the fact that you have an auditory name. Throughout the game, you have a crew chief and a team manager who both refer to you by name, and to their credit they're competently voice acted--even the various teammates you can get are reasonably well-designed, though the first guy you get--inevitably a pathetic Englishman that sounds like he just joined racing yesterday--will make you want to flatten his face with a cricket bat. However, there is one problem with the voice acting, and it's tied to one of the more impressive facets of the game. Throughout the game, you'll notice that different teams have different skill levels, including a variety of high-tier ""ace teams"" for lack of a better term. The top of these is ""Ravenwest Motorsports"" and to be perfectly honest, they're downright impressive in their programming. However, again they have the lap issue where you need time to beat them, something you usually don't have. And then there's your crew chief... oh the crew chief. Throughout the game he shows himself as being confident but supporting, cautious but only intelligently so. When Ravenwest comes around, he turns into a pansy. ""Uh oh, Ravenwest are in this one. We'll shoot for third."" That's literally what he says, and it makes me a lot angrier than it should. It shows a self-esteem hero-worship issue with this game. Some people may complain about product placement, but I get the feeling that was what funded this game in the first place. So overall, this game is technically competent and actually quite impressive and, usually entertaining, but so many little details were skimped on and unnecessary additions that get in the way of the entertainment.. For an arcade game it's brilliant, it has got a great driving engine, it looks great on par with driving games of the same time period and I am especially impressed with the car damage. I has got a few glitches but none are game breaking. Great multiplayer experience, easy to learn hard to master like it should be. AI is not very good though, even on a high difficulty they drive like drunk grammas they break early and acceleratre late and worst of all they ignore the player. I shouldn't be complaining about the campaign mode on an arcade racing game but since they included one why not, it's so repetitive, in order to gain 100% completion you are going to grind season after season after season just to get your rating up, really annoying. Despite my lazy review I really enjoy playing this game and in the end of the day that is what counts.. Really enjoy this one but it is a bit hard to get over the AI cars tank like prowess and the faster the cars get the more annoying the differential. Honestly love the Destruction derby racing, makes me remember hours of fun linking up two playstations to play destruction derby. If you don't like muscle cars however this is not the game for you.. I so much want to enjoy this game but the number of spin outs at low speed is causing me to turn it off as soon as I turn it on. Even slight collisions cause me to ram head first into railings. Gorgeous graphics but frustrating as hell.. GRID may not be greatest racer of 2008, but it is indeed the most fun. Grid is not one of those racers that pursue realistic driving mechanics or true to life physics. In fact, physics and driving have been blown out of proportion to give us a racer that that defines pure entertainment. Grid was built on the EGO engine, which powered Colin Mcrae: Dirt. The engine went through a complete overhaul to suit Grid's needs. The handling mechanics have been tweaked, to give Grid more of an arcade feel. The damaging model has returned from Dirt, which makes collisions cinematic and authentic. You will find yourself making use of the flashback feature to view your crashes over and over again, along with restarting at a point before the collision and learn from your previous mistake. Grid has a lengthy career mode that includes, point-to-point races, time trials, drifting and demolition derbies. A great inclusion was the Le Mans 24 hour, but it does get repetitive from time to time. The game does have some minor drawbacks, such as a low car count. There are 45 premium cars to be unlocked, but it just never feels like enough. However, Codemasters has released DLC which will up that number, assuming you are willing to pay for it, of course. Another annoyance, is the voiceovers, which becomes stale a few races into the game. One will get tired of hearing the same commands being repeated throughout the lengthy career. Nonetheless, this is a fun, adrenalin pumping racer that will appeal to casual and hardcore gamers alike. Even if you have a vague interest in track racing, I suggest you go out and purchase Grid. Trust me, it will be worth your while.. The damage is amazingly good, graphics are awesome, viewpoints from racing are great, plenty of racetypes (Formula 3, Drifting, Touring Cars, Stock cars ect ect...) and the tracks are quite challenging, on the downsides sometimes the AI screws up a bit, and a certain team there are, lets say ""unfairly powerful"" which makes racing against them quite **** overall well worth the buy. Gran Turismo, in my eyes, was the king of all ""realistic"" racers. GRID has satisfied my ""realistic"" racing needs, when 360 is missing a great racer like Gran Turismo. You can look up any youtube video, and watch game play from this game and see how amazing the graphics are. The racing is solid, not unresponsive at all. Every car feels like it races different. I like that about a game, adds some more difficulty so you don't zoom through the game. It is not a very deep game, for instance, like Gran Turismo. Though, it has it's own core experience and it's own depth that goes great with the game flow. Since the recent lackluster Need for Speed games, GRID is an awesome choice if you are looking for a racing game to kill time.","Essentially Dirt on asphalt is the next gen version of TOCA Touring cars with lots of contact, crashes and spins . controls are way too sensitive and it's almost impossible to drive cleanly . GRID might be my favourite racing game of all time ."
832.Kingdom Hearts II,"The first time I played Kingdom Hearts 2 was 12 years ago, when my friend Dan lent me his physical copy for the PS2 after I had enjoyed the first game like a child. I remember that few times in my life have I felt such excitement to start a sequel as I did on that occasion. And it did not disappoint. The game’s opening/tutorial is not only the best in the saga, but one of the best in video game history. What a brilliant way to introduce the mechanics and immerse you in one of the most iconic ****, 10 years later, I’ve had the chance to enjoy the original game again, this time with a slightly different perspective, but with the same thrill I felt back in 2013. It’s hard to pinpoint the best thing about this game because it simply does so many things **** combat is dynamic, challenging, and keeps you hooked thanks to new mechanics like forms, summons, spells, and action commands, which make the gameplay much more fluid and exciting. The variety of Disney worlds is remarkable, and their design faithfully captures the essence of each one. Additionally, the Spanish dubbing — sadly lost in the remakes — is outstanding and a reminder of the incredible quality of voice work we have in **** short, Kingdom Hearts 2 is a game ahead of its time, yet timeless, because it feels just as fresh and enjoyable as the day it was released. My only recommendation, if you want to play it, is to get a copy of the original PS2 version with its original dubbing and dive into one of the best games of its generation.I consider the Kingdom Hearts saga one of my favorites, and I’ve always feared that going back to it after so many years, now as an adult, might make it lose its charm or that the complexity of its story would put me off. However, Kingdom Hearts 2 has slapped me in the face to remind me that this will never happen. Thank you, Kingdom Hearts 2, for your wonderful story, flawless gameplay, incredible variety of worlds, and revolutionary mechanics for its time.. The absolute perfect Action **** me personally this is the pinnacle of video games, the best game ever made. I could go on forever.. My favorite game of all time. Amazing story, the characters had dope outfits, the music.. Gameplay is the best in the series. 10/10 would replay it again and again until the end of time.. Kingdom Hearts 2 has the best gameplay system implemented in the entire series. Though this released in 2005 it holds up well to this day and is better than a lot of modern day games. Story is excellent and characters are lovely and boss fights are amazing. Would always recommend.. After waiting 3 years since the release of KH1 the game started out a little bit confusing. Where is Sora was my first thought as 358/2 was not even released yet?? Gradually progressing the story it finnaly became clear and damn, what a story, what a game. To this day I still go back to play KH2 as the gameplay is nearly perfect. Nothing will ever top KH2.. My hype for this game was through the roof when it first came out. Considering how hyped I was, I was quite disappointed, especially with some aspects of the story that felt quite incomplete (but was improved in the Final Mix version). Gameplay is fun, but in some ways felt simplified from the original game, especially the triangle mechanic. Overall, an average entry in the series.. Does what a proper sequel should - elevates what made the predecessor great while getting rid of what didn't work. Everything fires on all cylinders to make on of the most enjoyable and heartfelt gaming experiences out there.. It is definitely one of the best games of all time. For me, even in 2024 and after finishing the game many times, it still gives me the feeling of the first experience. It really deserves the title **** and wonderful classic game.. A harbinger for things to come, a complication on the story and combat of the original game. Offering a bit for those keeping up with lore established in supplemental material and offering a lot for anyone who wanted the combat to be more of a button mashing visual spectacle, still enjoyable but not as charming.. This is probably nostalgia bias, but not only is this my favorite childhood game, it's my favorite game of all time. From the super fun action gameplay (especially the boss battles) to the godlike OST (all the boss tracks were sick too), Kingdom Hearts II is the best KH game and the series peaked here honestly. The story is even easy to follow in this one (for the most part), especially compared to games that'd come after this one. Plus the game's final boss battle is one of the most epic moments from my childhood. I've replayed this game countless times over the years and it looks pretty impressive for a PS2 game. I'll never get tired of this timeless classic.. After playing Kingdom Hearts I, I can say that this game is far way better than its predecessor. The combat has improved a lot: it's more close to be a hack'n slash, more agile and with more variety of combos. I would like to highlight how great are all of the combats against the members of the Organization XIII (especially my beloved Marluxia). The story is really interesting, sometimes a bit confusing, but really enjoyable and with a deeper treatment, both in the storyline and in all the characters development. If you liked Kingdom Hearts I, this is just the improved version of that game in all of its aspects. Recommended!. I love love love the combat in Kingdom Hearts 2. The game on display here is phenomenal. The extra activities, the boss fights, the secrets! (Sephiroth) All of it is polish to shining tee! The story is hilarious. Maybe it wasn't trying to be, but it was. If you try to take the game seriously you're not gonna have a great time, but if you just go in for fun? Kingdom Hearts 2 is an absolute banger!. After revisiting the original release of kingdom hearts 2 on PS2 in 2023, this game still remains one of the best actionRPGs I have ever played. The simple yet complex gameplay remains one of this games defining characteristics, and is still worth playing today (the final mix version, that is). it was perfect perfect everything down to the last minor details. Fixes every little issue i have for the original, making this the best game i have ever played.. Very memorable. Kingdom Hearts 2 may very well be one of if not the best game of all time. The story is infinitely better than the first, and same goes for the gameplay. One would be unable to revisit the original after playing this. The storytelling is amazing in the way that everything is explained by the ending, and everything is wrapped up in a perfect bow. This game is true greatness.. PS4 version here. This game is a huge step up from Kingdom Hearts 1. They improved everything including combat, story and characters. Took me about 40h. I only did the main story plus several side quests, but I'm very far from full completion (and will not do it).. A truly incredible sequel. Arguably better than the original, but to me the story of KH1 was better & overall was the more profound/groundbreaking game. Still, a true classic.. Perfect sequel to the first chapter, it does not only build a great story with some good twists, but the gameplay is so good and so much better than kh1, after so many years it is still very funny and so much responsive. An absolutely must for everyone who played the first chapter!. Nearly perfect game. The only issue is the Disney worlds not having any substance and feeling like filler episodes of rehashed Disney movies plots. I'll say this with all of my heart. Kingdom Hearts 2 is the best game through it's 20+ year history! The combat, the music, the characters, the story. Holy moly it's so good. The game is so good that I've played it twice on a harder difficulty. If you have a PS2 around your own home, go get it and play Kingdom Hearts 2.. Best game in the franchise, fun gameplay and walkthrough, the plot is still hard to follow, but we love the saga just for that. THIS IS KINGDOM HEARTS.. Simply amazing. Even if the playability is exactly the same as the previous game, the history is perfect.. A upgraded version of KH1, but you also get Drive Form Sora, which doesn't get old.. This is a much better game than the original in terms of gameplay I like that it was easier to follow as in the first game I got lost a couple of times and needed a guide to progress in the story. The only bad thing was the need to use a new mechanic to gain abilities. All in all, this is an excellent sequel that years later is still fun to play.. If Kingdom Hearts was a good foundation for a series, Kingdom Hearts II was a near perfection of it. Practically every single aspect from the first game has been taken here and improved upon, with one or two exceptions. The story is a good follow-up to KH and Chain of Memories, introducing new elements and characters that flow very well throughout the campaign. Voice acting has been improved upon, holding up even better than KH. The character models and environments still look good for being a PS2 game, similar to that of the first game. However, the facial animations are still the same mixed bag that they've been for over ten years, at least until Kingdom Hearts III came along. I've heard a lot of people complain about how Sora sounds in this game, but I have the opposite problem. i find Sora's voice slightly annoying in the first game, but in this one he sounds more mature and just better all around. The worlds in this game have both been improved and degraded from the first game. In one area, getting lost almost isn't a thing anymore, thanks to two new additions from Square-Enix: The Minimap and the objective bar. These were two of the smartest additions to the series as a whole. However, the worlds have lost some of the verticality they had in KH. everything is more flat, and less interesting. It's not to the level that Birth By Sleep is, but it's a little disappointing. However, in the grand scheme of the whole game, it isn't the biggest problem, and The World that Never Was (the final level) is incredibly fun to explore, so it hasn't all been lost. The combat in this game is one of the biggest improvements brought to this game. It blows KH's combat out of the water, with an improvement of movement speed, agility, and aerial combat. You have your standard stuff like the Keyblade, Magic, and Limits, but there are more skills for the Keyblade than ever before, making fights a beautiful dance of flying around the screen beating everything up with an oversized key. The best new addition comes in Drive forms: temporary powerups that change Sora's fighting style drastically, upping the style factor. Leveling up these forms also gets you new agility moves, like ground dashes, air spins, high jumps, dodge rolls, and flying. There is so much you can do, it may feel overwhelming at first, but once you get into the flow, everything falls into place. The bossfights are incredible. Each is distinctive from the last, bringing something new to the table. the Heartless bossfights are good as usual, but the ones that really stand out are against a group introduced in Chain of Memories: Organization XIII. Each member you fight has a new moveset, making them always feel fresh. Two of them in particular are immense challenges. You may be stuck on them for a very long time. You may feel like giving up, but they can be beat, and once you do, it's one of the best feelings in gaming. The final boss especially is one of the best I have seen in gaming. It's dynamic, interesting, full of cool set pieces, and a real challenge that once you get to the very end of, you reach one of the best moments (that I won't spoil) I have ever witnessed. This game is kind of hard to jump into if you don't know the stories of Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, but if you do or don't care about story, this game is a near masterclass ****, one that would establish a baseline that every time a new Kingdom Hearts game came out, people would point to KHII as the golden standard it had to live up to.. Made me feel like a kid again, 10/10 would get confused about the story again.. It's my childhood and still I can't get enough of this game, the best Kingdom Hearts, fun and it's a challenge in high difficulties.. I’m currently playing this game for the 4th time. This game holds a special place in my heart and I will always remember the first time I played it. There is magic to this game that I just cannot explain. It has that old school Disney feeling. Magic….. The sprinkles of Final Fantasy is wonderful and is what was missing from KH3. I play this game on Proud mode because it’s not a button masher on harder difficulties. I owe my favorite game of all time a review and I hope anyone interested in finally playing this series, has an absolutely memorable time just as I had. 10/10 game for me. Every time I hear classical music I think of this game. It’s just wonderful.. 60/100 Kingdom Hearts 2's story is an enchanting chronicle that blends the dreamy-like mood of a fairy tale with the cheesy, spectacular epicness of an anime, sustained and tied together by a powerful emotional core elevated by unique memorable music. Superbly directed scenes that can deliver and convey the tender, melancholic drama amidst the wacky, bizarre concepts of its world and lore, thanks to both being inextricably tied together. Alas, in gameplay, we instantly notice that Level Design got a massive downgrade. The intricate, fun maps of KH1 have been replaced with dull hallways and hollow rooms, with chests scattered here and there in esthetically pleasing but structurally barren environments, with only a single optional area providing any engaging platforming. The game experience is saved and recontextualized thanks to the absolute beauty of Combat: the already incredibly snappy and fluid base combos are the solid ground on top of which an exciting amount of engaging heterogeneous possibilities are stacked. On top of Abilities, Magic and Summons, Fusions and Limits have been introduced. Fusions especially significantly change the gameplay with different playstyles while also providing a new layer of strategic resource management to progression, as Limits offer an additional, tangential support. All these new additions are perfectly balanced, to be upgraded and unleashed against a strongly diversified army of enemies and bosses as the various levels countinuously add new twists and variations to the battle formula to keep things fresh through new attack patterns or external gimmicks, with the only serious flaw being the oversimplified, underdeveloped Reaction Commands (It must be also noted that enemy pose a meaningful, satisfying challenge only on Critical Mode). The game also offers an incredible amount of thrilling, greatly polished optional bosses to push the player's skills to their limit after the main campaign. Gummiship sections have been made much more enjoyable thanks to a faster pace and more visual flare.. This is one of the best games I have ever played. So many good memories from playing it when I was a kid. Story was fantastic and so was the game play.. Kingdom hearts 2 is by far the best game in the series, its hard to not like it if you are a fun of disney and Final Fantasy universe.. Of all the action RPGs I've played, this is among the unforgettable. This is the only game I've played in the series and I was still blown a way by heart and soul put into this game. A rare mix of old Disney movies, anime-style storytelling, and brilliant action RPG mechanics. It's a formula that never should have worked, but the writers and programmers gave everything personal attention. Not only am I playing through a soothing story with an anime setting, but I'm also experiencing the nostalgia of all my old favorite Disney movies, even the ones I haven't seen in ages. And that nostalgia is like meeting up with an old friend. I haven't played the first game in the series, but the flash backs tell me everything I need to know. I understand all these charters thanks to excellent emotion animation. It's a moving sensation, to feel connected to something you've only known for a little while. When my eyes caught those gorgeous levels, the creative designs of the villains and the Heartless...I was thunder struck.. my favorite game of all time i need to have 75 words so here we go jhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. This game is so difficult All the bosses and enemy’s and I’m not even playing on proud mode or anything I had just Beaten three of the big headless in the cave of wonders chasm of challenges and once I had better it I had saved it but when I opener the game another time the save data was gone. Kingdom Hearts II is a very strong, though somewhat inconsistent sequel to the surprise hit that was Kingdom Hearts. Kingdom Hearts II vastly improves on its predecessor's battle system to deliver the best pure gameplay thus far in the franchise, though its narrative goes a bit off the rails in the latter stages. Kingdom Hearts II is where the franchise really began to pull away from a simple and fun story-line to something more convoluted and pretentious, though the game still thankfully finds its sense of charm. It also begins with the most infamously tedious tutorial section; a mind-numbingly dull three-hour story segment with boring mini-games. Furthermore, Kingdom Hearts II is relatively light on side content, and what is there is fairly bland. However, its vastly superior upgraded version, Kingdom Hearst II: Final Mix, solves this issue in spades.. A great aesthetic, engaging combat, and corny cut scenes that can surprisingly subvert your expectations at times. Also packs an absolutely beautiful soundtrack.. I have no idea where to start with Kingdom Hearts II. What stands out is the excellent graphics, catchy voice actors, the amazing gameplay, and a wonderfully mysterious story. I will do my best to explain the plot of KHII. It's been a while since Sora, Donald, and Goofy defeated Ansem, and it appears that the Heartless are back to their old tricks, but before we learn of them, we see a new, and mysterious enemy: The Nobodies. Also different, the first 4 to 5 hours of gameplay are spent playing as a new character, Roxas. For a while, the story will seem confusing, but once you reach the end, it will ALL make sense. After a few hours of gameplay, you'll play as Sora once again, and you'll meet old and new friends alike. Also going on as a side story, Kairi has forgotten all about Sora, but is eager to learn more about 'the boy I used to have so much fun with', and Riku seems to be gone without a trace. Meanwhile, Roxas (who sounds eerily like Jesse McCartney *wink*) has been dreaming about Sora, and his past adventures, despite never having met him before, and while all this is going on, a mysterious new force called Organization XIII is taking shape.... The gameplay behind KHII is phenomenal. Rather than the basic play behind KHI, the system has been overhauled with a new thing called drive form, which allows Sora to increase his power for a limited time. The MP gauge is also different, which isn't that great. It's the only flaw of KHII. You'll be hooked within minutes of playing this game. With appearances from the Disney classic characters Beast, Belle, Cogsworth, Lumiere, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Aladdin, Jasmine, Genie, The Peddler, Iago, Chicken Little, Peter Pan, Stitch, Mulan, Captain Shang, Simba, Nala, Timon, Pumbaa, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Minnie Mouse, Daisy Duck, Chip and Dale, Hercules, Megara, Phil the Satyr, Ariel, Sebastian, Flounder, King Triton, Tron, Jack Skellington, The Mayor, Sally, Dr. Finkelstein, Lock, Shock, and Barrel. Disney's villains are also back, including Captain Barbossa, Jafar, Shan-Yu, Hades, Scar, Commander Sark, The Master Control Program, Oogie Boogie, and Ursula. Square's Final Fantasy heroes are back as well, including Squall Leonhart, Aeris (Aerith), Cloud, Auron, Yuffie, Tifa Lockheart, Raijin, Fujin, Seifer, Yuna, Rikku, and Paine, not to mention the most evil villain in video game history, Sephiroth is back. Kingdom Hearts II also has some cool voice actors, including Haley Joel Osment, Hayden Panitierre, David Gallagher, Sean Astin, Jesse McCartney, David Boreanaz, James Arnold Taylor, Tara Strong, B.D. Wong, Mena Suvari, and Robbie Benson. This is one game you cannot afford to miss. If you play one game on PS2 this year, Kingdom Hearts II should be that game. Don't miss this clever blend of fun, epic battles, romance, action, adventure, humor, and gripping suspense. 10/10 --spy. When I thought kingdom hearts 1 was the Best game aver then i played this. Best game Ever. 10/10 Favorite RPG of all-time. This game has a phenomenal story, and phenomenal everything.. Well If I would give kingdom hearts 1 an 8 and If I think kingdom hearts 2 is better in almost every single way then I'd give it a 9 lol overall fun story, amazing and fun and smooth gameplay that ages very well, and it gives you so much more freedom and don't even get me started on the ost in conclusion very good game.. KH2 has good combat, story pacing, good bosses, and does everything better than 1. Still KH1 is a good game, and KH3 pales in comparision to them.. Truly a masterpiece and a landmark for the Playstation 2-era. Kingdom Hearts II improves heavily on all of the shortcomings of the original and ends up an even more satisfying crossover between Disney and Final Fantasy characters. The gameplay is still the gold standard that the rest of the series is held to and the OST for the game might possibly be Yoko Shimomura’s finest work ever. The prologue, while the longest in the series, also succeeds where most other sequels fail when introducing a new main character that parallels / rivals the previous one in Roxas. By the end of the prologue, his story makes you feel sympathy for someone who was never meant to exist. The Disney worlds have lost the incessant platforming and exploration of the first game and now retain a more simple layout but now features a mandatory second visit after the midpoint of the game. The Disney bosses in the game are also vast improvement on top of introducing live-action worlds into the series such as Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean. The various minigames throughout the game are also vast improvements from the first and Coliseum now returns in the form of the Underdrome and Hades Paradox Cups, which also blow the ones from Kingdom Hearts out of the water. In conclusion, Kingdom Hearts II is still holds the title of the best game in the series and a genuine masterpiece of the 2000’s. It is by far the best licensed video game ever made.. The best game of all time! Insane gameplay, insane music, story is not for everyone but I love it so much!. Phenomenal, one of the best games ever made. Even after all these years the game has aged marvelously.. I finished Kingdom Hearts 2 a few days ago and I have mix feelings about this game ! I find that Square Enix better developed their Final Fantasy franchise than Kingdom Hearts. I liked to explore the different Disney Worlds but I found the game really linear. Some boss fights were interesting but overall, there was a lot of button mashing and you have a giant difficulty spike at the end of the game I found the game charming and there is an abundance of worlds. I appreciated most of the mini-games and the music as well. For a 2006 game, it's certainly above average but I saw way better games in this era (Paper Mario Thousand Year door, FF9 and 10) For me, this game is a 6,6/10 The reason why I played this game and KH1 is to better understand and appreciate KH3 that I also purchased. This game is an absolute masterpiece and a master class on how to make a better sequel. Everything about the gameplay as been refined and improved on from the first game in every aspect. The combat is way more fun, magic is fun to use and the story is engaging and rewarding especially if you’ve played the previous games. While it isn’t without it’s flaws like the 3 hour tutorial. I still believe this is square’s magnum opus and my favourite game of all time. Review for the final mix version: The gameplay is the best it's ever been and probably ever will of the KH series. Same goes for the music. The endgame content is orgasmic, with 15 optional bosses that are very different and mostly well designed and fun to learn. The story is probably the weakest point of the game, and the world building is surpassed both by KH1 and KH3, but everything else makes up for it.. It definitely has flaws, but that doesn't stop it from being the best game I've played. It will always have a prominent place in my heart.. after several years this game is still the best in the series rarely i played a so good game like this, my congratulations to the deplovers and the rest who created this game. This is, in my opinion, the BEST KINGDOM HEARTS GAME ever, the characters are very well made, the combat system works amazingly , and the cutscenes and story gets more open (and sometimes confusing) for the kingdom hearts saga, and it has in my opinion, one of the best villains on a videogame, Organization XIII, because every character has it's own personality and attacks. This game is unique.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I just got platinum on this game and I can honestly say that even though it is slightly better than the first game, it's still garbage. I can't tell you how many times I would tell Sora to jump and he wouldn't (like on the skateboard delivery minigame at the beginning) or spam triangle to grind during the 5,000 point challenge and he would just land on it like I never even pressed triangle. It's like the inputs often don't work in this game. Couple that with the bosses constantly becoming invincible for no reason at 1hp for a while. They'll just continuously eat attacks without defending and won't die. This can be especially annoying during the data battles, for example. What sets this game apart from the first is the improved gummi ship missions, and even though the worlds seem rehashed - the story is definitely improved upon. Sadly the trash mechanics couldn't make up for that and now that the platinum is in my rear-view mirror I will never pick up this game again. I can only hope that the third one isn't as bad as the first two, because I'm a big Disney/FF fan and love games in this genre.. There weren't enough vine sections. Massive downgrade from the first game. Dissapointing. My favourite Kingdom Hearts Just take the first Kingdom Hearts and make it better in every way.. This game is a masterpiece. Every single world, boss fight, animation, cutscene and the story itself have so much effort brimming out of every corner. The combat is fast, fluid, and stylish, the disney worlds are absolutely beautiful with so much content put in each one. The game may start out slow but when it gets going, IT GETS GOING. The story itself takes almost 30 hours to beat and none of it gets old ever. The soundtrack is the greatest in any video game ever (in my opinion) and the story is so sweet, well paced, and good, that the ending made me cry. Thats not even including all the bonus stuff that came in the final mix version. 13 new bosses with new moves, attacks, and phases along with a really long dungeon that takes advantage of all of sora's moves brilliantly and all the disney character summons and limits fit each character perfectly. If you havent already buy this game NOW. You will not regret it. (also the ps4 collection this game comes in is only like 30 bucks and it has 5 more games seperate from this game so buy that collection and play this game there you will not regret it). One of the best KH ever, though FM is a 11/10 I still recommend to play the original. Awsome game. My favourite. Plot is so thrilling! Gameplay is fixed (I didin't like gameplay of KH1 or Chain of Memories). All Disney worlds are so cool and so big. I had play this game three times. Once the original one on PS2, once the Final Mix on PS2 and once the Final Mix on PS4.. Kingdom Hearts 2 is a well crafted game and in my opinion one of the best action rpg's to date. If you like Action RPG's, Disney or Anime, I really recommend to give it a shot. The game is being remastered for current gen systems like PS4 or Xbox one where it runs in smooth 60 fps which makes the experience even better. If you want to understand the story though, I would recommend to play Kingdom Hearts 1 and Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories first. Your best place is the game ""Kingdom Hearts: The Story so Far"" which includes the whole franchise except Kingdom Hearts 3.. In 2004, My grandfather suffered a stroke while tending to his garden. I often wondered what that was like, what it felt like to be completely helpless and lose control of part of your brain. Now I know. Now I know what that is like. I have played Kingdom Hearts II on critical mode, and I now understand what it is like to be infirm. Do not play this game.. THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER. Okay, so a bit of this is from nostalgia, but oh man Kh2 is the bee’s knees. Every single thing in this game (besides atlantica) is absolutely phenomenal, from the music to the gameplay, to the cringed childish story. I don’t care, but this is my favorite game of all time.. Disney and Square Enix have done it again with their sequel to their massive surprise hit. Though the story can get a bit confusing and some levels are a bit annoying to get through. The new worlds, bosses, music, and new characters are truly a great reason to experience this game if you loved the first one.. It's amazing how much you can evolve a game, How much they improved to combat is spectacular that first game still has it been up points like exploring and how did game play can't feel sometimes but is a big improvement, this is an important game for me one of the first game I completed and I love it very dearly. In this KH the character felt weird and the relationship between Sora and Riku is so annoying and i really didn't enjoy the combat system specially when you have to finish the boss with the final hit of the combo that's just stupid.. Kingdom hearts 2 is the one kingdom hearts game iv played the most. Replaying the song in a new game plus is always thirilling an always will be. Amazing graphics heart warming story fun battles and mini games. My newer favorite characters added in 2 are Roxas and axle. Winnie the Pooh is one of my favorite storyline parts to play Imagine the graphics now if it was completely remade all the words popping off the pages would look so much more amazing.. This game is absolutely captivating, a big step up from kingdom hearts I. Everyone is older, the story takes many twists and turns that leave you guessing and wanting to know more. Overall, the gameplay is great, the keyblade forms are fun and look sick, tons of fun bosses and mechanics to figure out. The story is great and is weaved into the game beautifully with unique worlds like Twilight Town, Hollow Bastion, and The Word that Never Was. The Disney worlds are not overwhelming in nature and are fun to go through. The characters and feels this game will make you feel is off the charts. I have no complaints about any part or elements of this game, you will enjoy every bit of it and feel very invested in its characters and story. The gameplay is also very challenging at times for those who seek more of a challenge in combat with many secret bosses and arena fights.. Absolutely phenomenal game with off the charts gameplay and a great story. Definitely recommend it. Even now in 2020 this game looks amazing, a really masterpiece in all ways: plot, graphics, gameplay. Is a shame that some people don’t try this game for the existence of Disney’s characters, with the i","the game's opening/tutorial is not only the best in the saga, but one of the best in video game history . combat is dynamic, challenging, and keeps you hooked thanks to new mechanics like forms, summons, spells, and action commands . the variety of Disney worlds is remarkable, and their design faithfully captures the essence of each one ."
833.Spider-Man (2000),"The first great superhero game. is not perfect but is the first one where you feel like you are spiderman. Even insomniac’s games didn’t have this many villains, and despite it’s obvious visual age and clunky controls, this game has a charm to it not commonly found in modern titles.. The greatest Spider-Man game in all time in my humble opinion.. Spider-Man 2000 is a remarkable game that captivates players with its immersive mechanics, gripping storyline and rich comic book references. The fluid, acrobatic web-swinging mechanic provides an exhilarating sense of freedom as players traverse the beautifully recreated New York City. The game's narrative seamlessly blends iconic elements from Spider-Man's extensive comic history, immersing players in a vibrant world filled with familiar characters and stories. The attention to detail in the game's graphics and animations is commendable, faithfully capturing the essence of the beloved superhero. Spider-Man 2000 is a testament to the enduring appeal of the web-slinger, offering a truly immersive and thrilling gaming experience.. The game is good, but some of the bugs I've had, the awfulness of chapter four and the unnecessary difficulty of the final boss have reduced the score of this game. The third episode could have been longer, the first and second episodes were good, 4 was beyond awful, 5 and 6 were average. It's good that it's tied to the comics. My score: 10/7 It was made with google translate so it might be wrong.. ------------------------------------------------**** favorite game of all time.---------------------------------------------. Excellent game. good gameplay (there are few combos but it is controlled very well), and although it is quite short it is very fun and replayable.. I've had much fun with this game. The first level is really good. I still come back to this game every now and then.. As a kid I was playing this thing all over again. Great gameplay, interesting villains and it's all narrated by Stan Lee. What more you could want?. A classic Spidey game with loads of references to the comics. This is the perfect game for any fan of the webslinger. Tons of fights with tons of baddies in tons of locations. Whether you played this on kid mode or all the way to hard mode, this game is pure arachnid fun from opening to closing. Only big issue is the camera; which is expected since this was the very first 3D Spiderman game. 9 / 10. I remember playing this game as a kid a lot, like a **** ton of times on my ps2 and ps1, i love this game and i still do, despite it's janky-ish controls and monster ock in general.. First time getting to know spiderman because of this game, I was really happy as a child when I played this game, the game play and story were super fun, everything was perfect. An amazing and unique game that pays homage to Spider-Man comics! Exciting and extremely enjoyable gameplay with epic music!. Summer 2K was huge for generation 5 releases, it was the last big push before the next gen took over. This game was released among other giants but it never failed to shine. Amazing graphics, fun gameplay and amazing levels! This was as big of a deal in summer 2k as the most recent Spider Man game was last year. Decent controls for the time as well! Lots of action. Must have for any PS collector. One of the best for the console.. Great game but whats up with these gems of reviews like : ""undoubtedly the best spiders game with fantastic gameplay, 0/10"" or my favourite: ""10/10----------"" proceeding into giving it a 9/10 rating. Actual critique tho , with no weight on my final score of8.5 , mj is sooooo annoying. Undoubtedly the best spiderman game for its playability mode is continuous without pauses and has the best villains and lots of action!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. From the first time I tried this game, I had in mind an example of what the other Spider-Man video games should be like. Simply the best. Special mention for the voice actors that made it simply amazing. Just not only playing, YOU WILL LOVE IT.. i remember old day i playing spiderman on playstation one and i love that game. Great game!!! With Stan Lee as the narrator. The great comic book feel it is an awesome PlayStation game!!!. One of the best of PS1!!!!!!! I play this game since today, I remember when i was just a kid. The worst thing about this game is that it's extremely short. The rest of it is brilliant. For 2000, the game had nice gameplay. The coolest thing about this game is looking for secret comic books around the levels. Find the right amount and open new costumes - brilliant. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ""Spider-man, Spider-man, does whatever a spider can. Spins a web, any size, catches thieves, just like flies. Look oooooooouuuuuut......... here comes the Spider-man!!"". the most game played ever the most game completed ever i finished this game more than 70 times played since 2003 until now i love the battles in it ,especially the POLICE CHOPPER CHASE level and Spidey vs Mysterio level,its music are the best music ever used in a videogame epic game the game that made me love Spiderman character its games and its movies. This is a really awesome game, and does a great job of representing the web head himself in 3D. this is by far one of the best super hero games ever made, witty dialouge, excellent graphics, great game design, good music (including the original theme!) and a great inclusion of all spideys friends, and vilains. The game plays out its cutscenes like a comic book, which was also really cool to see, and theres lots of unlockables as well (like comic book covers), which keep the replayability high. The only downside, is that the controls are a bit sluggish. not only that, but there are also some instances of a bad camera, that come up fairly often. regardless however, if your a fan of spider man, or action games in general, then this is an easy recommendation.. I remember playing this at a friends house and even though I only played it for a little bit I remember instantly loving this game. Spider-Man is my favorite super hero of all time, and I really wanted to own this game, but not until recently did I finally buy a copy that I played on my PS3. The main reason I didn't buy this game for so long was because I wasn't sure age had been kind to it, but I'm glad to say that age has had almost no negative effects on it! The gameplay and controls are still great and the game is still a blast to play. Like any Spider-Man game, comic, or movie one of the coolest parts about this is the villains you get to fight, and you get to fight some of Spider-Man's coolest villains in awesome and challenging boss battles. The story is very well written, and expertly captures the feel of the comics. I couldn't help but smile when I heard Spider-Man toss out hilarious one liners just like in the comics, and interact with other famous Marvel super heroes. This game is awesome and if your a Spider-Man fan this is a must play, sure it could be longer and it's got some issues with the camera, but what old game doesn't? Not only is this the best Spider-Man game I've ever played, it's also super hero game I've ever played, and it's one of my favorite games of all time.. A game filled to the brim of non-stop action, web-swinging and wall crawling. One of the more striking points of the game is it's great plot and sound. Each level is fun and entertaining, making you not want to stop playing. This is accompanied with the voices which fits perfectly for each character. However, the game does suffer from clunky controls which can make it slightly frustrating at times. But overall with its close attention of detail to the Spider-Man universe and its awesome bonus costumes, this was a game needed to be created for not just Spider-Man fans, but for fans of the linear action genre as well.. I remember playing this game a long time ago, but I think I can honestly say in my opinion that this is the best Spiderman game I've played, and that includes beating out Spiderman 2 and Ultimate Spiderman which many consider as the best Spiderman games, which I agree with. This game was so cool though, I never was able to beat it though, because I ended up getting lost somewhere. This game haves the best Venom out of anything, especially better than the Spiderman 3 Venom.. The graphics are certainly dated at this point, but this game is still great. There are plenty of secrets and unlockables like costumes, game modes and comic covers to keep you going. The PlayStation version is the superior of the 5 versions of this game (DC, N64, PC, PS,GBC), so definitely pick it up.","despite its obvious visual age and clunky controls, this game has a charm to it not commonly found in modern titles . the game's narrative seamlessly blends iconic elements from Spider-Man's extensive comic history, immersing players in a vibrant world filled with familiar characters and stories . the game is good, but some of the bugs I've had have reduced the score of this game ."
835.Tenchu: Stealth Assassins,"I dont even remember in what situation i played this game, probably at some childhood friend house. I loved the style, but it was too hard to really try to beat it.. I think this game is one of the best ps1 game ever after Tenchu 2. I sad after because game is very dark also story telling is not so good but gameplay is very good. Stealth things are good, killing animations also very very good. I think this game series should be in the nex gen ps store library.. Tenchu is and always be one of the best masterpieces that I had the pleasure to play in my earlies gamer years, just 10 of 10 and the music is absolutely superb.. Normally I don't like games that require you to progress stealth. I thought it might be in this game. But no, they designed the game to suit every player. Progress by fighting if you want, or stealth. Of course, if you progress stealth, you get better points, it didn't matter to me. What matters is the enjoyment I get from the gameplay. Combat mechanics are very nice. You have to defend and attack in time. You have to be patient. You need to choose the direction of your attacks carefully. These kinds of things add dynamism to combat. Using various items is also very fun. It's a bit of a short game, but it's good enough. 1998's Sekiro :). I have had so much fun with this game series. I still come back to this game from time to time. The Japanese ninja samurai feeling is so good. It's a 10/10 stealth game.. The OG of stealth games. I don't even know what I could criticize about this game.. Absolutely amazing for its time, and it still holds up as one of the finest hack-and-slash stealth games.. This is a classic one.I loved everything about it.Starting from the various stealth kills, which were great.Also the combat was easy to get used to.I really loved the skill testing elements and i should mention the brilliant music in this game.. One of the few games that I would still recommend everyone to play today. Amazing soundtrack, brilliant story and awesome level design. A fantastic game.. A Masterpiece, loved everything about this game, it is definitely a must play!. Tenchu: Stealth Assassins is an amazing, well rounded stealth game for both the hardcore, or the casual gamer. The atmosphere of running through the shadows and stalking your enemies is always entertaining, whether you sprint through slicing every foe, or sneak by undetected towards the boss. Each level's reply-ability is astounding. And I haven't even gotten to the cheat codes yet. The blue screen dominated my childhood, as I'd give my character the ability to shoot bullets from his chest. All in all, this game is one of the best early 3D games, helping to define the stealth genre overall.. Flat shading, bad plot, bad controls and bad AI - it is how i would describe this game now. But since it was the first game in series and first 3D stealth game (also first serious, good stealth game) it can be called father of all stealth games. We can forgive these bad things since this game is really old and it was really good when it was released. True classic. Also it has amazing soundtrack. It is how legend was born, only to be destroyed after second game.. I remember this as a groundbreaking title back in it's day - one of the first to really push the stealth angle (you could generally only 100% a level by not being detected at all). The graphics were solid at best, but the gameplay and soundtrack more than made up for the visuals. I shudder to think the number of times that I must've played the level with the traitorous clan leader, just so that I could listen to the music again. And the fact that the ending was different if you played through as the male/female was just brilliant.. Nothing short of classic, Tenchu set the tone for stealth action games with rich atmosphere, insanely awesome ninja techniques, and simple, yet intricate gameplay that still holds up to this day. The music is also a staple in the game, much the same way Nobuo Uematsu's music is used in Final Fantasy. If you haven't played it, you're missin out.. Ground breaking game in its day, great control, wonderful soundtrack and voice acting , Great level design and story just the simple concept of enemies that didn't re spawn out of no where and stayed dead added realism that games today seem to miss.Classic. A true classic of the PS1, diverse selection of levels, ground breaking soundtrack great art style. Well worth dusting off and jamming in the disc tray","i think this game is one of the best ps1 game ever after Tenchu 2 . i loved the style, but it was too hard to really try to beat it . i think this game series should be in the nex gen ps store library."
836.Sonic Advance,"A fun return to form for the blue blur. Though the game has some iffy level design at times, its overall an fun experience. My major gripe with this game is how short it is, I took around ~40 minutes to finish the game without collecting the chaos emeralds which is very short for a GBA game. Overall very fun!. Okay, fine, I will admit, I liked this one. Elegantly transporting a close enough approximation of the classics and classic gameplay to a small screen, and making it work, unlike that horrendous GBA port of Sonic 1.. The Sonic Advance games are freaking great and fun. The first one is for me the best. The animation and the art style, the stages and the music are amazing. It is also fun that we have 4 characters to play this time. My only 2 complaint are the chaos emeralds and the special stages that even though they'll get worse in this series, in this game they are very frustrating. Also it suffers from a level design issue where it is almost impossible to be at least 5 seconds without something interrupting your speed or momentum, something that continued in the sequels. It is still a very fun game, very recommended. One of my favorite games of all time.. Emulates the Genesis classics and does so very well. Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy provide plenty of fun variety, challenges and repeatability. Visuals are fairly generic but get the job done. Not the fastest game in the series but this change is appropriate given the Game Boy Advance's limitations. Levels are designed elegantly though there are unfair traps from time to time especially in the last two levels. Bosses are good with the exception of the Egg X whose attack pattern and hitboxes are slightly unfair. Special Stages are the worst part of the game and all you get in return is the best boss in the game. Overall, better than Sonic 1.. Fair play to Sega for producing an all-new advance title rather than relying on a lazy port. Fast, colourful and containing all of the elements that made Sonic so popular on the Megadrive although for the faster sections it does feel a little like the game is playing itself. Younger players will love it though.. Even though this game is a good game and I would recommend it to a new player but I would not rate it a ten for many reasons but the biggest is death pits and traps. But aside from that its a good game. Sonic Advance is a good title that continues the classic Sonic gameplay from the original trilogy in a new 32 bit style with the modern designs. While not as good as those games due to the screen crunch and lack or ports. This game is still remembered by many as the true Sonic 4 and can be enjoyed by most as a good title.. Unpopular opinion: This game is literally garbage. Most of people will say this game is great for a nostalgic reason, but to be honest, this game is not a big deal. You can beat this game in less than 1 hour, also in order to get a good ending, you need to collect 7 crystals which it is really painful. Special levels are terrible, it's a horrible genesis pseudo 3-D stage. Stage levels are confusing and ugly. The good part of this game is the animation is good and the music are tolerable. If you want to play a good sonic, I recommend to play the Sonic Adventures 2, Sonic 1-3( genesis version) and Sonic Mania.. I really enjoy this game with the fun platforming like what the Classic Sonic Games have.. If any Sonic game fully exposes the series's pure creativity, it has to be this 2000s handheld gem.. This game is the definition of mediocre. There’s nothing in this game that stands out from the Genesis titles that came before it, and the screen crunch is so agonizing you’ll be making numerous blind jumps. This game is perfectly beatable in an afternoon, took me about 3 class periods to finish it up, and the autosave is nice because Egg Rocket will take plenty of your lives due to the faulty springboards that bounce you into unavoidable bottomless pits. One thing I didn’t really understand was the B button’s roll slide. It doesn’t add anything and I never used it as opposed to the spin dash. Overall the first half was definitely a lot stronger than the second half. The bosses were inventive and fun and there was a noticeable lack of **** in the first couple zones.. A straight-forward Classic Sonic remake. This one's not gonna shake the earth, but it's alot better than most of the other 2D titles. Check it out, you're likely gonna have a decent ride.. Sonic Advance is a good game, but it does have tend to have some rather questionable level design choices, including weird spike placement and enemy spawns. Otherwise, I would consider giving the Advance trilogy a try if you haven’t.. While it may not be a masterpiece, this game is still amazing in many ways. Not only can you play as Sonic and Tails, but Knuckles and Amy as well. And the levels are pretty good, as well. Hopefully everybody gets to enjoy this fantastic game, and they will have fun guaranteed.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the first 4 levels are good but when you face Angle island you will find Soo many bottom less pits it's unsafe to play as Knuckles there. but I like it to be like a classic Sonic game. the special stages are Trash it's just another half pipe level but now Sonic/Tails/Knuckles/Amy are falling with skateboards. I like the music one of my favs are Casino Paradise Act 1 and 2 and Neo green hill act 1. but I love the art of the characters it's like sonic Adventure. all tough Sonic Advance is a Good Game. Verdict: A great Sonic game on the go. I'd even say this is on the level of Sonic 2 & 3. Rating: Gameplay: 5/5 - Smooth and great. Level Design: 4/5 - Everything besides the last few levels is great. Soundtrack: 5/5 - Perfect Story: 4/5 - Nothing more than needed. This is great for on the go. Graphics: 5/5 - These sprites still get used today. Length: 5/5 - Perfect for 2D Sonic. Replay Value: 4/5 - Many different characters and emerald collecting. Enjoyment: 5/5 - Loved it Overall rating: 37/40 => 9.25/10 => 9/10. An exciting and thrilling game, this one! Pretty challenging, I only managed to win this game as Tails or Knuckles, never as Sonic or Amy. Sonic Advance Is 1 of my favorite gba games ever its so much fun and i think anybody should buy it graphics and sound is nice this is a mastepiece ****. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is one of the shortest in the franchise, and level design is one of the worst as well. But the addition to Somersault, Sliding and Backflip gameplay added a lot, in addition to having 4 playable characters with their own abilities, generating a lot of variety. The story is the same as the first game (that is, basically nonexistent).. Sonic Advance is fantastic! The gameplay is amazing and the level design is fantastic and just like the classics! This is definitely the best out of the trilogy. 10/10. That's was really innovative for the 2D Sonic franchises in 2000s, one of the best Sonic games I've ever played in entire life, Recommended! Pro: - Characters have their different abilities - Soundtrack is amazing - Levels are well-designed - Chaos Garden for who wants to chill after a difficulty day or stage Mixed: - The story is simple but amazing - One of four characters is harder to play. But if you know to play with this character, the game becomes easier Cons: Nothing XD. Modern Meets Classic Before Mario Did This Technique In 2006, Sonic Is The One Who Probably Inspired That.. Its Cool,its fast,its fun. One ofbthe best portabke Sonic Games. The only problem I had with the boses . Because they are moving. Sonic Advance is good. But, before I start this review, I don't get why people say this is similar to Sonic CD? It's not, it's similar to the classic games. It has the same physics and level design. So I consider this the real Sonic 4. It has great level design like its predecessors, the presentation is perfect for the Game Boy Advance, and the music is just too good. You can play as 4 characters, the obvious being Sonic, Tails and Knuckles, and the new playable character is Amy. She's an awful character to play as Jus... ju... just don't play as her. Each play style adds for a different experience and it will get challenging regardless of what character you'e playing as.. In my opinion the best in trilogy, very short, but fun game. I had zero problem with controls and level design seems okey to my tastes. Good graphics for gba and music its ok.. They brought back classic sonic and people still hate it? Sure the soundtrack isn't the best and has some flaws but the soundtrack got better in the 2 other games. The stages are original but still holding that classic sonic. Sonic Advance has more characters with unique powers! Sonic Advance is a fantastic game.. This is a really great game, and was a good way to start in the Sonic The Hedgehog series. It feels a lot like the original Sonic games, but with some modern stuff to it. This is honestly my favorite Sonic Advance game.. Sega went back to what actually works in a Sonic game, saw success, and then ran away from it again for some reason. Sonic Advance is a breath of fresh air in a Sonic series that did not do as well in a 3D space as the Mario games had, and brings Sonic back to where he belongs. Despite how good this game is it still suffers from what I would consider to be a cardinal sin in a Sonic game. PIT FALLS. This is a criticism of all three Sonic Advance games really because this is something you wouldn't find in the genesis games. You do not make Sonic run really fast and then throw him into a pit! That's not fair! You're pretty much forced to die at least once in the levels with pitfalls because you can't possibly see it coming the first time.. You spend the first few stages getting through pretty easily, and then BOOM you're falling to your death over and over again. If you're gonna put pitfalls in a Sonic game FINE, but you have to make them obvious! This isn't Mario! You're going fast so you shouldn't be thrown into pits over and over again!! It's maddening! Without the pitfalls the entire Advance series would be a 9 or a 10 for me, but the pitfalls seriously boil my blood and almost ruin the whole experience. I love that they went back to the old style, and I love that Knuckles is a normal character again (screw emerald hunting!) but the pitfalls.. THE PITFALLS!. Sonic Advance is everything Sonic the Hedgehog 4 should have been. High-paced yet precise sidescrolling. Physics that rival the original trilogy. Characters that provide new levels of fun. It's tragic that the Advance series as a whole has fallen into obscurity. The story is very much standard for the old-school 2D Sonic games. Eggman has captured a bunch of animals, and has decided to take over the world. Why? For plot convenience, of course. It's not the most interesting story, but it's a Sonic game, and gameplay takes priority. The gameplay is almost as if it was ripped from the genesis games themselves. The physics are pretty much perfect, and the level design is, for the most part, enjoyable. There are a few levels where trial and error are involved, but this is true of all 2D Sonic games. After playing it through once or twice, you'll know where to control your speed, and you will do absolutely fine. However, there is of course, a catch, as is tradition for Sonic games. The special stages are absolutely horrendous. They're slightly reminiscent of Sonic 2, which is fine in itself, but it involves a 3D plane, which really doesn't work well on the Gameboy Advance. It's incredibly difficult to determine where to place yourself, and as a result, makes collecting Chaos Emeralds tedious and frustrating. Fortunately, they're not necessary to enjoy the bulk of the game. The graphics are truly some of the best GBA games have to offer. Most of the environments are vivid, and the character animations are incredibly detailed. Sonic Team did an amazing job of the spriting. Even idle animations capture my attention, giving the characters a huge amount of personality. The game features four playable characters; Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and most interestingly, Amy. All play in a unique way, offering different paths and speeds. Sometimes these differences will benefit you, and at other times, you'll wish you picked another character. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles play as they did on the original Genesis games, albeit with a few extra moves, such as Tails' (useless) tail swipe, and Knuckles' (useless) punches. This game introduces Amy as a playable character for the first time in a 2D Sonic game. Amy is most certainly the most enjoyable character to play as- She offers a whole new level of depth to the game, requiring you to master your timing, as she lacks the ability to curl up. Instead, she can use her hammer to attack, which is actually advantageous in many situations. For example, she can jump higher using a special move, and has a longer range than Sonic's insta-shield. She can even defeat certain bosses easier than the other three, as her range far exceeds the others. It is a common complaint that Amy is ""not fun"" and ""too hard"", but to that, I say, unironically: Get good. These characters introduce a large amount of replay value, as well as fun, new ways to play. The sound of this game is, as always, very memorable. Sonic games almost never get this wrong. However, whilst the tracks are memorable and the sound effects are great, it definitely suffers due to the limitations of the GBA sound card. This doesn't stop them from being catchy and appealing, though. Overall, Sonic Advance is a brilliant game, and most certainly the best out of the trilogy. It keeps speed to a good pace, but isn't too fast, and also has 4 unique ways of playing. It's not without flaws, but it's still an extremely solid experience. I definitely enjoy them more than the Genesis games, myself... but that's a matter of opinion.. DarknessDude needs to shut up cause the level design is bomb and from my reading I can see he just **** at the game. I'm a master at it and this game is fun listen to the reviews 8 and higher.. This is an amazing game. I remember playing it back when I was 6. It takes what the older genesis games were about, and built more onto it. But, it has some cheap deaths here and there.. When I first played this game I was flabbergasted to see how amazing it was. The game has gorgeous graphics, nice set of characters,good music and it's 2-D. There are two complains one Sonic is not that fast and that Amy is useless but other than that this game is amazing I recommend it to anybody who has a game boy or Ds lite.. I find it weird how DIMPS could pull of classic Sonic style physics on the GBA with the Sonic Advance trilogy and on the Neo Geo Pocket Colour with Sonic Pocket Adventure, but can't get it right with Sonic 4, anyway. Sonic Advance is a fantastic game, and in my opinion, the real Sonic 4, it has classic Sonic style physics, multiple characters that play similarly with their own unique abilities, a fantastic soundtrack, great graphics, and overall fun gameplay, all of which, for the most part, Sonic 4 lacks. I recommend both Sonic Advance and Sonic Pocket Adventure if you have both a GBA and a Neo Geo Pocket Colour.. I've recently replayed through this game boy classic. It's still just as enjoyable now than it was before. With a more classic style, this Sonic game brings 2-D Sonic back on the Game Boy Advance. The levels are all enjoyable, but most not beyond the classics. There are also different characters (Tails, Amy, Knuckles), which allows you to tackle each zone in a different fashion, though most will just stick to Sonic. The zones are quite large, with the chaos emeralds being buried in obscure areas of the zone. If you want to see the games best ending, you'll find them all to unlock the Super Sonic Stage. The music is standard stuff for Sonic. There's nothing that's really as special as the classic games though in regards to music. Probably the most memorable part though is the first stage of the 6th zone, which was kind of a first for Sonic and hasn't been done in such a way again. Rather than trying to beat the zone as fast as possible, you're trying to beat the clock and it's a great challenge. The zone is massive and full of setbacks to make sure you don't make it, and it's one of my favorite Sonic zones of all time. None of the acts really excite me as much as this one does. The game is prone to Sonic's most annoying issues though with enemies that await while you're running, giving you no time to respond, and there are a few cheap traps thrown in, but otherwise, it's a standard 2-D Sonic experience with one zone in particular being one of my favorites.. Sonic Advance is the first game in the Sonic Advance series and, ironically, is for the most part better than the two sequels that followed it. The first Sonic Advance doesn't contain poorly implemented team gimmicks and brokenly convoluted level designs from Sonic Advanced 3, nor does it have the hurling a million miles an hour through bland empty levels filled with cheaply placed bottomless pits and obnoxious enemy placement from Sonic Advance 2. Sonic Advanced instead borrows from the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive Sonic trilogy game roots for inspiration. There is a nice balance between platforming segments and speedy segments in all of the levels, going out of your way to slow down and explore your surroundings is rewarded with new routes, unique springs that lead to Special Stages and various kinds of power-ups. the boss battles are very creative and are a decently difficult without feeling too cheap. There are multiple playable characters each with unique controls and abilities to make the experience playing with each character different. The level design is kind of both good and bad, although it does borrow amazing concepts from the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive Sonic trilogy, it kind of plays too safe for the most part leading to only very few truly new objects or concepts to explore, another problem is that the level design from the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive Sonic trilogy is designed for a larger screen resolution and when converted to the screen resolution of the Gameboy Advance, doesn't work as well as it could have unless you where able to see farther ahead of yourself and therefore more of your surroundings, it would make enemies and traps like spikes much easier to avoid due to more visibility giving the player more reaction time. The music is decent with both classic sonic music from the Genesis/Mega Drive games and music completely original to this game both coexisting, and doing a pretty decent job at it. For those that like other things to do, you have a Mini Chao Garden, Time Trials and a Multiplayer VS mode to mess around with. overall, the game is decent and a nice tribute to the classic games in the series of old from the early 1990s, it has it flaws, sure but it is a fun game that is easily superior to the absolute wrecks that where the two sequels, Sonic Advance 2 and Sonic Advance 3.. No platforming what so ever. THis game features four characters to play as and the only interesting one in Amy ****. Why is there no platforming. This game basically took everything cool about Sonic and took it away. Sonic Advance is a great title that places more focus on precision platforming and less focus on the speedier elements of Sonic's gameplay. It feels nicely old-school as a result and comes the closest to the original trilogy of the more recent 2D games. There are a few annoying faults that restrain it from true classic status, though. These would be the game's cruel placement of spikes (usually waiting at the end of an 'autopilot' ramp jump) and the way that the enemies always fire their projectiles either while they're off screen or as soon as they appear on it. Basically speaking, both those obstacles are neigh on impossible to avoid, ninja reflexes notwithstanding. The final boss also deserves a mention for being a huge disappointment, requiring more luck than skill. Sonic Advance is a great game in the franchise but it doesn't quite rank up there among the best.. Don't read any of the reviews here. Only trust reviews below 6 for this game. It's terrible for me. Why? I'll explain it to you. Sonic Advance is supposed to be basically what everyone calls ""itz awsme, lik Soonic CD"". I don't agree with any of that. This game is like an insult from Sega, telling everyone to screw off until next time. Why do I say this? Because the level design is terrible. The first two levels were enjoyable. But that's the issue, it's ONLY those two levels. While it makes sense that the later levels are supposed to get harder, it already loses my patience, reaching the ""maximum ragequit"" mode. You want a collection of hates? Here you go. First of all, the spikes. They. Are. EVERYWHERE YOU SEE. And plus, they place them at the rudest places ever. There's a spike where you are going to land. There's a spike where you are running. There's a spike where you are stopping at. There's a spike near your rings/items. There are so many freaking spikes, there is no way you can speedrun this game without dying at LEAST once. Another thing is the new enemy, the robot mole thing. It's exactly like spikes, except you can destroy it. And the level design has so many of these guys, like the spikes. I don't need to go through the same rant of how they are everywhere. And also, near the final levels, there is an overkill of enemy spawns. It's like the TMNT game for NES, where every house has hundreds of enemies on your screen. That's what the final levels do. What, are Sega the inventors of that game too? Are they trying to bring back ""classic"" frustration? Now let's get on with good things. You can become the awesome speedy guy that you saw in the older games. No, not those terrible older ones. I mean the classic Genesis ones. Those ones were fast. So is this game. That's a good thing, children! But the overkill of enemies of the levels just limit the speed, because you have to keep stopping, and then you go. The original Sonic games never wanted you to stop, you could keep going! Nope, not with Advance. And the extra moves for the characters don't help. Sonic has a roll attack thing like he does in Sonic Adventure. He also has an extra jump attack if you hit the A button twice. What help does an extra jump do? Oh, did you hear me again too? If you are a grammer person, that's right. MULTIBLE CHARACTERS. It was bad enough in Sonic Adventure. It was even worse in Sonic Adventure 2. Don't tell me you're gonna screw up classic Sonic with this. You have the following characters. Tails is basically the clone of Sonic, except it's a tiny bit slower but he can fly. Knuckles is an EXACT clone of Tails, and his punching moves don't help at all. Amy is useless, and the hammer doesn't help. Now the final two things I want to talk about are VS. mode and Tiny Chao Garden. VS. mode is the multi-player mode for this game, and it's fun. At least, if both players are equaly skilled. And the level design is terrible with all the stupid loops everywhere. What it is, explaining. You and a partner try to kill each other with loops and stupid power-ups. Done deal. The rings kind of take out the fun though. Tiny Chao Garden must be the main reason this game was created at all. To use it, you must BUY a GameCube and BUY Sonic Adventure 2 Battle. Then you BUY a GameCube-to-Gameboy Advance cable and get some Chaos and other stuff in the GameCube version. Connect the two games. Do something that I can't explain. You have your Chao in Sonic Advance. The thing is that you can basically raise him on the go on Gameboy, send him back on GameCube, and his upgrades are there. The thing is, the only way to raise him is get food, and the food is crazily expensive. And the two minigames have the most stupidest amounts of points you get when you win. Not worth the time. If you see this game, find it for a price of free, or at least $1 buck. Don't get this game at all on any of other price. The game is frustrating, stupid, and is NOT like Sonic CD at all. Don't even try calling it the masterpiece it was. Get the 2nd or 3rd, those two were so much better than this. Nope, don't even reach for this game because it has Tiny Chao Garden. Not for VS. mode either.. It's not ""groundbreaking"", but at least it sticks to its roots, resulting with one of Sonic's fastest adventures to date. Pros: Beautiful graphics; fast and fun gameplay at classic Sonic speed; excellent multiplayer; lots of characters. Cons: ""Hit-or-miss"" level design; nothing ""brand new"".. Even if it's a bit formulaic, Sonic Advance is one of the funnest Sonic titles since Sonic CD. Pros: Rich, colorful graphics; basic controls; it's fast, but easy to learn; fairly decent multi-player mode. Cons: Regardless of the control's will to run faster and never stop, a lot of the levels were designed to refrain you.. Let's see. Classic Physics? Check. Long, platforming-challenging levels? Check? Result. The closest thing to a classic Sonic game since Sonic 3&K. It has beautiful graphics and fluid gameplay. However, it does have problems that keep it from being perfect. There are a few moments where there are cheap bottomless pits. It's good to have four playable characters, but some of them don't do anything to improve the replay value of the game. I always use Tails to find the special stage springs, but that's pretty much it. Knuckles doesn't have walls or routes specified for him, and Amy is COMPLETELY WORTHLESS. Also, the special stages aren't anything special. Still, awesome game for awesome GBA fanatics.","a fun return to form for the blue blur . iffy level design at times, but overall a fun experience . a major gripe with this game is how short it is ."

838.Fallout 4,"I don't know if it has aged poorly, but this game is incredibly difficult to get into. While it initially seems interesting, following a mission order is impossible. The game doesn't distinguish between main and side quests. Many missions are above your current level, and the game doesn't provide any indication of this, leading to constant frustration and death. The Pip-Boy, or whatever it's called, is incredibly cumbersome to use and is essential for nearly every interaction. The weight limit is extremely restrictive, making inventory management a significant burden. Furthermore, the story fails to captivate from the outset, making it difficult to find motivation to continue playing.. cool fallout game, limited dialogue options - ok, but i play games to actually play the game, if i want to read i will read a book or play some stupid arpg.. Shooting mechanics were improved from 3, but they its RPG roots feel more striped down. Because of this, you'll basically shoot your way through almost every problem. The factions aren't interesting.. Worse story than past Fallout games, and although less buggy in general, some quests, such as The Molecular Level, are nearly unplayable. Overall still a great game with great plots and characters.. It's a great game with a not very good plot, but I advise everyone to play it.. Greatest game since the coming of jesus. This game is heavily underated and undervalued and many people do not know art from garbage.. Excellent game, immersive atmosphere, good storyline, settlement building is super simple and super fun, massive map and plenty to explore. No politics or agenda's (at least not blatantly exposed) and no funny stuff, just plain entertainment and fun! 10/10 in my books.. The story gets a lot of hate but I found it very compelling trying to find the truth behind the synths. Graphics and combat are the best in the series. This is my favorite Fallout game for sure.. best entry into the series. Has one major downside with that being the lack of true rpg mechanics, but overall the game runs fine and has pretty good gameplay, with a compelling story and great side quests. not to mention some of the best dlc's in gaming.. gameplay systems are interesting but not fleshed out, postgame is lacking. Story variety and art direction is good. Role playing mechanics feel weak, but the base building and trading was amazing.. Janky as **** the whole game is a bugfest and the cherry on top the graphics is trash this doesn't look like a game for ps4 rather a ps3 game.. It's my first Fallout. It's good, but repetitive. The missions are dull and most locations look the same (both interior and exterior). I wanna like it more because the setting and art design is great, but it became tedious after a while. The combat is ok, but not great. I ended up spending A LOT of time dealing with inventory management... and not in a fun way.. Fun but underwhelming game. Story has an interesting premise to begin with, however it quickly becomes lacklustre as the game went on. Crafting is fun and the skill tree is really intricate and diverse so you can invest points that suit your play style however the game's visuals are an eyesore. Companions are almost a necessity just how bleak, plain and empty the world looks and feels. Far Harbour is the more interesting of the DLC's. Good, self contained adventure with an interesting setting. Nuka Cola DLC is the complete opposite. Horrific quests, boring premise and very unlikeable characters, and annoying grindy trophies/achievements. The worst part is that this DLC practically forces you to be evil and have quests that bleed into and ultimately ruin relationships and settlements you've previously established in the Commonwealth. Just overall the DLC is a pain and is best left off to the end. It was nice to play this game with a steady framerate of 60fps that lasted for about 5 minutes. Constant stuttering, especially in denser areas. I'm aware this is an 8 year old game made on an even older game engine, but honestly the whole game is forgettable and undercooked at best.. 6.4/10. The atmosphere and setting of this game is amazing. It is absolutely full of amazing ideas and concepts but the execution of every single of them is mediocre at best. The story starts off good but loses itself very quickly when you start meeting and helping all these random people like as if you totally forgot that your kidnapped son even exists. The settlement building/management is a fantastic idea but it's super clunky and confusing thus making it not worth my time. The inventory/crafting system seems like it's very complex and well thought out, but it gets extremely confusing when the user interface is a buggy, jumbled mess. Worst of all, the combat is atrocious. When I get attacked by some creature and all I have is a dagger, it's completely immersion breaking and extremely frustrating when my character can only take 3 swings before he has to rest to build back up his stamina. If I try to run, I can only take like 10 steps before my character has to rest to build back up his stamina. If I have ammo, it's most valuable use is to buy me some time while I run away because enemies are so freaking durable. So much potential, bad execution.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While not quite as good as its predecessor, there is still plenty to enjoy here.. I rally like the gameplay: 9/10 Sorry i've to enter 75 charaters so... #^_^#^_^#. While not having the best story in the fallout franchise, Fallout 4 Easily has one of the best gameplay and gunplay of the Franchise but even so the repetitive quests And with one of Not so great stories in the franchise, it’s still a Let Down. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I love it. It is slightly less good than Fallout 3 and New Vegas in terms of role play, but the updated shooting mechanics combined with the fun settlement building system causes it to be very fun in other ways. I have played since launch (many characters) and have still never completed the main quest. It may be my 3rd favorite Fallout with some room for improvement, but that is still a pretty high bar.. spent 156 hours into the game. like all fallout main titles, another great game. not the best story every , but fans will understand. it is not the story you play fallout for.. it is the tenure.. best fallout game to date. no big waste-land full of nothing like FONV. no boring missions and charters like FO3.iets field to the brim with explorasion, every building you can enter and has loot and a story. charters are lintrusting and have a Mission if you get them to trust you.. Fallout 4 is a downgrade in everything compared to their previous games, good and significant part that there is a large community of modders to fill these holes that have never been filled or improved by Bethesda and even so I expected much more from Fallout 4 since the year it came out in 2015 where we had games where Fallout 4 seemed to have come out 5 years before 2015 and not in 2015. ... visually the game for me as a fan is a downgrade compared to the concept and look of Fallout 3, the gameplay has also suffered from this with the removal of some game mechanics that you only find in FO3 and Fallout New Vegas. FO3 and FONW had many features that made them great. All decisions affected the story, its ending, and all the characters you encountered along the way. However, Fallout 4 left a huge gap in terms of its ending. No matter which organization you choose, you don't feel like it affected anything in the world, nor do you feel that your actions made things better or worse. In dialogues, I find several inconsistencies with the ""player,"" something that should be improved to make the game more immersive. This is what Fallout needs to be rated a 7 or even an 8. It needs to focus on immersion, dialogue, HUD, visuals, and even gameplay, and improve significantly. Despite its rocky launch, Fallout 76 has made significant improvements compared to Fallout 4. I'm not talking about visuals, as the difference isn't much, but in terms of gameplay and mechanics, they are excellent. I highly recommend Fallout 76.. Now I haven’t even finished the game yet but this game is just so much fun and relaxing in a way I originally got it on the Xbox One and it ran pretty smoothly besides the loading screens took a while but when I added it to my Xbox Series X it ran even better this is one of Bethesdas best. The Game is very good for 2014 but has almost the same amount of bugs a ciberpunk and also it's very difficult in in very easy mode but also the variety of weapons and the giant map helps make this game a Solid 6 not the best game but it's inst unplayable. At the start i was generally pretty hyped to get to play my first fallout game. I lasted for 3,5h in total before i quit. The mechanics aren't very well explained, and if you aren't a fallout veteran you won't really get into the game. At least when i got bombarded with Nukes my experience was ruined. Also the graphics are pretty horrable. Even for 2015. In total i wouldn't recommend for casual players!. very fun game i absolutely love it. a bit linear tho which is the only terrible thing about it. It’s an amazing game with amazing graphics and combat the storytelling is amazing and the single player experience is perfect for this type of game I believe fallout 76 was trash for multiplayer and no single player. A lot of bugs, same mission all over, dumb characters, but, still one of my favorite games, the ps4 slim (next gen update) is worst than the original version, i couldnt finish some missions.. Gave it a couple hours and just hated it. The storyline and missions were just all over the place to begin with very little guidance on what to do. Combine that with the fact that you run into enemies that you have to shoot a million times and can kill you almost instantly and it just wasn't enjoyable. Rather, I found it boring and frustrating. I guess it's good for some people but not casual gamers IMHO. Plus, I found the graphics rather simple too considering when this game came out.. The story part was interesting, at first. However, as in the open world games it become inconsistent and therefore it loses its attention. The gameplay, customizations were fun. But, I would say that nothing memorable. If I like to play shooting I would go to COD, Cyberpunk or TLOU. I did not get the atmosphere of this open world. Every time when I had opportunity to fast-travel I used it. The side quests from Preston were not fun. However, much of them were just go, find it or kill it, then go back. However, some side quests are really gems of the game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. People hating on this game only because it lacks a bit of RPG characteristics are blinded. This is a masterpiece.. This game is a good example why you should play before reading review. Lots mediocre reviews could put people off but to me I think this game is brilliantly put together. There may be times where you have to reboot because it crashed but you can quick save anytime so it’s never affected me majorly. I completed this back when it was on PS4 and returning to it in 2024 on my second play thru is completely different to before. This is due to the freedom of choice when playing. You can literally head of in any direction from the start and decide who to make friends with and it affects how to story turns out. The size of the map is huge with so much content and the world itself has tons of interiors and underground sections that add to the size. So a map like GTA is about the same size but there’s these large pockets of emptiness whereas in FO4 the detail is much greater. Plus being on foot means you can’t drive to get from A to B so the sense of scale is better interpreted. If you like a game that encourages you to explore and discover how great it is get this game. If you prefer games that hold your hand the whole way through then maybe you should play something else. I can’t talk about every aspect of the game or I’ll be here forever but there’s so much content. You can upgrade weapons and armor, build settlements and even these little optional activities can have you glued to the screen for ages.. It’s easier to write the things I didn’t like about the game because I liked the majority of it. Early on I didn’t realize that ammo would be so scarce at times, so I decided to dump all the minigun ammo into the deathclaw encounter early on in the game, and throughout my playthrough I struggled at times to get enough ammunition to keep playing. This kinda gets sorted though through perks that make ammo more abundant and just by generally looting enemies and POI’s. I also feel that combat could be better, at times I would be just standing still in my power armour shooting at a giant lobster or something, tanking all the hits, because it was a little easier, but the problem might be that I wasn’t playing too well. Overall, the combat does add incentive to trying out other weapons through different ammo types, meaning once u have used up all of a specific ammo type, u go and try another weapon, or if the one ur using isn’t great then u can try something else. Also I found that often it would be easy to keep looting and end up carrying too much stuff and not being able to fast travel when encumbered meant I couldn’t dump it all at my base and then set out again, although this can be fixed with a perk. The story wasn’t amazing and lots of dialogue choices feel useless at times. I wish there was a faction reputation or loyalty system, but hopefully that’ll be in Fallout 5. Game is worth playing overall!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Being my first game in the series, nostalgia goes hard on this one. However, when I push past that, it definitely has troubles. Sure, I find the story compelling, as my brain will take anything slightly good and call it a masterpiece, but I know people who were left dissatisfied. The graphics are okay, it is a 2015 game after all, but Bethesda could've done a bit more with the Next-Gen Update. On the topic of that, this update blew out the entire modding community, which really ****, making half of my mods useless. The performance and bugs are hard to come by. (The only problem I've had with it was when I launched like 50 nukes with the nuke minigun LOL) Overall, a great game with a great story, make sure you pick it up if you haven't already.. Constant issues with the aspect ratio getting messed up whenever I accidentally hit the windows key. Stopped playing when V.A.T.S started glitching out. I love fallout but I'm sick of jumping through endless hoops to get it to function properly.. I recently buyed fallout and ive been enjoying it so far. The game (even on normal) has very fair difficulty and fights. V.A.T.S works perfectly and bullet physics are also great. Storyline isnt even that much boring which is honestly surprising. Graphics (played on ultra) are not perfect but also not ""deafult"". I would say id rate them 7/10. The climate and 80's aesthetic really satisfies me and spills honey on my eyes. Not much to say about the skill tree and its not pretty big so -1 point. Loved the terminals mechanic and picklocking is pretty fair. Dialouge options pretty nice even tho not all say that. Long list of quests, armors, weapons and locations so thats really cool. Face mimics are classic bethesda (didnt deduct a point). Nice encounters and pretty big and open map. Cool and enjoyable quests and i love the settelment building mechanics. The game has one big mistake - loadimg screens. I dont know if its me or fallout but my loading screens are very very long and it can be extremly annoying. I once waited two whole minutes to exit the building that ive accidentaly entered which is weird and a definite problem. I deduct a point from that. Overall pretty good game. Very good game even now in 2024, I play on PC. You just need to check for some good mods.. The gunplay solid, The story while not as good as fallout three or new Vegas is still solid,The voice acting is top-notch,And the world is lush and very fun to explore. Unfortunately, at least in my experience this game has a crashing problem. I’m 42 hours in and the game crashed on me seven times. For comparison, I’ve played Elden ring, Horizon forbidden west,And borderlands 3 For longer stretches of time and all of those games crashed on me three times combined. If this game was still $60, I would definitely say wait for a Price drop Because there is fun to be had Just be aware of some bugs and glitches. Next Gen or Not, its one of the best open world lives out there. yeah, i meant it right. it aint just a game. its more than that. the story is okay, the visuals are livable and Cait, yeah cait likes everything illegal. 1- Might be a bit boring in the beginning, but its kool when you catch the strings 2- All genres loves have something for them in this massive wasteland, 3- There are many moments where you take your steps carefully so that you dont pee yourself. and thats awesome.. I decided to give a second chance to the game and realized that this game pisses me off a lot of times, but I still like parts of it, it has bugs, some people might need glitches to have fun and the settlement building elements are terrible most of the time, but, I love the post apocalyptic setting of the game, the V.A.T.S. gameplay is fun and the story and characters are lovable, still,It was not enought for me to give a good score.. Yeah i know bethesda simplified the game for the wider audience but honestly i don't care. game's strengths were good (companions and side quests). primary story was horrible though. Fallout 4 is a good game, and I’ve spent hundreds of hours playing it since the original PS4 launch. However, this upgrade is extremely lackluster, which warrants downgrading the score a bit. For one, this took way, way too long. Presumably, they just waited until the time was “right”, meaning when they could predict the most hype and sales, which surrounds the TV series debut. The graphics are only slightly better than the PS4 Pro, while still being locked into 30fps in “graphics” mode. There are still NUMEROUS bugs, and new regressions. This was not a thoughtful fan pleaser or labor of love, but your average cash grab. Still, it’s far better than nothing, and the PS4 version had become unplayable on PS5 thanks to no 60fps support. If you have never played, absolutely do and you’ll love it. I’ve just already been there, done that, and this doesn’t add anything good enough to make me want to play through again. If it had come, hmm, two or three years ago like it should have, maybe I’d feel different, but it’s a day late and a dollar short.. Fallout 4 is an immersive and engaging experience set in the post-apocalyptic world of the series. The vastness of the open world, enriched with details and secrets to discover, captures attention from the start. Character customization, weapon crafting, and settlement building provide a unique sense of freedom. However, the main storyline may lose some intensity in favor of numerous side quests. Nevertheless, the moral choices and consequences of your actions make each playthrough unique. Ultimately, Fallout 4 is a must-play for RPG enthusiasts and fans of post-apocalyptic universes, despite having a few minor flaws.. the gunplay is nice, and the world is dense and filled with stuff to do. unfortunately, all of that stuff to do is very repetitive, shallow, and has very boring and pointless writing. the player is given little to no choice in what happens, the dialogue perks are a shell of their former selves which serve only to earn you an unsubstantial amount of caps or experience without influencing anything in the plot. i've uninstalled this game at around 50-60 hours because despite it having immense potential as an open world shooter and rpg, the writing, quests, and many of the buildings or vaults are just not interesting enough to explore when your reward is just more boring dialogue, and the guns/settlement system might have a ton of depth but they feel like a pointless investment when there's so little of interest actually going on and your character's disposition is flat and banal regardless of what choices you pick. people said that the far harbor dlc was better and that the writing had more depth to it, but i found it to basically be the same as the rest of the game. apparently, the rest of the dlc is pretty bad as well.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Despite its flaws, this game remains unmatched in its genre, far superior to titles like Starfield.. The highly awaited fifth installment of the franchise did not disappoint ! All clad in Bethesda DNA, Fallout 4 offers a new take on the franchise with a more dynamic yet still fallout-paced RPG. Amazing environment work, great references to the other games, consistent lore additions, impacting choices and new franchise directions (new Power Armors, crafting mechanics, settlement building...) make the game complete and playable over and over. The attention to details as well as interesting DLCs make for a convincing and really enjoyable Fallout game.. Love this game. Can't believe I let the haters discourage me from playing it. Sure, I ran into some bugs and locations are missing maps which can be frustrating. Other than it's a great game.. Yeah.. no. U just can't count the mods into the rate. Since Fallout 2 the vanillas are just broken, half the job is done by the modders community. The game is huge but awfully designed and balanced. Barely playable without mods. For xp, encumberance, ammo etc. Ruins a bit the experience but well, far less than playing the broken vanilla. A lot of junk to pick up but too few useful items, not enough xp (u need about lvl100 to get the useful perks and make it fun, but i was 2/3 into the game by lvl 20 before mods), the weight limit makes u go back to the base every dozen steps, full of minor bugs, bases building is lame and boring etc. Max grade with mods. Blessed be the modders.. One of the very few games that i finished twice, and the game is huge.Everything about it is phenomenal. Next gen update make game more modern. If you are new to Fallout games, this is a good time to play this game.. I tried giving Fallout 4 a shot after the show came out, and in the initial onset, I found the game to be enjoyable. Gunplay took a moment to get used to, as I'm not used to FPS games, but I managed to get adjusted to it. And the start of the game was actually pretty interesting. But the moment you get plopped into the open world after leaving the Fallout shelter, the game took an immediate nosedive into boredom. The writing was so boring, the combat encounters boiled down to VAT, pray to the RNG gods that it hits, and if it misses, have dull cover shooting while you reload. Graphically, I found some early PS4 games to look way better than Fallout 4. Aside from Cogsworth, all the characters you meet in the first couple of hours are so boring. I don't want to join the Minutemen, I just want to explore and hopefully find something worthwhile to do. The 4 hours I spent playing this game gave me enough of an impression to get this game off my console ASAP. Serviceable enough gunplay can't overcome a game designed to be a terrible time waster. Even though it's free on PS Plus, don't play it. My experience is purely revolved around the PS4 version, so I can't comment on the Next Gen ""Updated Version"", but if what people are saying is true, I dodged a bullet there.. piece of **** greedy bethesda, going back on their promise of free upgrade for next gen / PS5 but making sure the update breaks existing mods that are not monetized (so they get a cut) bethesda games are buggy, broken or just using horrible game design choices - its not ""quirky"" or ""takes a while to get used to"", they're just bad and the long time fans are starting to get tired of **** like this if microsoft doesnt manage to fire whoever is in charge or green-lighting all the bad choices at bethesda, starfield might be their last ""successful"" game. Creation club doesn't even work. Just says ""Operation can't be completed"" and boots me to the title screen. Decided to give some of the stuff from the creation club a go after watching the tv series, and I can confidently say that between this and Starfield I won't ever be buying anything from bethesda again.. My favorite game of all time. You can spend hours and hours in this world, and a lot of the more annoying things from the older games get cleaned up, like the map most noticeably for me.. After getting this game, Literally haven't played any other games. This game is so good. Get the game.. One of my favorite games! I really don't know why so much **** about this title! Fallout 4 rocks!!. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME It's an insane world Bethesda has come up with. I believe it's a must play to believe on how lost you can get in this game. I got the G.O.T.Y. version. It's great...your making decisions and everything counts. I love being the star of an apocalyptic movie.. This was truly the game I've always came back to year in and year out. I was absolutely in love with the branching story, leveling system, & overall gameplay. Did I want Preston Garvey removed from the game the entire time? Sure, but it didn't take away from my desire to scavenge everywhere on this map. For both story & gameplay, I think this is a knock out of the park. The only thing that keeps it from a 10 for me is the tedious or menial tasks that you occasionally have to do. These are minor when related to the rest of the game and I recommend anybody pick up this title to experience it just once.. This abomination does not even start new game in 2024. Trash product from a trash company.. Fallout 4 is a vapid waste of time. Boring, meandering open world with a story so dull I could fall asleep. Where the combat lacks in impact and coherency, it makes up for it by being... slow? I'm sorry, I'm struggling to find positives for the combat if I'm being honest; for the game in general, even. Fallout 4 is a blight on your wallet. Play Skyrim or New Vegas, then you might garner some enjoyment out of an infinitely better Bethesda product. It's decent not perfect It keeps crashing regularly on ps4 And bugs. It's not a bad game That's it. As of January, 2024, Fallout 4 is still Bethesda’s last great game. I’m starting to think the glory days of Oblivion, Fallout 3, New Vegas, Skyrim and Fallout 4 are over. a good story, good combat, amazing building and, while there aren’t as many interesting locations as Fallout 3, it still has great locations. I don’t get the hate for this game. I think peolple have just become spoiled and entitled.. A solid contender for the worst best game. Most of its rating points come from it being the only next gen offline fallout game.. Impressive like fallout 3 and Oblivion, exquisite narrative, which is the engine that moves the whole game and makes it a thrilling experience. As we have seen in fallout 76, they have left aside scripted adventures and in favor of the on-line game and bethesda has plagued it with low sales and the loss of trust of their audience, I hope that in elder s 6 they do not make the same mistake or create procedural and unscripted side quests, as in skyrim. Yes, the combat mechanics can be janky, but this is overshadowed by how fun it is to blow stuff up in slow motion VATS or persuade people to lay down their guns and give you their money using your 10 charisma. Just an amazing game with loads of things to do and ways to play.. Fallout 4 is ones of the games that I felt aged really well. I remember when I played it back in 2015, I was as well under the general public's impression that this was an OK game. Good, but with its clear drawbacks of simplifying the ""RPG-Fallout"" formula. However, when coming back to it in 2023, I started to appreciate it at its full potential. And after just a brief comparison with Starfield (which is a piece of garbage) , I acknowledged the good parts: Gameplay. Simply fun, combat it's definitely the best in the series, guns feel good and gunshots are weighty enough for a game which isn't a native shooter. The world is massive and immersive, and fun to explore. The skill tree & RPG elements are its weak point, but again, the game still manages to be fun. Story & World Building. The story, while not groundbreaking, works fine. Its weakest point is actually not a story-related one, but the interaction between gameplay & story & immersion. The game fails to transmit the urgency of finding Shaun while you are able to stop and complete any side-quest before this, but I easily overcame this by concentrating on the main story until mid-game. Then, after (spoiler) finding Shaun, you can continue playing it like a true Bethesda game, immersing yourself in the world and in its side activities. Immersion. The best thing that kept me going throughout the game's story & world is the voiced protagonist. Again, unpopular opinion, but both the voice actors of Nate and Nora did a tremendous job considering how many thousands lines of dialogue are in this game. It helped a lot to the immersion, on the contrary of what people say. Also, the world of Fallout is CHARISMATIC (again, compare it with the blandness of Starfield). The retrofuturistic 50s atmosphere, the nationalist American themes, the conspiracy theories, the funny robots, the magazines, Vault-Tec artworks (applying to the skill tree & VATS), it's a perfect escape from reality. And speaking of escapism and coming to maybe the most controversial part of my review: the complete lack of wokeness. Fallout 4 was made to be a good and fun game, it doesn't follow any ""forced-diversity"" rules and does not try to establish an agenda (looking at you Starfield, yet again). If the themes that helped people survive the apocalypse in the world of Fallout are family (male, female and child), loving your nation and anti-communist fight, the game isn't afraid to show them! Because it has nothing to fear, as it doesn't offend anyone. The diversity & inclusivity that it has, it's done right.. First negative emotions Fallout 4 managed to deliver before it even started properly - the Intro spits into your face that "" US ended World War II by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki"" (quote) . while Fallout Universe represents some alternative history of our world - that statement **** onto not only any History. alternative or not, but common sense of any normal human-being and humanity in general. So the game didn`t even start, but already brought strong feeling to stop it there and then. Gave it a chance, though: as expected, Bethesda **** on any Fallout lore - its horrible Fallout game. If to forget you playing Bethesda pseudo-fallout, game is vast as ocean and shallow as piss puddle: it attempts to make steps into so many directions, but at the end, reaches none. not all ideas were bad initially - but being bethesda-made, simply died off by their implementations - pre-war scene - actually cool idea, but could be done SOoo much better, settlement building - sort of strange for a game where a LONE Wanderer is main theme, yet it could work, if only after building your town you didn`t get generic, boring settlers who you can`t communicate with in any interesting way and who looks like came of some line production of dolls with rubber skin, and so on, etc, etc. Never I've played a game that I hated to love and loved to hate this much. Everything you've heard is true, from the dumbed-down mechanics to the awful story with all its nonsensical plot twists, I really do feel like I don't really have to point out every issue here, all FO4's problems are self apparent and have been talked to death already, what I'll","many missions are above your current level, and the game doesn't distinguish between main and side quests . the story fails to captivate from the outset, making it difficult to find motivation to continue playing . shooting mechanics were improved from 3, but they its RPG roots feel more striped down ."
839.Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time,"Great story, decent humor, the best clank sections in the entire series, the ship exploration is kinda cool. Incredible game. My favorite in the series.. Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time is an exceptional entry in the Ratchet & Clank series, showcasing some of the franchise's best qualities. The game effortlessly combines exciting action, platforming, and a deeply emotional story, creating a thrilling and unforgettable experience. Incredible Visual Design The game's visuals are nothing short of stunning. A Crack in Time boasts vibrant, richly detailed environments, from lush alien jungles to sprawling futuristic cities. Each world feels distinct, with a high level of polish and artistry that immerses players in its colorful, dynamic settings. The animation is smooth, and the character models, especially Ratchet and Clank, are incredibly expressive, enhancing the emotional impact of the game. Refined, Dynamic Gameplay Gameplay is a core strength of A Crack in Time. The combat remains fast and engaging, with a huge variety of weapons and gadgets, each with a unique playstyle. The addition of time-based mechanics, where players control time using Clank, brings new layers to both combat and puzzles, adding depth to the game. These mechanics are brilliantly integrated, providing clever and creative ways to tackle challenges. Engaging Story & Character Development The emotional depth of A Crack in Time elevates it above many other platformers. The relationship between Ratchet and Clank is at the heart of the story, offering a heartfelt narrative that explores themes of identity, destiny, and friendship. New characters, especially the time-based mechanic Clank's storyline, enrich the plot and provide an engaging counterpoint to Ratchet's journey. The dialogue is witty and fun, keeping the tone light even as the story delves into more emotional territory. Outstanding Sound Design & Music The soundtrack enhances every moment, whether during action-packed sequences or quieter, more introspective moments. The music dynamically shifts to complement the fast-paced combat and emotionally charged story beats. The sound design, including voice acting, is excellent, with characters brought to life through expressive performances. Perfect Balance of Innovation and Familiarity A Crack in Time strikes a perfect balance between introducing fresh, innovative mechanics (like time manipulation) and staying true to the series' core gameplay elements. It's a masterclass in game design, offering creative challenges and keeping the player engaged throughout the adventure. In conclusion, Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time is an absolute triumph. It combines thrilling action, creative puzzles, emotional storytelling, and stunning visuals to create a game that is simply a joy to play. Its seamless integration of gameplay mechanics, fantastic world-building, and memorable characters makes it a standout title in the Ratchet & Clank series, deserving of all the praise it has received.. Much like Tools Of Destruction, the game is all about destroying everything possible whilst exploring different planets. The characters are even more goofy than the first and the story is a bit more developed than the first. However, it still doesn't feel fully realized and feels too simplistic. That's a huge criticism as a good story is required for replayability. This is fun but definitely forgettable. Still, you won't be disappointed tho.. This is probably my favorite Ratchet and Clank game in the series. I love Dr. Nefarious as the villain. 90-93%. A Crack in Time follows on from the first R&C Future Game Tools of Destruction story having gameplay elements that evolves the franchise. You may want to read up on Quest for Booty to fill in a plot hole between the two major games. The first major change is the space piloting. It is done in an open world setting where you can land on mini planets to complete challenges rewarding you upgrades. This was a huge upgrade from ToD even making the spaceship more manageable. This is a good idea as it makes the whole R&C playable areas far more interactive. The main 'gimmick weapons' to traverse the stages have changed showing real innovation of the franchise. However, there was less focus on platforming and removed gliding, but added hover boots to increase mobility and speed in the larger levels. There are slightly fewer levels but they larger giving more depth to each world. The levels using Clank have been greatly expanded upon with more engaging puzzles which was a nice welcome. The graphics took a small yet noticeable upgrade once again which felt like playing a low budget Pixar short film in the 2000's. I really enjoyed the game but slightly prefer ToD. It could be the charm but also likely due to upgrade system in weapons and weapon variety as A Crack in Time I felt the weapons, although diverse, were limited in how practical they can be. Both are amazing games and worth 20 hours of your time.. A Crack in Time is ultimately what the Ratchet and Clank series has led up to. It combines everything that made Ratchet and Clank right, and adds space exploration and time solving puzzles to help improve on what was already a great formula into something even better. The music is perhaps the best its ever been, the game looks wonderful, the characters will still have you laughing, and it can even be a bit emotional. A Crack in Time is truly the defining experience for the Ratchet and Clank series. It took me quite a bit to beat this game, but I overall had a Blast with A Crack in Time. The gameplay was great and diverse. From Clank, to Ratchet, to even traversing the depths of space. There were many puzzles and challenges that kept you going and kept you tested, and of course the many weapons within your arsenal. Truly a great game.. The best ratchet game on ps3. A perfect way to end the future story of R&C. A veryz emotional and impressive story makes AciT probably the best game in the series.. ""Ratchet and Clank: A Crack in Time was the first ps3 ratchet and clank game I had ever played and it was exhilarating, carrying on from where clank and ratchet are separated, they go through perilous quests to come in contact with each other again. While in the mean time the classic villain Dr nefarious from the older games makes a return and is more wretched than **** gave a sense of relief that an older character to maintain his relevance in the ratchet and clank story. The decision to separate Clank and Ratchet seemed off, disrupting the dynamic I love between them like when they would always give funny quips to each other. The Clank puzzles unfortunately became a tedious aspect, lacking innovation and becoming repetitive over time. On the positive side, the weapon customization feature added a refreshing layer to gameplay, allowing for a more tailored experience. I was relieved to find that the game retained the tournaments and other elements that harkened back to the older games, living up to the franchise's reputation for action-packed fun."". This game is very enjoyable, even when getting the platinum. The story is basic, but they tell it nicely for a video game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.].

One of the best ratchet and clank games ever made and wow this pushes the hardware on the ps3 sometimes even more than into the nexux does. Everything is good, except the temporable displacment puzzles for clank and the terribly design space ship boss battles. Plus i missed the more zoomed in 3rd person camera from Tools of destruction. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A Crack in Time remains, arguably, the best entry into the Ratchet and Clank franchise for good reason.. Best RaC i have ever played, amazing villains and storyline, despite ratchet not being with clank till end of adventure he does not lack of mobility at all,also has the best clank levels on the franchise. Awesome Game! Would be foolish not to try it. Epic Storyline and a blast to play. This was a really frustrating game for me. I have read many great things about the Ratchet and Clank series and how funny it is, with this particular game being one of the best and funniest, so I jumped in to it and did not see what the fuss is about at all. The story and jokes really felt like it was made for the under 10 years old players-complete with over animated movements and cutesy characters. I will usually get a few chuckles out of a Pixar movie or Saturday morning cartoons, but this was flat as a pancake for me. Not to say that kids humor can't be funny to adults, but it felt like they were trying so hard. Another thing this series is lauded for are the weapons-which were also disappointing. I only really felt like one or two guns did any damage and half the guns are just for crowd control of some kind or another. Add that on top of an auto aiming system that is really finnicky and you'll get real frustrated, real fast. And speaking of frustrating-the platforming was really rough for me. Way too often I would miss a jump for seemingly no reason, then die instantly, then restart at a checkpoint from way back in the level. It was a real exercise in patience to complete the game at all. If you like the series, you probably don't need my opinion and more power to you, but if you're like me and thinking of giving it a chance, probably just skip it.. Another masterpiece from ""Future"" saga. Now this is game, which must be rated only 10/10.. I am a big fan of Tools of Destruction, but I was very disappointed with Quest for Beauty. Now that Rift Apart is on the pipeline, I have decided to return to the series and I was very pleased with A Crack in Time. A Crack in Time has everything a Ratchet & Clank game has to offer. Explosions, fun weapons, humor, gorgeous graphics and cinematics. You mostly play as Clank in the puzzle parts of the game and as Clank in action parts. Also, this may be the largest Ratchet & Clank game ever made. It has dozens of planets, which you can travel anytime with your spaceship and during your travels the game will become a space shooter. Even if the space combat section of the game does not feel very deep, it still brings a distinct flavor. I loved the soundtrack, especially the jazz. It has a wide range of tracks and the music suit well the rhythm of the game. The main problem with A Crack in Time is the story. Although the game never takes itself seriously and it would be unfair to expect a deep story from a Ratchet & Clank game, I’ve found the story of the Tools of Destruction more cohesive. Also, hard difficulty can be too hard in your first playthrough at times, so I would suggest playing on normal difficulty on your first game and maybe switch to harder difficulties when you unlock many weapons. I played on hard mostly, but switch the normal when things got too frustrating. I did not beat the optional final boss Vorselon which requires some grinding, but I may consider doing that in the future. All in all, Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time is a great game. It’s easily one of my favorite platformers ever, up there with Tools of Destruction. It takes as long as you want it to take and offers non-stop entertainment.. A litle to much clank gameplay even if its one of the better versions of clanks gameplay. The game is not the best ratchet game but it is still a 10 but super close to fall down to a 9. Children's live game, with a cool open world, an arena for gladiators (I love), upgrades, and good enemies. A good game, but sadly what was already a kids series was dumbed down even further then the original. All the funny critiques at consumerism are gone, the story is fairly lazy, so is the animation.. Gameplay: 9.5/10 Story : 10/10 Sounds : 9.5/10 Graphics : 9.9/10 Best ratchet and clank game. This game offers great playing experience as Ratchet and Clank franchise usually deliver, especially the time recording clones puzzles are quite impressive.. this game is literally PERFECT,the arsenal is great, the free world is good, the free world in space is sublime,planets are impressive, same for the story,the final was so moving,this game is great as up your arsenal. Undoubtebly the best game in the entire saga. The visuals are amazing, and so are the weapons (the addition of Constructo weapons brings a layer of customizability). the gameplay is without equal (R&C-wise), as the hoverboots are a blast to use. Clank sections, although being slow and repetitive, are quite enjoyable as the puzzles aren't too complicated or long to solve. The story also is quite deep. But the masterpiece resides in its brand new space navigation system. In past games you had to watch a cutscene of Ratchet flying in space before landing on a planet, in this one, you fly where you want by yourself. Indeed, you can cruise though a few different sectors, each containing one or two planets and a handful of moons to explore completely. But also side quests and jobs for NPCs to complete, enemy satellites and ships to destroy, all which can be done listening to four radio stations (classical, electro, jazz and rock) THERE'S LITERALLY 4 HOURS OF RECORDINGS FOR GOD'S GOOD NAME tl;dr play it. This is a BEST game of series ever!! This is how to make Ratchet games! Guys, if you don't have a PS3, please buy!. Spanish: Juego muy bueno. El mejor Ratchet de la saga. Gran cantidad de armas, muy variadas y con resultados impresionantes. La historia engancha. Puedes pasear con la nave en el espacio al ser un mundo abierto y completar mini misiones para mejorar la nave. 9.3/10 English: Very good game. The best Ratchet of the saga. Large number of weapons, very varied and with impressive results. The story attract. You can walk with the spacecraft in space as it is an open world and complete mini missions to upgrade the spacecraft. 93/100. An absolute masterpiece! This is probably my favourite R&C of all time. Just go play it. Now.. I really liked the Clank Parts in this Game. It's a good game but i just can't play it for so long as the other good Ratchet and Clank Games.. I enjoyed it it was better than the others and the gameplay was not crazy hard like tools of destruction I would give it a Light recommendation. The best storyline in the whole series and the best end, gameplay is also great. The graphics are incredible and clank puzzles are quite enjoyable only one problem with this game is that the ships levels are quite boring.. Probably the best Ratchet and Clank game in the whole series. Finallly, a clank section that I actually like! The one thing I do have to knock it down for that the weapon upgrade sytem was unbalanced. All through the game it was pretty even, then you get to one level and your weapons start upgrading crazy fast! like I was able to upgrade to 4 or 5 weapon levels in that area. Other than that, This game rocks!. An in amazing story and also puzzles makes me wanted to play ratchet and clank forever. Fantastic GAME!!! A WAYYYYYYY better game... than literally any game: after and before, Into the Nexus. Ratchet and Clank Future: A Crack in Time is unique in terms of narrative structure and it’s one of the prettiest games that Insomniac has still managed to pull off.. Literal god tier ratchet and clank game, this game is 10/2 years old (at the time of writing this) and it’s aged like fine wine. Best gadgets, best weapons best story, best side characters, best villain, meh side villain. But most importantly Best Gameplay! Do your self a favor, fan or not pick this game up you won’t regret it. Its a amazing game for me its one of the best games of ratchet and clank good graphics and history. For newcomers it will be great, but I was kind of disappointed by it. Game takes Clank from you and really doesn't offer anything that would be on par with him. Levels are made with new hoverboots in mind and that means more space with less stuff in it. There is some kind of bloom everywhere and it looks pretty bad. On top of that, Ratchet goes for a more serious story that really is the last thing a game like this needs. At least Clank levels have some clever puzzles and I love those little asteroids in space that you can land on.. 8.5 out of 10 - Amazing game. Scoring Scale: 1 - (AWFUL) Among the worst games ever made. The developer should be ashamed. 2 - (VERY BAD) These games are so bad they're insulting. 3 - (BAD) Just bad. Game suffers from a wealth of problems in all areas, very few redeeming qualities. 4 - (MEDIOCRE) A game that has its fair share of serious problems with a few glimmers of quality sprinkled throughout. More than anything it's forgettable. 5 - (OKAY) For every positive this game has there is just as many negatives. You may be able to find enjoyment in these games however you will likely be met with equal amounts frustration and disappointment. 6 - (GOOD) There is a decent amount of fun to be had in these games albeit with a few noticeable drawbacks. Worth checking out at some point especially if on sale. 7 - (GREAT) A game that has some flaws but all in all is a great game worth every penny of its purchase price. 8 - (AMAZING) Game of the year contender only allowing for some minor flaws. 9 - (SUPERB) One of if not the best game released that year, truly special. 10 - (NEAR PERFECT) One of the best games ever made.. A suprisingly good and funny story that falls short in only minor ways. 93/100. The best Ratchet and Clank game by far: a new 3d map of the Galaxy, new tools and weapons, the return of Insomniac museum.... My first entry into the Rachet & Clank series and I absolutely loved it. This is a game that brings u back to the nostalgia of Jak and Dexter gameplay, yet brings everything up to speed years later. I thoroughly enjoyed this game. It makes me want to go back and relive my childhood with some of the games that started me gaming. Think insomniac games for this gem and showing us why your still number 1.. I personally prefer Tools of Destruction over this game, but this game definitely has stunning visuals for it's time and super addicting gameplay that you can play for hours upon hours. However, the best part about this game is the story; it's super intriguing and entertaining. The best story in the series so far.. This is the most pleased Ratchet and Clank game on ps3 and maybe ps2 with the level of graphics they put on for the ps3 and the very long well-written story with challenges, combat, and bosses. One of the best games on ps3 and hope soon they make a new future game on ps4 :). This game surpassed what I thought would be great, I didn't think anything could beat the Legendary 10/10 Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando, but I was wrong. Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time is a masterpiece (not Master Chief) from Insomniac Games. The Visuals still look like they could have come from a PS4, or 5. The Story is amazing, and truthfully sometimes emotional. The Story follows *spoilers* Ratchet as he's trying to find his Robotic companion and Best friend Clank, who is trapped at the Great Clock by Dr. Nefarious, along the way Ratchet meets another Lombax named Alister Azimuth, who teams up with Ratchet not only to save Clank, but also for his own redemption. The Clank challenges, are great, the open Galactic Space Travel was brilliant, and the hoverboots, are fun. This game is excellent, and if you have s PS3, and you do not have A Crack in Time, get it Right now My final Score for this masterpiece is a ... 10/10!!!! Amazing!!!! This game is for kids, and Adults alike, I love it.. My favourote ps3 game. this is a masterpiece of a platformer and probably the best in the franchise along side up your arsenal. Do your self a favour and play this game, you won`t regret it.. Very entertaining, as always; Ratchet and Clank never disappoints. The storyline was rather interesting, and the variety of weapons and situations is as nice as always. This was a great beginning on PS3 for the franchise.. The mighty lombax and his trusty mechanical partner are back YET AGAIN for another crazy space adventure. This one continuing where it left off from the previous entry. To me, I felt like this game has run itself through the same gameplay over and over again. Blow **** up and well collect bolt. Sure the new gameplay elements are cool and the jokes are still funny enough to get a giggle out of them. But I think I've just had my fill of those damn Clank controlled portions. (Which need a serious upgrade!!) As always, the weapons are bigger and badder than before; but Insonmiac needs to go back to drawing board and breath some life back into the games! In all honesty, there is some seriously great potential to be had with R&C. Maybe one day we will see it reach that! As for my experience, I got bored with this one. Maybe I'm just burnt out on the whole series.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I love this game. It nails everything it tries to do. The graphics are maybe not the best on the ps3. But the planet design is awesome. The weapons are creative and each one feels different. The plot is one of the best in the series and the characters are awesome too. This may sound stupid, but i think it's the best game on the ps3 and it's one of the most underrated games of all time.. The timeless, classic Ratchet and Clank gameplay you know and love wrapped up neatly with new additions such as space exploration, side missions, space combat, and in-depth time manipulation puzzles with clank that are complex, but fair. It is superbly designed with all the typical ratchet and clank humour, a beautiful presentation, and an extremely satisfying ending. Easily recommendable and well worth a playthrough.. I enjoyed this game, it was ok, the time travel and clank gameplay was something new ive enjoyed, the graphics are impressive just like tools of destruction. A Crack in Time is the most ambitious and colourful Ratchet and Clank game in the franchise. The game takes many risks, and it excels in final product. The ability to control your ship and fly to a vast array of mini-planets whilst also exploring the main worlds with a much less linear style works perfectly. The splitting up of Ratchet and Clank themselves allows for a gripping story that further develops Clank especially.. Probably my least favorite Ratchet & Clank game. I don't approve of the new gameplay mechanics. The story is alright and not nearly as good as in the earlier games. The bosses are boring to be honest. Only the last boss was mildly entertaining. The weapons in this game are not as good as they were. They are all more or less the same with their shotgun range. They just look different from each other. The puzzles were not good either. They weren't hard, but just time consuming. The Clank missions almost bore me to death. Not really a fan of this one.. Ah something other than a FPS. Amazing. Glad I played this one on PSNow. Great game, childish but fun and a total breath of fresh air even though it was out way before, to the current look at my weapon and watch me destroy you. Challenging and great. Loved it **** just happy with it.. Mediocre game, too unfocused. Tries to be funny but fails badly at the end. Stay away from these pretentious piece of crap. Boring, tedious and doesn't worth your time.. Ratchet and Clank is a beloved series on the PS2 and PS3 and the Future games are totally awesome. My daughter and I love the series! It's not coop but you can still enjoy it together.. An amazing game, and an perfect example of what a game should all be about. Yes, this would be my first ratchet and clank game, and needless to say I will be buying future/past iterations of this franchise without hesitation, This game has everything I look for in video games, the fun factor, variety in gameplay, decent-good story with fun platforming, puzzles, addictive side-content, perfect gamelength, and a game that doesn't take itself too seriously with added in humor. There wasn't much negatives in this game, although I felt like the story(especially the ending was pretty predictable), wanted more platforming/wacky unique guns, since it can get repetitive shooting so many enemies in the game. But clearly the positives outweigh the negatives by a mile; this is probably a better investment than most triple a games coming out this past year or generation in my opinion.. One of the best in the series so far. The new Clank gameplay is a great addition, and the balancing issues from Tools of Destruction have been fixed. A good part of the series storyline too. A little short.. Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time (known as Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time in most PAL countries) is a 2009 platformer video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. It is the sequel to Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction and Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty.. Action game for adults and kids alike. Epic in scope and in game mechanics. Focuses on action (third person cover-based shooter) and not so much on exploration or puzzles. The puzzles are innovative (though I once played a Flash game with the same gimmick), but that part of the game only feels added on like a bonus. It doesn't really take off as it only gets an hour or two of shorter puzzles mixed in between the main story. The action, however gets plenty of time to expand from simple blasting to a balancing act with a big arsenal of memorable weapons. The story aims for the ridiculous and hits it hard, spot on. Not anything to teach you life-lessons or anything. But you do come away from the game feeling a little bit more capable, a little bit more heroic.. RC A Crack In Time is one of the best PS3 games i have played. The story is great, beautiful graphics, cool music and awesome gameplay. You will love the weapons, most of the planets, the sidequests, and riding around the galaxies while listening to the Pirate Radio or the Deep Space Jams!. This game is awesome, anything you want to see in a R&C game is here; awesome platforming, smooth game play, precise controls, good graphics, the crazy weapons that Insomniac implemented and a beautiful story, the mechanics are relatively fresh with time travel that somewhat reminds me of Chrono Trigger where there are multiple ""gates"" scattered around and time manipulation, also the Clank sections of the game are really enjoyable, the cut scenes are serious but have that bit of humour in them, you know, just like every Ratchet game. Collecting Zonis is great fun, and it reminds me of Zelda's pieces of heart; Collect 3 Zonis to add a new upgrade to your ship. The final verdict is; go get this game, you'll enjoy it thoroughly.. One of the best things Insomniac did. A Crack in Time does everything right with no mistakes whatsoever. The only people who won't like this game are the haters and fans who have gotten sick of the formula. +Story +Fun Shooting +Constant Rewards +Challenge Mode. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Ratchet and Clank Future: A Crack in Time is not just the best Ratchet and Clank game ever made, but it is also the best platformer ever made! It's funny, exciting and full of heart. It stays true to the Ratchet and Clank series while improving it. This game has the heart of Pixar and the comedy of Dreamworks while still bringing an exhilaratingly fun traditional game that has tons of replay value despite its long length (if your trying to complete everything that is). All of the cool new quarky weapons brings new excitement to the series, and the customizable weapons is also great upgrade.. The game is enjoyable all the way through and still adds many new gameplay elements to keep it fresh. Do not think that you are crazy for playing this game through more than once; I and many others most certainly have.. ratchet and clank a crack in time is probably one of the best ratchet and clank games together with up your arsenal this game is just so good the graphics are better more and cooler weapons many extra's and great gameplay and character development another great extra for this game is the insomniac museum what is quite big too in short ratchet and clank a crack in time is probably the biggest ratchet and clank game ever made this is what ratchet and clank shoud be again. +better weapons +good character development +big open universe +great gadjets. This is the best game that I have ever played. It is all I ever wanted in a video game. Its gameplay is really good, even the Clank stages which I disliked in the other games, the story is great and unique, the graphics and design is just so beautiful, and the soundtrack is amazing. This game doesn't let me down.. A Crack in Time stands to be one of the greatest Ratchet & Clank adventures to date, taking everything that made Tools of Destruction great and expanding on it. The addition of explorable space, as well as reinforcing the platformer elements with time puzzles and additional collectables make this title a fine addition to glowing franchise, and one of the most highly recommended titles to play in the series.. I have always loved the Ratchet & Clank series and this doesn't disappoint in terms of the experience. This probably has the best story of any game in the series revealing more about Ratchet and Clank's respective origins and what happened to the Lombaxes. The other characters are great to with Azimuth being my favourite. The wepons are as fun as ever and the same great platforming and shooting is there from the other games. The changes such as now being able to freely pilot your ship and Clanks's time puzzles are good to. It changes up the gameplay well unlike All 4 One. The graphics are great to with alien worlds and varying environments looking better than ever. Truly a great game. As of writing this, I have finished the story but haven't collected all the Zoni (I think I have like 3 left to collect). The story is right on the boundary between good and awesome. It is fun to play, but it didn't blow me away like it did with Uncharted 3. Same with gameplay. There are a few parts that I really dislike in terms of mapping/locations or whatever you want to call it. The moons where you collect Zoni and mods sometimes get really annoying. But otherwise, fun game.. Simply fantastic game. Seems like the game series are never going to die away. Beautiful graphics, epic storyline and gameplay make this easily one of the best action/adventure games what ps3 has to offer.. Literally the only game on the PS3 that is flawless. Stunning graphics, exceptional storyline, beautiful gameplay, and great dialogue. One of the best values considering how long the game itself is. Entirely worth the purchase; I play it all the time.. You didn't know your PS3 could do so much. ""Ratchet and Clank Future: A Crack In Time"" is the final installment in the ""Ratchet and Clank Future"" trilogy, and the final ""Ratchet and Clank"" game to follow the original format (Yes there ARE new R&C games, but these are simply because R&C are Sony's main mascots and naturally star in other games with different concepts, just like how Super Mario still stars in MarioKart). This game has it all; an incredible, gripping plot, a massive variety of weaponry (customizable and upgradable) and a very long l",Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time is an exceptional entry in the series . the emotional depth of the game elevates it above many other platformers . the game's visuals are nothing short of stunning .
84.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic,"Better than any of the Star Wars movies or shows, and required playing for any gamer, even if they hate Star Wars.. KotoR is one of the best Bioware products ever created. Star Wars lends its universe well to the RPG format, with a highly engaging story and incredible gameplay.. A clunky masterpiece that delivers everything Star Wars should. Oh, and, Revan.. Very good game overall. It still holds up incredible well in 2024. But where is the remake they promised?. The single best Star wars game ever created, and one of the best games of all time. The story is a masterclass in storytelling which rivals ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Its a must play for any star wars fan.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I’ve tried playing this game 3 times now on three different platforms and I just can’t do it. I’m a big Star Wars fan and that’s not even enough to keep me interested. It’s so slow and uninteresting I have no idea why people took the time to beat it, even back in the day. The combat is so simple and tedious even for an RPG. The characters are flat and typical. The choice system is all right but not as good as a Lot of other games. The only reason to play this game in 2024 is if you’re replaying it. But there is no reason to get into it now when games like Jedi: Survivor exist.. Perfect Star Wars game. The story was mindblowing and it was great embracing the dark side.. So perfect! This game only needs a remaster not a remake, but whatever I just hope they respect the essence of this game: the D&D gameplay.. One of the best Star Wars games ever made. Tons of great stories and characters throughout. Lots of different styles of combat you can try out and builds to explore. Well worth playing through multiple times to experience both the good and evil paths. (Originally played on Xbox, replayed on PC). This is trully must play game so why are you still here? Go and give it a try. My personal favorite Star Wars game of all time. The voice acting and dialogue trees are top notch. I wish they would release this on newer consoles. Specifically, the PS5.. The best Star Wars game thatever existed till this day. Interesting story and characters, beautiful planets and just peak BioWare.. It is a good old game which can be modded to look good for todays standards. Although it is not the masterpiece als it is often praised in my opinion - still it sparked some kind of star wars interest in me to continue with other games from the series which is not a small thing by any means for me.. Awesome game masterpiece from BioWare a long experience if you are looking for everything the game has to offer. Easily my favorite. The music - the characters - the story; everything lines up.. Released in 2003, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) on the Xbox captured the hearts of Star Wars fans and RPG enthusiasts alike. Developed by BioWare, this iconic title took players on an epic journey through a galaxy far, far away, delivering an unforgettable gaming experience. One of the defining aspects of KOTOR on the Xbox is its immersive storytelling. Set thousands of years before the events of the Star Wars films, the game delves into the conflict between Jedi and Sith, offering players a chance to shape their destiny. The narrative is rich and compelling, filled with memorable characters, surprising plot twists, and moral dilemmas that keep you engaged from start to finish. The graphics, while not cutting-edge by today's standards, were impressive for its time on the Xbox. The environments are beautifully crafted, showcasing a variety of planets and locations, each with its distinct atmosphere and inhabitants. From the bustling cityscape of Taris to the ancient ruins of Dantooine, the game brings the Star Wars universe to life in an immersive and visually pleasing manner. In terms of gameplay, KOTOR offered a seamless blend of real-time and turn-based combat. The strategic battles allowed players to pause the action, plan their moves, and execute them with precision. As you progressed, your character's abilities and powers expanded, allowing for a satisfying sense of growth and customization. Whether you chose to follow the path of the Jedi or embrace the dark side as a Sith, the game provided ample opportunities to shape your character's skills and alignment. The Xbox controller, with its intuitive button layout, made KOTOR a joy to play on the console. Navigating menus, issuing commands, and engaging in lightsaber duels felt smooth and responsive. The controls were well-adapted for the console, ensuring an enjoyable and immersive experience without any major frustrations. The sound design deserves special mention, as KOTOR's soundtrack and voice acting added depth and immersion to the game. The iconic Star Wars score, combined with the talented voice cast, brought the characters and the universe to life. From the menacing voice of Darth Malak to the wise guidance of Jedi masters, the audio elements elevated the overall experience and added to the game's authenticity. Despite its age, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic on the Xbox remains a standout title in the RPG genre. Its compelling narrative, immersive world, and engaging gameplay continue to captivate players, even years after its release. If you own an Xbox and are a fan of Star Wars or RPGs, KOTOR is an absolute must-play, allowing you to embark on an epic adventure in a galaxy far, far away. May the Force guide you as you explore the mysteries of the Old Republic on your trusty Xbox console.. One of my favorites games. Great RPG sytem, great story and great combat. This is the best Star Wars game by far.. One of the all time great RPGs. Story is gripping with some interesting characters and dynamics. Every world you visit is well realized and feels unique, with good amounts of content. The main downside is that the into area, Taris, quickly outstays its welcome and drags on too long. After Taris the game is brilliant.. The gameplay is pretty bad. Its interesting how CRPGs really havent aged well in gameplay. The RPG elements aren't great either. The story and universe are good, but I'd wager if this didn't have star wars attached to it, no one would really care.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If FF7 is the king of JR-PG's then KOTOR is the king of western RPGs. I cannot explain in words just how amazing this game is. The story, the characters, the customization, and build options. The game is so big and so full and it's so easy to get drawn in. If you haven't played this I highly recommend picking it up on steam. it's fairly inexpensive and is usually on sale a few times a year. There are even mods to make the experience better.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Not only is this game one of the best Star Wars games ever made, but also one of the best video games ever made! I've obsessively played this game since it released and have beaten it dozens and dozens of times. Every year I make sure to beat it at least once now. It just does everything right. The music, story, characters, and locations are incredible. The gameplay is also really fun, though over time I have noticed it's flaws, but it is a 2003 game so it can be excused. I highly recommend this game.. Bioware nail what they’re good at which are deep RPG world and character building games, with an in-depth view in the story. If you like star wars, play this. If you like Mass effect, play this.. This game is a masterpiece. Brilliant storytelling, characters, music and environments. Usually I don't like the type of combat this game has but it works really well here. There aren't even that many flaws I can think of. Definitely in my top 10 games of all time list.. I'm a big gamer and star wars fan so when I played this game back in 2003 i was blown away by the graphics and story. I see a lot of people complaining about the combat and bugs. And my answer to that is if you're some kind of **** or this is your first time playing a video game I reccomend you to play ""cool cat in the house"" where you can learn to press the A button without needing any help. But for real the combat is strategic and thought based if you don't like that go play Call of Duty or some **** that doesn't require the rest of your brain. And when you boot up a game from 2003 you should really know what you're getting into. But the main part that kept me playing was the god tier story and the companions. Being a star wars fan in 2003 I adored the jedi and the sith and star wars in general so when I heard that this game was set 4000 years before that I was skeptical. But when I popped it into my Xbox and played it I saw that I was wrong. The story was so immersive and detailed. The worlds were intricate and beautiful and the companions were loyal and funny and just so goddamn likeable. If you haven't played this game go do it's $10 on xbox so bye.. This game is solid, it's fun, you should play it. It's not amazing and earthshaking, it won't change your life... but you'll have fun.. Possibly the best RPG game that exist today without a doubt, it has it all when it comes to a good RPG system, im also very suprised that for once a RPG game can offer a great story, and maybe the best you can get into this genre. Of course, there are some moments where you can get stuck, since the game dosent tell you exacly what to do sometimes to progress a story or a side quest. The game can also be extremely tedious if you play it more than 4 hours every day, so it's a good tip to follow. Overall a great game and very enjoyable for those who loves RPG. If I where fan of this genre, I would give it a strait 10.. The best Star Wars game out there in my opinion. The story is so good. And the voice actors for this game are incredible.. Everything about this game is perfect. The exploration, combat, story, universe, and dialouge is nailed to atee. If you have an xbox, PC, 360, or ONE, you MUST play this game.. Astonishing. The greatest star wars game ever. And one of the best RPGs ever. Story 10/10 Setting 10/10 Gameplay 10/10 Replay-ability 10/10 Music/Sounds 10/10. This is without a doubt the best STAR WARS game of all time. Ill keep it short... It is a absolute masterclass in the RPG genre and a true adventure for any STAR WARS fan. if you have not played this game do yourself a favour and play it now. It is backwards compatible with all XBOX ONE consoles and on PC and IOS/Android.. Kotor holds up pretty well with a star wars story still better then any of the Disney films have managed to make. But that's really where the game shines in story telling and characters. While there are a lot of little nitpicks i could make the worst part of the game is the turret sections it forces you to do at random when going from planet to **** ya great game just play it if you like star wars.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A great RPG for anyone. I have two gripes, but I guess that is because of modern RPGs. One is no (so far, as I have yet to fully complete the game) re-playable side quests, or at least on some which you can fail. 2nd is the graphics could have better, like Halo, but I'll let slide. The game has a diverse set of things to do like card games, trading, and RPG action. There is also a force meter, telling you how your choices affiliate with both sides of the force. The character development is great, and the story will keep you guessing.. Even 15 years later, I can't say I've played a better RPG than Kotor. It's contemporary Morrowind comes incredibly close, and many other RPGs are definitely engaging, but Kotor just did it all the best. The gameplay, the score, the writing, the worldbuilding, the decision-making. A deep, rewarding RPG that still warrants replays to this day.. This game is the best star wars game and one of the greatest games of its time. It's got a combat system that you will never find in today's video games. The game included great characters, an Amazing story and a plot twist that will be remembered forever!. If you want to play a true Star Wars RPG game, this one is it and it's only for the original Xbox so get the Xbox console and get this game if you want to live up such glory.. My favorite game of all time, played it almost every year since 2006 and it still hasn't gotten old!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Tier 1 + A classic RPG that gets nearly everything right in story progression and branching narrative + Expands on the Star Wars universe in ways more compelling than any of the films managed + An eclectic range of quests, companions, and RPG progression rewards - Combat is fairly tedious, though standard fair for an RPG of its age. One of My all time favorites, played through multiple times, can still play through and have a blast 12 years later, instant classic few games like it. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a fantastic RPG. Star Wars is one of my most favourite franchises ever so being an RPG lover and a Star Wars lover, I had to play this game. The story is pretty great with you being light side or dark side and your path chooses the outcome of the endgame. The story has you traveling to different planets with their own unique atmosphere, people, and creatures so there's lots to explore and it gets to be quite adventurous. The quests are good and exciting, the characters are great that have very good dialogue and the AI is pretty good too. The leveling system is decent with you having to choose different powers ranging from ""Force Push"" to ""Saber Throw"" to ""Force Lightning"", there are a lot of options. My favourite RPGs are the ones where there pretty much nonlinear but this game is a lot more linear. I feel like that you just roll along to each planet one by one and when you're done with the main quest and side quests there's nothing else to do. I want to be able to keep revisiting places that have activities or something going on all the time. One little tiny complaint I have is that the robes you find throughout the galaxies don't really look like robes. If I want to play like a jedi, I want to look like a jedi. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is an amazing RPG that will please anyone, and it's a must play.. This is definetly the best star wars game I have ever played in my entire life. It always brought joy to me, up until the time that my Xbox stopped working.. This is BioWare at the peak of its finest storytelling, as epic as the Mass Effect trilogy has been recently. Knights of the Old Republic was the first truly revolutionary Star Wars game to do any more than catch a few minds or attract a few stares. KotOR now has a cult following even today, ten years later, and there have been cries for a better second installment and even for a third for the past seven years at least. The role-playing elements offer up plenty of choices, the only detracting factor being that your major, main playable character cannot be any species other than human, male or female. This is, however, easily remedied by the fact that you can switch between party members at any given time on the fly, and experience the strength of a wookie or the wiles of multiple jedi. Few things go wrong throughout the gameplay, save from a few minor glitches here and there, and slightly longer than average loading times in order to load the enormous world around you. The environments are rich and fairly detailed, the action and stealth mechanics are solid, the controls well oiled and tried and tested, and the story excellently crafted. This first Knights of the Old Republic game is certainly ambitious to the finest point, and for good reason as it is an epic success and in my honest opinion, BioWare's finest work until Mass Effect 2.. a true masterpiece, an excellent and immersive rpg that best star wars game ever made and one of the best rpgs ever, the story is as god as if not better then the movies, full o side quests, unique environments, plot twists, well developed characters and replay value that is very high. Great Game!. Set 4,000 years before the first Star Wars film with the Galaxy still recovering from the recent conflict with the Dark Lords, the ongoing battle between the Jedi and the Sith rages on. Knights of the Old Republic is an action orientated RPG that very much pathed the way for the Mass Effect games. With character development at the forefront it was one of the first console games in which your actions really affected the outcome of the story. Fortunately that story was exceptional, particularly by video game standards, playing a large part in making the game a success. Featuring a twist to rival the best Hollywood movie Knights of the Old Republic really is the real deal.. To date one of the best RPG's I have ever played, the mechanic of choosing to go down a light side and dark side with consequences on your chosen path to the story was amazing to me, especially with the change in how your character looks. The game has brilliantly fleshed out characters, each of them interesting. The combat system is probably one of it's most positive aspects, combat felt challenging if played on the right difficulty yet not frustrating. One of the best story twists that I have ever witnessed in a video-game. A must-play if you are a Star Wars fan.. Tied as my favorite game of the previous generation of consoles, this game was awesome on so many levels. The characters were incredible, the story was awesome, and graphics and environments that made you feel like you were in the Star Wars universe. I was not a huge Star Wars fan until I played this game. I have beaten it probably half a dozen times.. A general view on gaming nowadays is that new means better, but sometimes the classics can be much more entertaining than the newer games. This is the case with KOTOR, which brilliantly combines the spectacular world of Star Wars with an inventive and utterly addictive game mechanic. Add cleverly created characters, a plot to rival the original movies stunning graphics relative to its period of release to that combination and out comes my favorite game of all time, KOTOR.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Arguably my favorite game of all time (I'll admit, the Star Wars part does help). Don't mistake this as fanboy of Star Wars, but it did help the game having an established background. That being said it is very independent from the plots of the movies, and has an awesome plot with a great twist. Compelling narritive, great alien races, HK-47, Great crew, Good combat, Awesome Jedi powers, and a good moral choice system (as in if you're dark side, dark side force powers, which are more powerful, cost less, but people don't like you). I could go on gushing, but I am bored, just if you have never played this game, do so! It's awesome.. Not every video game is innovative to death but fortunately an epic game that breaks the limits eventually comes. This is the case of this game, despite of it's age i have played through this game about ten times and i still keep playing it and my experience is always different in some way. You can notice how much love and effort was put in the making of this masterpiece, nothing can stop this game. The story is one of the best I have seen in a very long time and has many side-stories related to characters and a lot into it. The graphics are not really the best but the environments are huge and varied and they look amazing. The sound is the best, nothing beats the music and voice acting in this game. Overall, this is the best game I have played (ever) and many people can share my opinion about the game, it deserves every single award it has won and it deserves an HD remake, I have faith in you Bioware, keep it up.. Easily the best Star Wars game ever made, This game is as close to perfection as you can get. Its an amazing RPG that gives you countless of hours of fun, I have replayed it countless times just to see the difference in the story (you have Light Side and Dark Side choices in the game that effect the game in many ways). The only problem is that its features quite a few annoying bugs and glitches.. A true classic with a story that rivals any of the Star Wars movies. Makes you truly feel like a Jedi Knight. George Lucas please do the me and the world a favor and make this game in to a movie.. Gripping story, memorable characters, innovative D20 combat system, tons of customization, infinite replay value, and the sweet, sweet satisfaction of succumbing to the lure of the dark side make this game the number 1 Star Wars game ever made, and one of the best XBOX games ever.. Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic not only delivers an amazing Star Wars story and an excellent RPG but does both in superb fashion. Featuring an epic story filled with memorable characters, and perfectly balanced and simplistically good gameplay, KotOR is one of the best and most complete games ever made.. A fantastic game. Enormous and yet personal, a truly epic game. Playing it 8 years after its initial release, although the graphics are out of date, I still feel myself awe-struck at the incredibly deep and engaging story. In my opinion, a greater story, and more engaging characters than the movies.. Amazing RPG. Great story and character development. Immersive and original storyline. The turn based combat system is surprisingly seamless, gives you the time you need to switch between abilities and spells and then gets you right back in the action. Game is very open to play the way you want to play, whether you want to be a valiant and honorable Jedi, or a ruthless Sith, the game really lets you decide.. If ever there was a perfect RPG, it would be this one. Big worlds, lots of character development, engaging story, great dialogue system, long storyline as well as plenty of side missions, memorable characters (I still can remember all of your party members, their voices, and their back stories), awesome ending, and plenty more. If you are even remotely interested in Star Wars or in sci-fi in general, this is an absolute must play game. You will likely spend hours and hours playing and replaying the game. I, personally, have played a total of 80 hours and still I want to keep coming back even 4 years after beating it. It is amazing.. Bioware is one of my favorite game developers, RPGs are one of my favorite game genres of all time, and I love Star Wars, so this was a game that I had to find, and I'm glad I did, the story is fantastic, and a lot of the characters are great, but it does it have it's flaws, it has some really weird bugs and glitches, some of which made it where I couldn't finish some quests, the combat system could have used work, but because it's an old game I can deal with it, and that it rarely feel like a Star Wars game, it has it's moments later on in the game, but for the most part all you will get are some sound effects and locations from the Star Wars universe, sometimes it tries to hard to be like Star Wars, like the fact that it rips off characters from the movies like a fake Yoda, Chewbacca, and R2-D2, but those characters turned out lame, but it does give you a look at some of the history of the Star Wars universe which is cool, in the end if you like Bioware, Star Wars, or RPGs, this is a great game you should look for.. When I was awaken by the game landing on my chest, I jump with excitement and played this amazing game spending two months of my life of non stop playing. I still play this game from time to time when I have the urge.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. While I never really owned many Xbox games, the ones I did own were absolutely amazing. I am not sure which one would be my fave but this one is among the top 2 with Elder Scrolls III.. this is with out a doubt the best star wars game ive ever played . it has a fantastic story with great charicters . the choice selection of things to say is pretty vast with some really funny comments to say. going good or evil is a real fun adventure as your decisions actaully feel like they are having a effect. the ability to wield duel light sabors is awsome . the combat system although not bad is alittle bit boring as all you do is hit attack and your charicter just starts beating down who ever he or she is fighting and you do little els outside of toss in a special attack hear and there and heal . the game is also abit buggy not terrable mind you but can get abit annoying at times. . the game is fairly long and will take you around 30 hours to beat which is pretty decent for RPG length . it also has a decent create a charicter section and the game feels like it adds more to the star wars lore . there is also 2 differnt endings which will give you another reason to run through this game. its a very solid RPG and should be looked into.. Outstanding RPG!! This game defines perfection as an rpg. The gameplay is a fun strategic way to wield lightsabers and unleash the force on your enemy's. The customization is near flawless, and the Story is the best part about the game. I recommend this game for any fan who truly appreciates RPG's you will not regret this experience. One of the best RPG's of all-time. The story, voice-acting, and dialogue are all masterful. It far surpasses the mediocre prequel films in every category other than visual effects.","the story is a masterclass in storytelling which rivals ""The Empire Strikes Back"" the choice system is all right but not as good as a Lot of other games . this is my personal favorite Star Wars game of all time ."
840.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge - Dimension Shellshock,"one of the best modern arcade game i ever played, funniest thing for me this days. I love TMNT:SR & DLC more than Streets of Rage 4 because it is vibrantly alive! SOR4, like Fight n Rage, has set a good Final Fight, but modern, standard upon the Brawler convention; currently in renaissance. Now, TMNT:SR adds some flavors to the meal from Technos of old time, if not from Konami. Online play, too.. This is exactly what the base game was missing. I absolutely loved the base game, I played through it multiple times, but the issue that I had was that there was very little left to do by that point. This doesn't reinvent the game, but it adds the fresh coat of paint that I wanted. It gives you enough reason to return to the game and keep playing. The two new characters are actually very fun to use, and while the color swaps aren't huge, they're a fun little bonus to those coming back and for long-time fans of the series. The survival mode is the core appeal of the DLC. Its exactly what you would expect of it, but it adds a few fun features, such as being able to play as some of the bosses. Again, nothing game changing, but they tapped into exactly what fans wanted and needed to get back into the game. New game mode, new playable characters, new stages, new enemies, new color palettes, new features - its excellent.. I won't go into detail, but: If you're sitting around wondering if it's worth it: yes. It is. it's really fun and has great replay value for the price. If you enjoyed playing this game, and you're looking for a reason to jump back into it for a while. You found it. Very good DLC for the price. Support these guys.. The game is already a perfect cake, with icing on top. This dlc would be the second icing on the cake.. just a boring beat em up game with 4 controls. only people who find it fun are ones who convinced themselves it is from liking the franchise","TMNT:SR adds some flavors to the meal from Technos of old time, if not from Konami . the survival mode is exactly what you would expect of the game, but it adds a few fun features . the game is already a perfect cake, with icing on the cake ."
841.Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Bad story. Terrible tartar. Worst Social Links in the series. And sooooo much more. Don't play this, or you'll regret. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Persona 3 didn't just reinvent the Persona series, it set a new standard for JRPGs; a standard that no other franchise has matched still to this day. Persona 3 is a stylish game that took the unlikely combination of sim life and dungeon crawler and merged it into something far better than the sum of its parts. Furthermore, every aspect of the game's design -- from story, structure, characterization, battle system, dungeon design, social links, etc. -- are all finely crafted to fit with the game's overall themes. Match all this with an engrossing narrative from start to finish in what could easily hit triple-digit hours, and what you had was the very best RPG on the PS2.. Easily the best entry in the series and one of the greatest JR-PG's in my opinion. The characters are great and so is the story. I wouldn't skip out on this one. If you can't pick it up on ps2, grab it for the PSP.. From here, Persona isn't Persona anymore... Persona 3 is a bad game. Unnecessesarily boring, awful voice acting, really bad combat mechanics, you can't control your party (meaning they WILL do what they want), your party can't use multiple personas, and the story... is just stupid Overall, this game feels like a crappy dating sim. Wanna know why? Social links... what's the point of it?. Persona 3 is one of my favorite games ever. Even the ""tedious"" parts of the game don't feel cheap, though that may vary from person to person. I love the way this game combines realism and mundanity with the fictional world and it's symbolism. It has a pretty good message about death which the later games get rid of (don't play them) and its story can honestly rival most smt games in their edginess and importance. Play this game if you can, it's on the cheap, it's on the darn PS2, and it's honestly one of the greatest JRPGs ever!. One of the best games ever man. The fact that it got bombed for no reason is some bull. If you can get past the depressing atmosphere and funky AI, this is a game with a gripping story and complex characters that stand the test of time.. Played on PlayStation 2. Gameplay: AWESOME. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: AWESOME. Dialogue: GREAT.. Persona games are the best japanese student simulators, but everything else in it is really poor. Fights are boring and frustrating at the same time, and story in P3 is really bad written. Main hero has almost zero impact on the course of events. Except beating shadows, main hero do completely nothing during all story. It's a shame that Mitsuru must landed in such lame game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I expected something better for all of the hype this really average franchise gets. All characters were boring anime archetypes with no flavor of their own. The story was an extremely generic premise that flows in the typical Japanese way of story telling like Light Novels. Tartarus, the main gameplay feature was fun at first but as you progress in the tower, it becomes more and more tedious by the second. In the end, I forced myself to complete the game. Bosses have a terrible gameplay design, for example the ones under the Millitary base, you have to kill the 2 bosses in the exact same turn or the one that wasn't killed will revive the other one ON FULL HP. No, they don't warn you about that, they never tell you about it until the first revive happens. One of the bosses even relies COMPLETELY ON LUCK. That's bad game design. He uses a move that spawns a roulette in front of you and you spin it and stop it. Whether you damage him for some small amount or he 2-3 shots you, that's up to luck. Whether you get debuffed or he gets debuffed, that's up to you.. Oh, did I say that there' s another boss fighting besides that guy? Yeah, 2 enemies at the same time. Not only you have to rely on luck but you also must simultaniously fend off that other guy who has an attack that can one shot you if you have an Ice based Persona. or leave you barely alive on about 30 hp if you don't. The whole game is riddled with badly designed bosses and the pacing of the story is bad. A story sequence happens and you're left with a whole month of free time before the next one. Either you grind which is boring, or do Social Links, which are just unfleshed dialogues that get the other characters attached to you. The characters seem to start loving you way too quickly. You go and say hi and you already got a girlfriend... (It's an over exaggerated example, chill.) I started with the P3P version of Persona 3 so I was happy that I get to walk around at first... but as soon as the novelty wears off you realize how **** tedious it is, constantly having to walk in a boring world just to advance the story a bit or do Social Links. You would wish for P3P's hub. Also, an additional -1 point for containing The Answer which is hands down the worst additional content I've ever played in any game. You play as the most boring character in the entire cast as the protagonist, Aigis and the whole thing contains **** enemy design and is extremely long for the little story it offers, you can just look it up on YouTube. Did I mention the whole thing is just grinding? Yes, THE WHOLE THING!. This game is creepy, and i love it. This game make me born in RPG world. Just make me feel alive. Persona 3 is masterpiece of Shin Megami Tensei series. JUST PLAY IT, PLEASE.. Persona 3 is simply a masterpiece of the genre. It simply takes every element that makes Shin Megami a revolutionary series, and makes deeper its charm. It's not just about its astounding RPG environment, but that special care in the relationship between NPC 's, main and secondary characters, giving a bit of fun to the academic experience. The art, compared to others behind and beyond it, is second to none, and demonstrates that the series has a lot to offer. A must have for every RPG player, and a must have for every PS2 owner.. Intriguing calendar based story, fantastic soundtrack and the satisfaction of being able to play the game two completely different ways... You can either grind in Tartarus (basically the twilight zone) every night to gather, fuse and level-up personas or you can spend time with your social links and strengthen your personas' potential and allow for insane fusible combinations. Incredibly unorthodox RPG (to those who are new to the SMT series). I put 110 hours into it !!. I suppose the biggest problem I had with this game was that I played Persona 4 first. Because of that I feel my experience of the game was not what it could have been. It is clear that this game is the game before Persona 4 as all the same mechanics are there, just in a far more raw form. I did really want to like this as much as I did P4, but I just could not get past the flaws that I think I wouldn't of noticed had I not played P4 first. Story wise it is on par with P4. The narrative is deeply engaging, but perhaps a little too transparent at times. Most of the characters are well developed and interesting, however not as flushed out as in P4. I never felt any deep connection to any of the characters, at least not to the same degree as I did for the P4 cast. I suppose it could be because there are perhaps far too many character and your time is spent to spread out to really feel a strong connection to each individually. Combat is practically the same as P4 however clearly an earlier stage. The inability to directly control anyone except the main character is deeply annoying at times. If anything, it helps you appreciate the P4 system even more. In game visuals are on par with P4 but the Anime cut scenes are clearly inferior. Soundtrack is OK, but doesn't feel as ...... personal as P4's. To round up. I know this sounds like me bashing on the game, but in truth I'm not. P3 is a fantastic game and if not for it, P4 would never have been. I just wish I could go back and play them in the right order. Overall: A great game, that is a little rough around the edges, but worthy of any JRPG fan's collection.. Excellent music and great characters make this game truly satisfying from beginning to end. The game can be extremely unforgiving if someone wants to get 100% completion on their first play through but, do not let that deter you. The boss battles are very challenging and the combat is fluid and makes leveling up less ****.. ATLUS always impresses me with their games. This one is no exception, in fact, this is probably my favorite RPG as of right now. All the attention to detail and things to do besides just explore and grind in the tower make it a stellar experience with tons of replay value.. I played Persona 3 FES, so I will submit this review for both the original and FES. Persona 3 is right up there on my list of ""greatest games of all-time"" alongside Shenmue. The story in this game is simply the best ever, it's emotionally engaging, great voice actors and really puts you in some tough positions when you have choices to make. This is RPG at it's finest. I fell inlove with all the characters here and I never stopped. The gameplay is top-notch, dungeon crawling has never been more fun, the combat is the best I've seen for a JRPG, the use of Personas gives it a nice, unique twist to it. When you're not in combat, you're either in the dorm, at the mall, in school or exploring the other areas of the city. There is so much to do, and the game is extremely long, took me ~80 hours to complete this. Oh and lets not forget the soundtrack, simply one of the best, if not the best, of all time. If you love JRPGS, great stories, and great combat, make sure you purchase this game, you WILL NOT regret it.. A downright fantastic game! I loved every minute...even when it was somewhat repetitive. The story, the characters, there is nothing that I didnt love about this game. Even when other characters would be mad at me I was entertained...albeit a little hurt. This game really shows you how important it is to form bonds, even though we are not all out to save the world. The story kept me going and I was sad to see it end. The persona system itself is genius and the social links just add to the fun. I HIGHLY recommend this game.. This is the one of the best JRPG on the ps2, and to me it still is because of its originality and how different was the common RPG where you're the usual hero and go on a travel and do dungeons: in here, you are a student and you have a life to handle too, by attending school, making relationships (which is needed), but also having the exploration in THE dungeon and train in order to go on in the game, and in this part of the game you'll end up using Demons, or Personas, which are basically your set of magic spells, stats, weaknesses and defense. Except for the main character, which can use any persona, thus can change his stats at any time, the others are fixed characters with fixed personas. and they'll usually behave according to their ""role"" (Yukari is basically your healer, while Akihiko is your physical attacker with few spells). Nothing original on the fighting system, but it works great, and the plot of the game is very good and dark, with some few twists as well, and the setting for the story is very **** with that said, I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone for few good reasons, actually 3: 1) This game is based on the dungeon crawler formula, which is basically ""One dungeon with lots of floors"", and that's it. Yes the floors are many (about 200+) and actually varied, but this formula isn't what many people expect on a home console and even though I don't mind I ""kinda"" got disappointed too on this **** well, at least it's explained and makes sense. 2)The relationships I've mentioned are actually a MUST: you have to increase the Social Links, which is basically a way to measure the relationship with a certain friend or person, and you need it in order to create better personas via fusion; with that said, the game is basically a mix between the first point and this one, **** can be a real big disappoint if you like more variety. But one more issue can be a problem, and that is...3) This game has a time limit!!! You have an (ingame) year of time to complete the game, but don't worry about it because you'll have TONS of time in order to finish, without mentioning time never actually passes when you do dungeons or play anything. But you still have a specific dead line and this aspect can be in conflict with the other 2 points, because you have to plan your interactions with your friends and ALSO train in the dungeon. Even though it's possible to increase all Social links to maximum you'll have to plan what to do next and, since you need to train in the dungeon, you'll won't be able to do some specific Social Links at night. Oh, you also have to train your character interaction stats (Charisma, Courage and Academics) in order to speak to some of them too! Anyway, these 3 points aren't real big flaws but I believe these 3 points can go in contrast and be annoying to each others, so that's why this 8, but if you like dungeon crawling, a good story, a simple yet good fighting system (I know the compagnions are AI controlled, but I actually had no big trouble with them, but yeah I wish I could control them), this game still and will remain one of the best RPGs on the ps2, and that isn't easy considering there are many good rpgs on it!. I wasn't particularly impressed, but it is pretty addicting. Normally anime high school based games aren't my cup of tea either, but something about this game's build up was much better than games I've played previously in this sort of gameplay style. At first I wasn't sure why this was M-rated, but then when I got to the part where you have to shoot yourself in the head in order to attack with your persona(s) it became pretty clear (it's not a message you want to send to kids). There's a lot of interesting things you have to take into consideration in this game that most other games don't consider - like resting and relationships with other people... (well I guess a lot of games consider this, but I don't play a whole lot of them) Anyway, that's pretty much why I find it decent. Not really the best reason I suppose, but hey, I enjoyed this game. (it's got creepy incoherent animated scenes). anime in general needs to pick up this game as well as Persona 4. The Social Link system is an amazing way to mix up the action, and the end result is a perfect blend of dungeon crawling, monster collecting, and visual novel. The grind might be repetitive, but the boss battles are great and the story/characters are amazing. Definitely not an RPG to be missed!",persona 3 is a stylish game that took sim life and dungeon crawler into something far better than the sum of its parts . every aspect of the game's design is finely crafted to fit with the game's overall themes . the characters are great and so is the story .
842.PixelJunk Monsters Deluxe,"A solid gameplay with variated styles of playing,a lot of level with great difficulty if you are not into Tower Defense games,with a Co-Op Mode to play with friends,and a multiplayer,you have to unlock places,levels and towers to make this a fully game experience for a very cheap price.. This game is so good. I have played it for more than 4 months and am trying to get all the rainbows. It is tough. The Vita is the perfect fit for this game. I can choose to control with the right or left stick and sometimes I switch, it feels very natural to do this. Graphics are crisp and clear, sounds are okay, the game play is where it's at. If a command and conquer comes out for the Vita, I would check that out in an instant. Really recommended!. Hopefully this does not double post, but... This is a great tower defense game, but the online version has become an area where weirdo pedophiles linger. I do not reccomend that anyone buy this game.. The best tower defense game in its ultimate form (all the islands + extras)... please bring the social network edition soon and poprt to iPad... can't wait to play more of this!","this tower defense game is so good. i have played it for more than 4 months and am trying to get all the rainbows. the graphics are crisp and clear, sounds are okay, the game play is where it's at."
843.Tales From The Borderlands: Episode 5 - The Vault of the Traveler,"That ending is just fantastic, the coclusion to the characters is so good, the final battle is done in a very clever way to make use of the choices u made, the plot twist are very good, this is my second favorite episode telltale has ever made. If you're reading these reviews to decide whether or not to buy or try it out then let me help: BUY IT! NO SPOILERS: I personally would give this game a 10 but it isn't for everyone. Telltale games are played and moved along like an animated graphic novel (but with decisions that you make along the way). Don't be fooled by this style of game though. You want action? Got it Excitement? Yup You want your choices to impact the future - Totally Deep well written characters - It has loads Variety? Of course Graphics that look great but can be played on a potato - Yep Epic finale that does not let you down - Ah-huh and a roller coaster journey through an beautifully created world - Damnit, yes! I could easily go on. Whether you've played the original or not does not matter - there are 'in-jokes' but they are so few that anyone who has never played a Borderlands game before would not even notice. Brilliantly told twisting story line - emotional roller coaster - and a ton of laugh out loud moments! Verdict: Buy it !. In my opinion, this is currently the best Telltale game series. It's about as perfect as a borderlands adventure game can be, and one of my favorite adventure games of all time up there with the likes of Grim Fandango. Oh and hey, CHOICES THAT MATTER! What a concept!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The whole Tales From The Borderlands series was the best Telltale game I've played yet and I have palyed all of them. Its funny, its tense at moments, it has fantastic music and the final episode is close to perfection. I cant think of anything there is left to improve with this episode. Thats why it is a 10/10 in my opinion.. This has got to be my favourite Telltale game ever and I played The Walking Dead season 1 Only Telltale can take an already immersive world that is Borderlands and put something of its own into it, just like they did with The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, but not so much with GOT They made original and refreshing characters that you cared about and related to and it made you cry and feel sort of empty inside when you had to say goodbye to them. They made a story so interesting and emotional that Gearbox allowed it to significantly affect the Borderlands universe ( you know what I'm talking about ). Voice acting is simply superb, the music is fitting and memorable and every element of this game is just perfect. Thank you Telltale for this amazing journey and experience, for making me feel like I haven't felt in a while.. This series is perhaps my favorite movie-game from Telltale. Its quirky. Its dark. Its funny. Despite the game has 1 ending, you get to choose how your behavior is with Rhys and Fionna. The casts are lovable. Vaughn is just a badass accountant. The only thing disappointing about this movie game is the romance and I hope this gets addressed if Season 2 is ever made.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I haven't written a review for anything on this site for years, but after playing this I feel entirely obligated. I am a huge telltale fan and an even bigger tales from borderlands fan. Not only is this the best episode in Tales from Borderlands, I think its the best episode in any telltale endeavor, and thats saying quite a lot. All plot lines are wrapped up neatly and nicely, even the aesthetic choices have meaning and the balance of humor and intensity is perfect. Better yet, It sets itself up for a VERY interesting season two. If you ever doubted this telltale franchise, give it another chance for the sake of getting to this episode. If you haven't given these types of games a shot yet, tales from borderlands is the perfect place to start and this episode is really something to look forward to. It goes to show how well written and humorous this series is, as outside of telltale, I'm a much larger fan of ASOIF, Fables and The Walking Dead. But really, this is the best of the bunch in my opinion.. I waited until the whole season was out to play and I would recommend that approach a lot. That feeling you get when you just start watching a show that's been out for seasons and don't have to wait for the cliffhangers to resolve. This episode was the finest of the lot, the first four are all degrees of good, but they were the legwork for the crescendo ending to the season this episode is. If you've played TT games before, you know how the mechanics work, so trust in their storytelling ability to play this game and let it bring you along for the ride.. Holy...Freaking...Damn. Marvelous. A masterpiece. I actually registered just to review this game, yet I find myself in a loss of words to describe how goddamned awesome this is. Its been years since a game affected me in such a emotional level. I couldn't stop laughing, or crying, or giggling, or slack jawed at all unfolding events. Its just so clever, so brilliantly conceived that it raptured me on my chair and didn't let me leave for hours. I wasn't even a fan of this lore, I rushed Borderlands 1 just because I'm a huge fps fan, but I never payed attention at anything surrounding me. I got this game in a steam sale out of curiosity and couldn't stop playing it, it exceeded all my expectations, and now I wan't to know everything even remotely related to this lore. It also got me into telltale games and oooohhhh boy am I having the time of my life right now. It's a must have if you love adventure, action, amazing storytelling and dialogues, impeccable voice acting and **** you just wanna have many hours of pure. bonkers. fun.. Everyone thinks they are the heroes of their own story... For me this series is the best games i ve played this year. Because it adds so much to the freaking borderlands universe. But this review should be about episode 5. So yeah episode 5 is definitely the best out yet so far. Everything comes into conclusion everything is explained expect for ending that honestly i don't really know what to think about it. But expect that this episode was perfect. 10/10 But ending really left me confused. This series got so much humour, action moments, emotional moments, choices that really weren't that easy to make. I m gonna even say it out loud I ENJOYED IT MORE THAN THE WALKING DEAD AND WOLF AMONG US there i m done just, buy it. Do it. No possible way you will regret this. For me game of the year.. I haven't Wrote a review since Episode 1. I decided to do a complete summary of all the episodes. This is probably the best of all the Telltale series. I'm a huge Walking Dead and GoT fan but this was simply incredibly enjoyable. I don't want to spoil anything so all I will say is that the story is a 10 and every episode will leave you wanting more. Not to mention the ending was amazing. A must buy for anyone. Even if your not a fan of Borderlands you will still love this series.. Emotional moments, great humor, awesome action moments and masterpiece in choices in all of game make this a powerful and perfect final chapter. Telltale Games did a great job again!!. An almost perfect ending to one of Telltale's best series. Basically what everyone else is saying. I can't stress how great this game is. The final episode is just the icing on the cake. Well done Telltale.. I absolutely loved this story. From beginning to end I sincerely hope the next borderlands actual game follows these characters further on another adventure. Just a beautiful story told with the perfect sense of humor.. Simply fantastic, the choices finally matter, the ending was a bit of a cliche buut I'l let that slide, I honestly had fun and I believe that it couldn't have been done any better.. Telltale Games company strike again! There is enough space for rude jokes and sentimental moments and they're equal enough. Every character can't be considered as a bad one or a good one : even villains cause sympathy. The game deserves its score as 20 out of 10 : 10 for Fiona and another 10 for Rhys.. This game does not deserve a 1010 score, but I enjoyed all the hours I spend on it and I want more, so hats off to TellTale on this one. blablabla 150 characters.. It's just reminds me of how great a Telltale game can be. I can't stress how good it actually is, you must to play it to feel how funny and sometimes emotional it can be. I loved it! And I'm quite sure you will love it as well.","if you're reading these reviews to decide whether or not to buy or try it out then let me help you decide whether or not to buy or try it out . in my opinion, this is currently the best Telltale game series . it's about as perfect as a borderlands adventure game can be ."
844.LostWinds: Winter of the Melodias,This is easily one of the best WiiWare games available. It is completely fresh and original and the controls are so ingenious. The game is clever from start to finish and the puzzles are balanced perfectly between difficulty and fun. The game is of reasonable length for a WiiWare game too. Graphics are very clean and beautiful to look at.,the game is clever from start to finish and the controls are so ingenious . the game is of reasonable length for a WiiWare game too .
845.Gone Home,"Succeeds immediately on mood, with an eerie atmosphere that opens many possibilities on what the plot will ultimately reveal. The result ends up being moving, a masterclass in pacing, with story details slowly portioned out in each room before a hopeful ending closes out a melancholy tale.. Definitely worth playing! Ignore the haters. It’s dated a bit now, but it was innovative at the time. Im glad I played it.. Can't find a single bad review that isn't in Russian or doesn't have woke or sjw in the text. Strange, huh? Remember when they made a superhero gay, then they told gay people to write their own stories, then gay people did, so these vice signalers review bombed games they never even played? Almost like people have never heard of a point and click adventure game. Gone Home is a bite sized, atmospheric, point and click adventure game about coming home and exploring the house your family moved into while you were in Europe. Much of the story is told brilliantly through the environment as your character has been away for a year so you must piece together what your family has been up to since you left. The story mainly focuses on your younger sister but you also learn what your mom and dad have been going through. Anyone who wants to make immersive 3D games should be forced to play this game and learn how to show, not tell, when it comes to conveying information in a game. We don't need walls of texts inside 3 layers of menus to learn about the lore of menus, seeing three boxes of your dad's unsold novels, or your sister's rough drafts for her fantasy novels tells us so much about the characters and their struggles. I can see if the game is too slow for some or if you don't feel you have enough agency as a player, but it's a point and click walking simulator, what did you expect going in?. Short game, can be completed within 2 hours but the story is what matters the most. Great music, really good voice acting. I was curious about the game. Amazing atmosphere, well written story. I was on the edge of my seat and wishing all ends well.. Gone Home skillfully weaves a touching story through exploration, evoking curiosity and nostalgia. Its masterful execution makes it a must-experience title.. Not-a-game who nobody remember or care anymore.. Maybe one of the best games I have ever played! It's an intense story-driven experience for roughly 2 hours!. pretty good walking simulator, i loved the immersion and the story. One of the first walking simulator. I am a person that really enjoys atmospheric games, where the setting and details are rich in detail. From the little tapes that you find, and put in the radio, to the little items you can interact with to enrich the story telling it was really enjoyable. There weren't that many ""puzzles"" at all, and made it for a very good game to unwind and get the feels for. The narrator had a really good voice, and really good voice acting skills. It was fun exploring the whole place. Those that have rated this game low might not be those kinds of gamers that enjoy a laid back story telling sort of approach. But I enjoyed it.. I created a Metacritic account just to warn others about this awful, awful game. The entire game consists of going from room to room, pointing at everything everywhere until something glows, then zooming in on it and turning it around. Rinse and repeat for a measly 55 minutes. That's literally the entire game. Nothing ever happens except a woke teenage love story cliché that had me rolling my eyes. It's basically a ""look meticulously through a storage room of just tons of old junk"" simulator. Ultimately, you click on a random notebook and it fades to black with a short voiceover and the game is over before anything ever happened... yet IGN gave this a 9.5 probably because it's WOKE!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. An okay, short game. It was basically a movie, both in how long it was and in how little gameplay there is. I played it curled up on the couch and it was good for a quiet evening.. Steve Gaynor, founder super-vocal and militant SJW behind the studio was removed from his leadership after numerous of his own female employees accusations about creating a toxic environment. Working for him was described as: ""working for a high school mean girl. His go-to weapon was to laugh at people's opinions and embarrass them in front of other people."" Shocking. The guy that got a lot of press for himself by verbally assaulting and attacking other dev studios at GDC for not being woke enough, is in fact, a toxic, bullying hypocrite in real life too. It's sad we have 'professional' reviewers fall for loud-mouths like him, defend, and get behind them because they picked up the hot button topic of the week - while he and the people on his team that were bullying and bad mouthing people on stage. Activists that are bent on creating hate and conflict are NOT people you defend. As for the game, this is a walking simulator that I didn't even finish because I found it short, boring, and with lots of other MUCH better games out there. The only reason it's even known is because he played the media to get behind him based on it having a homosexual girl. Wow. That's all it takes today folks - just pick a SJW topic, become toxic to get press behind you, and profit. In reality, if I wanted to get preached at for 1-2 hours by angry people bent on burning people that don't agree with them, I'd go to church. This game has proven to have no staying power, is never seen on best-of lists anymore, and is not revolutionary in the least. All it did do was expose the fact that reviewers are more interested in tripping over themselves to appear more woke than any serious criticism.. I didn't like it at all, and to be honest, thank goodness I played it for free via Epic Games. It didn't involve me, I found it flat, banal, with a gameplay absent to the nth degree. The ratings it got from the critics were incredible so maybe I'm the wrong one.. Gone Home has come a long way since it was released. When it first came out it ran horribly on Linux and happily I can say that is no longer the case. It will be tough to talk a lot about the plot of Gone Home without spoiling it so I will simply say I enjoyed the story and liked how it was presented. You arrive home after catching a late flight to an empty house and trying to figure out where your sister is. Your parents are also not home but that is more of a side story. You have to explore the house trying to find clues. When you find certain ones it triggers a audio journal from your sister. You can also learn a lot about your parents lives and that of your late uncle if you dig around enough. I liked the form of many of the clues such as crumpled pieces of paper; diaries; letters; etc. You will have to find combinations to many locks as well as keys. It is a little convoluted at times as you will have to start finding wall panels to tear off and secret passages, I can’t imagine the cleanup after I was done searching. The game really nails the nostalgia of the 90’s well. It takes place in 1995 and I can say they hit on many things I remember doing back then. The music is also great for the time period. One thing I will also mention is that, while the game is not a horror game, it did a great job having some creepy horror vibes at times. There are times where between the rain storm going on outside; the creaky floor boards; and the music that I expected things to take a grim turn. The graphics are mediocre to decent. The object detail such as furniture; appliances; etc were decent to good. The shadows and lighting were a little sub par but not terrible. I played Gone Home on Linux. It never crashed on me and I didn’t notice any bugs or glitches. There is an AF toggle; an AA toggle; an AO toggle; a Vsync toggle; an FOV slider that went from 60-90 and 3 other graphics options. The games save system is to save on exit and there is just the one save slot. Alt-tab didn’t work. I did find the mouse movement to be a little funky where it felt slow and unresponsive at times but normal at others. This didn’t seem to correspond to a frame rate issue as that was always 60+ FPS. The game seemed to use 100% of my GPU for much of my play through, which given the detail level seemed odd, but the performance was great. Game Engine: Unity Graphics API: OpenGL Save System: Save on Exit Disk Space Used: 3.03 GB Input Used: Keyboard and Mouse Settings Used: AO; AF; AA; Bloom on; Motion Blur off; Shadow Distance at Max; 90 FOV @ 1080P GPU Usage: 1-100 % VRAM Usage: 1667-1876 MB CPU Usage: 16-33 % RAM Usage: 3.1-3.5 GB Frame Rate: 72-121 FPS Overall if you enjoy walking sims you should give Gone Home a try. It has a great atmosphere and story as well as really nails it’s time period. I finished my play through in 110 minutes although I didn’t find all possible clues; journal logs and secrets. It is easily worth it’s current price of $16.99 CAD. My Score: 8/10 My System: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 580 8GB Gaming X | Mesa 21.0.3 | Samsung 970 Evo Plus 500GB | Manjaro 21.0.5 | Mate 1.24.1 | Kernel 5.12.2-1-MANJARO | AOC G2460P 1920*1080 @ 144hz. Absolutely boring cr@p full of sjw sexual agendas of a lesbian teenage girl. Writing is non-existent, it is utterly banal and boring.. I thought it's be something like a Stanley parable, it turns out to be a pure SJW **** Gaming ""journalists"" overrated some crap again because it panders to their political ideology.. Very nice game and quick to complete. A very simple graphic adventure in which you have to collect diary pages in order to complete the story they tell. History is truly a swing of emotions. Other than the wonderful storyline, the game doesn't offer much high, but it's still a very enjoyable experience.. It's a very interesting story, with a cool atmosphere. There are some gameplay stuff that are bothering me, I don't see any point in picking up toilet paper billion times etc, and sometimes looking at objects wasn't working properly, or the fact that there was no actual model of character I'm playing (shame), but other than that I had fun playing.. There's not much that stays in your mind about this game. So many moments make you reflect, but every time you have to realize that the authors have missed the development opportunity. I am sorry to say that this game is not worth the money.. This is an example **** walking simulator. It gives the impression of a horror game, but in reality, it is a very well written young adult story. Voice acting is top notch. It takes about two hours to beat the entire game, but it will keep you engaged the whole time. 8/10. Honestly, the game was fine. I rated it a 4 because the game relies upon the story to elevate it, but the story has little to no depth. The story of the sister was a roller coaster, but ultimately you learn everything you need to in a matter of an hour and a half. I don't know about other people but for me to really gain emotional attachment to characters and stories, I need more than an hour or so of 15 minutes of setting the stage, an hour of build up, and 15 minutes of payoff. Nothing about the game is dumb, but nothing about the game really warrants you actually experiencing it either. For the most part, the parts of the story that I felt were supposed to hit hardest, felt like things I've read, watched, and personally experienced a dozen times before. Who would I suggest this game to? Someone who can relate to growing up in a two child family, with parent issues, who moved to a new house in the middle of nowhere and one of the two siblings has difficulty connecting to others like most. Also, you shouldn't spend more than $5 on this game.. The gameplay was boring for me and it made me disappointed. Therefore I didn't enjoy it. 2hrs on record.. Clunky game with shallow storytelling. Maybe this was innovative back in 2013, but in 2020 Covid-central it's just plain boring! I expected more from the subplot but it was just left hanging. I guess that a LGBTQ+ story was seen as new and exciting back then, but things have seriously moved on. Plus the movement is so slow, she walks around like she's on sedatives. I only paid a fiver, so I guess that I shouldn't have expected too much.. For the purpose that this game tries to achieve, it's perfect. For me, Gone Home was the game of 2013, and I would love for this story to be continued, to find out what happens with the family. What mostly stands out to me, is the voiceacting, the musicscore, the interaction with the environment and the level of detail found around the house. This is a story-based first-person game, where you must uncover the story as the game progresses. Curiosity carries the game, and you are like a detective trying to find out what has happen. I respect that this game is not loved by anyone, but for me it ticks all the boxes for what I love in a game like this. It has funny, sad, serious and lovely moments, and the dynamic of the game changes as you learn more about the story. And I like this story, and I would like to know what happens next.. An okay slowpaced walking telltale game. I like the story told about Sam, and it's a good voice actor that are nice to listen to. But it feels a bit hollow, they could've done more with the story and they could've included some puzzling or something.. I don't like these kind of games. In fact, It's not a game. There are no mechanics, there is no plot. We should call it an interactive story and put it on some new shelf, and don't compare it with actual gaming.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Got this game for free, so I would be more lax. OK immersive mansion walking simulator. Story in my view is weak, a bit cliche and not thrilling enough. Somewhere at the middle **** you understand what is happening and it becomes boring. If you want something like this one but better - try ""What happened to Edith Finch"". It is much much better.. There is a lot of love put into this game. Sure its short , theres no gameplay and no puzzles which is a missed opportunity but its still really immersive to lose yourself in the house. The story is decent and theres a nice twist at the end. Overall i enjoyed my experience, it still holds up in 2020.. I've played this game just now -- April 8, 2020. It took me 105 minutes to complete it where I left just one stone unturned. Here are some points. Pros: - The game has a great personality and is very effective at building a strong, impactful atmosphere. - The character stories are generally likable and enjoyable to uncover. - Graphics are pleasantly surprising. - You can interact with a large portion of the environment. - There is a level of eerieness that never really leaves. Mixed: - It isn't very difficult to navigate through the game to move the storyline forward which means playtime is short. Cons: - Incomplete lore. There are some lines of the story which I believe would be better explored than left up for interpretation. It's disappointing to uncover some of the potentially interesting parts only to be left without a resolution. - The story is incredibly easy to piece together quite early on which damages the impactfulness at the end. Extra Notes: The problem with this game is that the content is easy to navigate while not leaving the consumer with much reason to come back for more. Being so linear, someone who pays for the product might be left wanting and disappointed because it does take less than 2 hours to finish the game... But you can tell how much time and effort went into making this game. It is *very* well crafted and I do believe that many of the negative reviews come from an audience that is not receptive to the story. User ratings must be taken with a grain of salt (and so should critic ratings) because we have to understand that not all people will appreciate the content. TL;DR If you can get it on the cheap, this is a great game to spend 2 hours on. The story is charming and the world is wonderfully interesting to navigate. Just understand that this is an investment for 2 hours of your life, not a massively mastered and developed game that will give you 60 hours of gameplay. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for nice, niche storylines with no pressure on the player. Play at your pace. Enjoy the environment.. I got this for free and for the 2-3 hour gameplay I got I feel like 20 bucks aren't worth, wait for a sale. However, the atmosphere is dripping and there were times where I felt unease with the storm in the background and the occasional voices in the basement. The story is bittersweet and so heartfelt, I really enjoyed this game. It starts off with a creepy sort of feel but slowly reveals a love story along with many little secrets hidden in the nooks and crannys.. This doesn't even qualify as a game. All you do is read notes left around the house. The only reason people give it good scores is an attempt to ""validate"" it's themes. Guess what? We had lesbians in video games back in the 90s we didn't have to make a big deal out of it and they actually had good gameplay. Look up Fear Effect and it's sequel if that's all you want to see out of a video game.. Even allowing that the game is now 6 years old I have to agree with the person who said the high critics' scores are a indictment of gaming journalism. If you want to see this gaming concept fully realized and executed to a very high standard play Life Is Strange (trust me, you won't be disappointed). Gone Home is like a short, low rent version of that game - or to be fair, Gone Home is more like the creative progenitor for LiS and similar games. If you've read other reviews you already know the basic premise: on Wednesday June 7 1995 the player returns home on short notice after a year in Europe and finds neither her parents or younger sister are home. She then has to wander around the big, old house to piece together the events that transpired during her absence, essentially by searching the house for clues. The game uses sound effects of the ""It was a dark and stormy night..."" type and lighting to create mood in the big old house, not without effect. But literally the whole game can be completed in about 2 hours and involves nothing more than finding various documents that piece together the story, supplemented by voice overs of your younger sister narrating key passages from her journal at key points. The voice acting is good and the story - as far as it goes - isn't terrible, though it revolved around a theme that in 2019 is a bit of a cliche (and wasn't exactly fresh even six years ago). I strongly suspect that the story draws heavily on the personal experiences of one or more of the developers, and that it was likewise well received by people who can relate to it at a personal level. As for the rest of us - well, it's just ok. There are legitimate ""feels"" here, as the kids say, but only of a superficial and transitory kind. The story just isn't long or deep enough to be really engaging. You can also see the developers toying with additional story elements that could have been fleshed out to make a more substantial game, notably including ""Uncle Oscar"", the house's former occupant, who went crazy or something (this is never clearly explained), some backstory to the marital problems of the player's parents (which are very conventional but nevertheless could have been exploited for dramatic effect), and the teasing of potential supernatural elements. Unfortunately none of these possibilities are developed. Oscar has no backstory and the ""haunted house"" teases go nowhere, while the subplot about the player's parents is only developed insofar as it is required to explain their absence. Did the developers run out of time and money before they could realize the game they really wanted to make, which is so often the case, or did they just aim low and never intend these elements to be more that cheap atmosphere enhancers? Don't know, and upon further reflection I probably don't care. I can only reiterate what so many before me have already said: the ending is abrupt, brief, and provides no real sense of closure. Frankly it feels like a ""we're out of money so we need to get this thing out the door"" moment. This could have been a very good game with another year or two of development and a commitment to a more fully realized story and a somewhat more interactive environment incorporating things like simple puzzles. As it is the interaction in this game is with doors, light switches, picking up objects to examine / read them, and the one time you needed to enter a combination (there are actually at least 2 other locked containers in the game but I never found a combination for them and obviously didn't need them to complete it). If you enjoy this sort of game and are perhaps interested in the evolution of the genre it might be worth a playthrough at the current price of about $5 (I would certainly not pay more than that). Otherwise you're better off moving on as this is niche product that has nothing to offer beyond a short, simple, passably well told story.. I did not pay for this game and would not pay much for it. If I did, then I might give it a low review for its value. In terms of the overall experience, it was merely okay. I wasn't as offended by the ending as others. That said, this game is all about story and there is not a good story in this game.. Very slow game, easy past , the narrative was interesting, but not that much, will not recommend it. Uninteresting, uninspired story. Forces you to perform repetitive tasks, such as opening doors and flicking on light switches. This is all the 'gameplay' you're going to get. Not deserving of anyone's time or money. Go for Firewatch if you're into walking simulators - that one's a masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. too many bad reviews for an okay game. i wonder if it is related to the story being about a lesbian teen couple instead of hetero-broken-hearted-man's-self-pity. Walk around a boring empty house, read and listen to stuff. That is the entire ""Game"" . but you cant really call it a game. theres no gameplay. Just walk and look, The only thing interesting about it is how is exposes the stupidity of gaming journalism, giving this junk stupidly high score because its easy and they like easy game , because they are bad at games. Honestly on of the worse experiences I have forced myself to play ever, I had to see why it was getting high scores though and now I know it shouldn't have. If you rate game high, just because they align with you political views, you should not be reviewing games. imagine you're going out to a fancy restaurant for the night. The waitress pulls up to your table, she ask's for what you would like to order. You reply with ""surprise me!"", the waitress scribbles her notepad, ""coming right up"" she responds and leaves. 10 minutes later, she comes backs a lays an empty plate on your behalf. That's Gone Home, $20 bucks please.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If you're allergic to feminism, homosexuality or walking simulators, then you will hate this game. Actually it's not a game, it's just interactive visit of someone's house. But I loved it. All subplots of the main story (sister's sexuality, father's middle age crisis, problematic marriage, ...) are something that was explored in literature, movies or other media hundreds of times. Yet it still grabbed me and didn't let go until credits started rolling. But for a game that takes 1-3 hours to finish (depending on how much of a completionist you are) the price of (currently) $15 is way to high.. The farther I get away from my playtime in this game the less favorable I find it. I originally scored it a 10, but now I would say it's an 8. I did enjoy it, and it does what it does well but I don't think the act of playing it is actually all that enjoyable, IE I don't want to play it again.. This game it will give you thriller moments but in the course of history you will get what is happening. Don't get baited by the many low reviews, this game is good. You have to respect the gameplay that is slower than usual and try to understand the history.. Gone Home is 'walking simulator' with simple but highly detailed story about ordinary family. It has as few gameplay as this genre can maintain while still being called 'game'. But the storytelling through items is really nice.. Not a bad game, but VERY SHORT. I thought it was a horror movie. The game itself is used only as a vehicle to tell a story. Reminds me of ""Heavy Rain"". The visuals are acceptable, the sound is good. Voice acting is very good. It is interesting to piece the stories (like in Resident Evil, Bioshock, etc), but I think the story could be deeper. Since the story was the main point of this game, it could try to achieve storytelling as, for example, ""To the Moon"". If there was some kind of replayability, like changing the player and the timing, changing points of view, putting more story and arcs, this game could have been very good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pretty hard to rate this ""game"" accurately. To me, it's not even a game, but a boring simulator, even Twilight is probably more interesting than that piece of junk, YES I SAID IT! The unique reasons that my rating can't go any lower is because despite being a big scam, this game doesn't even have relatively bad graphics or musics and the writing is good, if that was a book it would easily get more praise and I could give it something like 8/10. The unique people that enjoy the game are either people that have never played games before, SJWs or even people with very low standards and that put story above everything. Do not play that shiet.. Game review of gone home Gone home is a first-person simulator experience. You are playing as the character Katie and you are finally home, but your family is not. You go through the game searching thoroughly for clues to where your family members have gone off to. The game is a well-made first-person experience. The game holds the standard of games that was when the game was released for windows I 2012, but the game doesn’t meet the top standards of the modern gaming industry. I think the graphic is generally well done, but you can find someplace that are sloppy made. None huge places or spots, but just so that the games graphics are a little under the good modern standard. The game starts off with you coming home from a trip. You must find a key to unlock the front door. Then you explore the house to find more about yourself and the other main and side characters. The main objective the game is to find facts about your family and where they have gone off to. I think the game captures the atmosphere of where the game is set, which is in 1995. The furniture and other decorations looks like the classic 1990. The Greenbriar household is a perfect remake of the atmosphere of 1995. I think the graphics are suitable for the setting the house provides. The sounds in the game are very well made to the atmosphere. Sometimes I think that the music and sound make you distracted from the main objective and makes you day dreaming. I would say that this is a good thing because it makes you more in depth in the game and it makes the game more immersive. The voice overs from Sam that you find when you explore the house is a good feature to the games atmosphere. The sound effects from the outside noises such as the rain and thunder are also well made and make you emerged in the gameplay. You are given great instructions and the game is easy to play. There are very little controls that you need to use to play the game. In general, I liked the game. I think it’s a great first-person simulation and walkthrough that make you emerged in a new time and atmosphere. I would recommend this game for the age 13-24 because the game is about paying attention and remembering things that you find in the game.. Game Review: Gone Home takes place on June 7th, 1995 and you play as Kaitlyn who returns from a one year long trip abroad in Europe to a completely empty house. Through a series of notes and letters Kaitlyn discovers what has been taking place in the lives of her family members in the year she has been gone. You as the player has to search around in an enormous house to find clues to what has happened to your family. The game itself has a little creepy undertone, even though the game is not made to be scary. Most of the story revolves around her younger sister Sam and her budding friendship with a girl named Lonnie. Journal entries are shared with the player whenever they discover a relevant item in-game. The storytelling and voice acting in the game are absolutely superb and the gameplay has a really easy flow that makes each move seem organic. As you unlock more and more of Samantha's journals you will want to find out even more what has happened to the Sam and her parents. I think that Sams confusion, bliss, excitement, and frustration was portrayed brilliantly. I think that the story is quite good but I am not sure if the two-hour long experience is worth the 20 dollar price tag. This is not because the game is bad in any way, it is just because the game has no game replayability value since you will find out everything on your first completion of the game. If I was to rate this game, I would give it an 8 out of 10. This is because the game is well made and exciting, but it is not my own personal type of game. But I would recommend everyone to pick the game up and give it a try.. The game gone home is a mind and story game. In the game you will have to think a lot to get all the stuff and journeys that you must have, to complete the game. To complete this game, you have to be smart and think logical. If you do not like story games, this is not a game for you. This story is about a girl and her personal journeys. Throughout the game you get to know some of her stories, because you are picking up things that make her speak. After spending a year gallivanting around Europe, you've come to your family's new home one rainy night in June of 1995, and although you expected your family to be there, you find the house empty. As you explore the house and find out what the Greenbriars have been going through, there are no puzzles to solve, no enemies to defeat. There's nothing to take you out of your journey of discover. The main character is Samantha greenbriar. Gone Home is a remarkable first-person adventure. The player takes the role of Katie in the first- person view, who can view objects in the game using the mouse and move using the keyboard. There are no set goals in the game; however, the game encourages and rewards the player when they explore new areas of the house and search for new messages. This game is an amazing game because of the huge map you have to search to find all the information you need and all the journeys. I really think that this game should be used as learning game for people. This game challenges you to think and that is a very good thing for students who does not really like school. I recommend this game for people over 15 years, because you’re thinking skills has to be on point.. The main character Kaitlyn arrives home after a year abroad. She expects her family to greet her, but there is no one home. Something is not right, and Kaitlyn must search the throughout the house to find out what. The good things about gone home is that non-structured exploration. You get a big house all by yourself, to explore and do whatever you want. The freedom and the fact that you must find out a lot by yourself in the game, I really like. The story of the game is an emotional, relatable and relevant story today. The game portrays homosexuality well, and it tackles problems like abuse and bullying in a good way. I think the graphic is very well done",Gone Home is a point and click adventure game about coming home and exploring the house your family moved into while you were in Europe . much of the story is told brilliantly through the environment as your character has been away for a year so you must piece together what your family has been up to .
846.The Last Friend,"This is essentially Plants vs Zombies with dogs! The devs have done a really admirable job rehashing the classic Plants vs Zombies genre here with the added bonus that your character is actively involved in all the battles! They have included other cool features too like maps and cut screens ahead of each battle to try to flesh out a bit of a story to accompany the action. I really enjoyed playing this game, but there are just a few things to be aware of: 1. The load times between transitions seem un-necessarily long 2. The difficulty seemed to really spike about two thirds of the way in 3. It can be difficult to keep track of the position of your character when the action really heats up. Despite these issues, this is definitely worth a play though if you are into tower defense games.",the devs have done a really admirable job rehashing the classic Plants vs Zombies genre . the difficulty seemed to spike about two thirds of the way in . the game is definitely worth a play though if you are into tower defense games .
847.Bustafellows,"Very poor pacing and game. I’ve played almost all the otome games that have been localised to date and I can confidently say bustafellows is the worst one. The pacing and plot is absolute terrible. The villains are very one dimensional and each route has multiple random jumps for shock factor that becomes completely forgotten. I don’t mind **** focuses on love or the plot as long as they are well written. Unfortunately, bustafellows fails terribly at both. It’s an absolute mess **** yourself a favour and skip this game - alternatively you can shut off your brain and try to enjoy this poorly written game. The effects and the cgs are quite nice so there’s that.. Loved how incredibly unique every path was. Sometimes surprisingly so. I always expect one clunker in an Otome game but in this I found every character to have something unique about them either as a character or with the plot you get involved in with their path. For example one character may not have the best romantic path, or stand out as a character, but their plot line is so incredibly captivating that you just get so invested. The only thing I didn't like about this was the time rewind mechanic feels sooooo tagged on without explanation or sense. This is obviously a world where super powers do not exist in any way, shape or form but somehow for plot purposes we are supposed to just suspend disbelief for this one character. It sticks out like a sore thumb and is just utter nonsense but I understand it's need to help get a plot off the ground. Overall though this is one of the better visual novels I've had the pleasure to play. This really just reinforced how Otome games just seem to work really well and gets me to want to play them more often.. I was really astonished at the quality writing of this otome! My favorite love interest is Scarecrow!. Right out of the gate I’ll admit I’m a bit lost in trying to summarize the Bustafellows experience, but regardless I won’t deny it has style and attitude to burn. Mixing together a somewhat motley (but I’m sure intended to be quite cute) crew of criminals with your main character who is a female journalist in search of a big story (but who has an ability move back time just a bit and inhabit others), it opens the door to fleshing out the game’s characters and motivations in unexpected and unique ways. With your choices feeling like they have greater consequence than the average visual novel the level of engagement is pretty impressive, but ultimately whether it’s a game for you really rests on how much you like the unusual premise and whether it sounds like an experience you can just enjoy the ride with or whether it may be a bit too odd for your tastes. ****/2021/08/mini-reviews-august-4th-edition.html. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best visual novel I have played. Hands down. There are just too many positives to put here. The voice acting is phenomenal. I usually advance at reading pace, regularly cutting voice actors off, but found myself waiting on every single line of this game before moving on. The delivery of the actors felt like it really added an entire new depth to the story at multiple parts - especially when Teuta was speaking. Her voice actor is absolutely brilliant. The story was fantastic. Sure, there may be some suspension of disbelief, or a few moments of plot holes - but I honestly don’t remember any of them at the end of the day. I loved the fact that this game continually took you to dark places and serious topics - it didn’t shy away from real life conflicts and I couldn’t love that more. The blend of humor, heartwarming, and thought provoking content was an intense breath of fresh air from the other games I’ve played in this genre. The characters - oh my god. I literally love every member of this cast. Each one feels like an important member of this team, and the game would be lesser without any of them. I went in expecting helvetica to be my least favorite, but even he grew on me by the end of the second or third chapter. They’re all flawed, but in relatable and great ways that make learning about them a pleasure. Finally, the protagonist. Teuta may be one of my favorite heroines in a video game for the past few years. She is strong-willed, but not stereotypically so. Hearing her put forth very mature, and sometimes vulnerable, replies was fantastic. I loved how she was so well rounded by the end, I honestly felt like you could guess her responses to things before they happened. Other VN have this nasty habit of having the protagonist be this weak, submissive, doorstop that just sits and watches the problems be fixed for them. Teuta is not one of those protagonists. She felt like a true member - and a valuable one at that - by the end. She earned her spot through determination and her own morals, and I love her so much for that. Overall, this is a truly fantastic visual novel in my opinion. If you’re looking for serious romance, you will be disappointed - full stop. The most that is in this is chaste kissing in most routes. However, if you want a fantastic cast of loveable characters, I cannot recommend this VN enough.. If you liked Collar x Malice then you will like this game. It is very action-packed and deals with things like gangs, corruption, drugs, etc but at the same time it has a lot of lovable moments. I love the interaction between all the main guys and I really like how they all get a chance to shine. One bad thing about the game is that it can be kind of glitchy near the start. You hear people talking but you don't see text. This didn't take away from the experience and only happened near the beginning. Overall a great game",the pacing and plot is absolutely terrible . the villains are very one dimensional and each route has multiple random jumps for shock factor that becomes completely forgotten . the time rewind mechanic feels sooooo tagged on without explanation or sense .
848.Bomberman Blast,"I loved this version of bomberman! It's the best way to play it. You have multiplayer, both local and online (when it was still operational) and a wide variety of game modes. It was only 1000 wii points, which is pretty cheap for a game with very high replay value. With the shutdown of Bomberman R online, it's probably worth looking into finding a way to play this (wink wink) In one sentence: Best way to play bomberman.. And alas, another Bomberman game. This one available ONLY on WiiWare. And then, you get that feeling when you start playing it. A feeling that tells you It's going to be a ""blast!"" This newer, funner, harder installment to the franchise won't disappoint. As it includes 8 player Wi-Fi battles, fresh looking graphics, new ways to play, and more! Including faster more complex gameplay to keep you on the edge of your seat. Although Wi-Fi suffers a bit because of sudden connection loss for no apparent reson, it is still a must have for all Bomberman fans alike. People new to the series will also enjoy it in all it's wonderful splender. It earns a well earned 9 from me.. Play this game online or with friends and you have the Bomberman formula working at it's peak. The solo experience however is a tremendous letdown as it contains no story line.. It's Bomberman! Everything you would expect is packed in this WiiWare title, and of course it really is best played with friends at home or online. I did find the graphics to be a bit hard to see on my smaller HDTV with the 16:9 setting, but your results may vary on larger displays. Challenging and fun; a good starter for new players and longtime fans of the Hudson franchise.. If I spent more time playing online matches, I probably would have enjoyed it more. But otherwise, I feel like I blew off 15 bucks for something I could have on my computer.. B.B. is a great game if you have people to play it with (the more the merrier!) However, frequent disconnections online really took away from the whole wifi experience. If you have friends that can play offline or if you don't mind getting disconnected in the middle of a match, I say go for it.","8 player Wi-Fi battles, fresh looking graphics, new ways to play, and more . solo experience however is a tremendous letdown as it contains no story line . if you have friends to play with, the more the merrier ."
849.Kirby's Epic Yarn,"Kirby's Epic Yarn is one of the most ascetically pleasing game this generation, the way Nintendo works yarn into a gameplay mechanic is really cool, and makes for a very visually appealing experience. However, Epic Yarn really isn't that challenging, even when going for gold medals, so it really just ends up being a very basic game under the guise of a very visually appealing effect. By no means does this make Epic Yarn a bad game though, but more so its a pleasant experience of seeing a visual style collide with gameplay mechanics, its different and that’s whats worth noting.. pretty poggers i wish i could cut up kirby with scissors though and also it isnt dusty which means it isnt realistic. It’s a fun little game. Nothing to write home about. Game is challenging enough when going for a high score. Cute graphics.. (9/10) - I beat this twice with my neighbor and brother. Beautiful soundtrack and just a charming game.. Great 2D platformer. The ultimate example of choose your own difficulty. You can't die in this game, Angie will save you no matter what, meaning you can stroll through any level of the game without issue. At the same time Angie is the most evil being to have ever given form. If you want to keep you gems, to attain all the bonus levels and items you will be put through a gauntlet that tests your nerves. Is it the hardest thing out there? No, but it sure is challenging and quite a lot of fun. Achieving 100% in this game is both rewarding and not too large of a task compared to most other games, if you play this I'd say try for it. The hotel decorating feature is more fun than it has any right to be. I have the best Kirby room and none of y'alls can match it. My only gripes with the game is the lack of additional content when compared to other Kirby games. There's no arena and no extra mode, which is disappointing. Would recommend if you like platformers are want something to do with a friend. 15-20 hour game to complete.. Kirby´s Epic Yarn is one of my favorite games. The game is great, I like the challenges, the music is excellent, the design is accepteble and the rest is just great.. The differential from the formula of the old Kirby games does not ruin this one. It doesn't exactly help it either, though. While this game lacks almost any difficulty, which is even less present in multiplayer, it is still colorful and fun enough to be another good game in the Wii's library.. i've played 4 kirby game and this is the most boring, no interaction, no good gameplay, terrible. One Of The Most Creative Games Ever Epic Yarn is by in large a perfect game with it's concept alone.. Kirby is so thicc that it makes the game so beautiful, kirby is so great and is s tier in smash bros. I don't have the Wii version of this game but, the Nintendo 3DS will make a greater success!. This is the most fun I have ever had with a game, this goes way back with me, and I can't recommend it enough. Seriously, It's amazing.. Kirby's Epic Yarn is really my all time favorite game. I'm so close to giving it a 10 however the game is really a cake walk and the lack of difficultly makes the levels feel short at times.Other then that I really do not have any other complaints about the game. The variety of things to do in the levels and the levels designs themselves really make up for the lack of difficulty. Everything is picture perfect in Epic Yarn like the controls,soundtrack,colorful graphic,and the variety of game play elements through out the game.I have never played anything like this and Epic yarn is more valuable to me then all the money and materialist things out **** to mention this game really gives me all the hope for humanity and good in the world.This game is as cute as kittens and **** really would have to have no heart or imagination to hate or dislike a game like this. I know this might be a unpopular opinion, but I think this is the best Kirby game ever. It might be because this was my first Kirby game I had ever played when I was like 4 or 5 years old, but I still love this a crap ton now these days.. You know, I don't remember the last time I disagreed with the general public to this degree, and I don't remember the last time I felt so conflicted about a review. I generally enjoy the ""Kirby"" series, and I quite enjoyed the latest adventure in the series, ""Kirby Star Allies,"" but after completing this game, one that critics and fans have sung the praises for ever since its release in 2010...I honestly felt nothing. I walked into this review without a numerical score in mind, because the game as a whole just made me feel so...whatever. And I wanted to love it, because I always find myself enjoying the ""Kirby"" platformer games, but this one didn't really leave an impression me like ""Kirby 64"" or ""Star Allies"" did. Obviously, ""Kirby's Epic Yarn"" has some very pretty visuals that keep things interesting and inject a cool, child-like charm into the game. The game itself is also very easy to get into, the controls are pretty smooth, and the gameplay is relatively varied overall. As always, Kirby retains his signature cute charm in this game, but unfortunately, he gets bogged down by a few other unfortunate problems. For one, short length and lack of difficulty are once again on full-display here, and while you could argue that, since this is commonplace for ""Kirby"" games, it's not such a big deal, in the case of this game, you know it's a problem when you technically can't ""die"" in the game. It unfortunately comes off to me as a bit too streamlined and too child-proofed, robbing whatever challenge the other games in the series may have. Along with that, some of these new gimmicks and forms in the game occasionally control kind of awkwardly, which can be annoying when you go from ultra-smooth, accessible platforming into a tank that can't seem to aim without turning nutty. And finally, the game is just dull. I'm sorry, but even with the childlike-design, pretty yarn aesthetic and all that, it just feels so empty to me. I feel nothing while playing it or after playing it, and the emptiness made it hard for me to love the game. Guys, I'm really sorry, I wanted to love ""Kirby's Epic Yarn,"" but unfortunately, I just happen to be in the minority here. All I can say is that, if your curiosity is intensely high, give it a shot and you might walk away with something special. Otherwise, there's several other better ""Kirby"" games to pick from, this one just isn't quite worth it. Sorry, Nintendo. I wanted to love it but I just can't. I hope ""Kirby's Return to Dream Land"" (which I obviously haven't finished yet, because if I did I'd be reviewing it) is good! Final rating: 6 out of 10 ""Decent"". Tastes differ, but for me, it is one of the best platformers(and Wii games) which I played in my life. Everything is perfect here, in my opinion, level designs, music, graphics and everything else.. Kirby's Epic Yarn is cute and amazing in terms of visuals. The gameplay is simple,b ut game throws at you a few fun ideas. in my opinion best easy-platfomer to play with younger siblings.. Kirby’s Epic Yarn is a game which is devoted to its aesthetic. The premise of the game is that Kirby has been transformed into yarn and drug into Fabric Land by an evil wizard, and he must make his way through said world (optionally with Prince Fluff as player 2) to save the world. Unlike other Kirby games, Kirby has no ability to **** up bad guys in this game. Instead, Kirby has a magic lasso with a star on the end of it; this lasso, when it strikes an enemy, unwinds them. If you hold down the attack button, it will wind the enemy into a ball of yarn that you can throw at your enemies, with some different enemies’ balls of yarn having subtly different effects (a few act as enemy-seeking missiles or give you a multishot). However, mostly, the balls of yarn are the same thing, though there’s actually a pretty good variety of enemies, with over 70 different types (though in reality, there’s probably more like 40 or so that are significantly different). The levels make use of the yarn aesthetic in other ways; the lasso can be used to cling to buttons, allowing Kirby to swing around. Sometimes Kirby can pull on a thread attached to a button and cause the landscape to bunch up or shift in some way, and there are also zippers that can be unzipped in a few locations to reveal new areas, or fabric to be furled or unfurled to do the same. There’s also a few narrow spaces that Kirby can unwind himself into a thread and literally thread himself through, though these spaces don’t play a very large role in the game, with only a couple levels through the game making any sort of significant use of the mechanic. This game’s “coins” are beads, and every level has a large number of them, along with two “treasure” items (which can be used to decorate an in-game house) and a music CD containing the level’s soundtrack. Collecting enough beads will earn Kirby a bronze, silver, or gold medal, and between levels, beads can be spent on fabric, on furniture from an in-game store (again, both to decorate your in-game house), and to add rooms to a building so that characters who give Kirby challenge levels to complete will move in. These challenge levels consist of things like races, carrying an object to the end of a level, collecting enough beads in a certain amount of time, and killing enemies within a time limit. These challenges and attempting to 100% the levels are the source of most of the challenge in the game, as the game proper is extremely easy – Kirby literally cannot die in this game. If he falls off the screen, he is picked up, dropping some of the beads he’s picked up, and put back on the level. If he runs into an enemy, he scatters his beads around him like Sonic after getting hit by an enemy. However, unlike Sonic, Kirby won’t die even if he has no beads whatsoever, meaning that it is literally impossible to fail at a level. The levels take about 10-15 minutes apiece if you explore them thoroughly, and there’s 36 of them in the game in total, scattered across eight worlds. The real highlight of the game are the game’s 7 bosses; each of the bosses has its own unique attack pattern which changes over the course of the fight. These boss fights are quite elaborate, and the bosses themselves are markedly more difficult in many cases than the rest of the game. While the patterns are all different, in the end, when the boss becomes vulnerable after being hit, Kirby can pull on a button attached to them to unwind them; over the course of the battle, they will gradually be unwound, and eventually will unwind completely (or break free of the strings being used to control them), complementing the game’s aesthetics nicely. The game also includes a half dozen or so transformations; most of these are pretty gimmicky, though they all change the gameplay fairly significantly (apart from the dolphin, which mostly just makes you much more agile in the water). A couple of them turn the game into a scrolling shoot-em-up, while others alter the gameplay in other ways, such as just driving in one direction or sliding around on a snowboard in one direction. While they mix things up a bit and give some mechanical variety, they’re all too limited to really feel all that great, and the train in particular is particularly bland and gimmicky. In the end, this is a decent platformer, but I can’t say that I’d really write home about it. The aesthetic is neat, the game is still visually appealing even many years later, and the bosses are pretty cool; however, outside of the bosses, the levels never really feel all that impressive, and even as I sit here the game is blending into a blur in retrospect. Clocking in at about 20 hours to 100%, this is not a terrible investment of your time, but there are better platformers out there.. My favorite canon Kirby game as of now and for quite some time. Not only does Kirby still look great as yarn and, you also have the option to take your time or speed-run the levels, which look absolutely gorgeous! Who knew that fabric and stitches would make Kirby's Epic Yarn an inevitable masterpiece? If you haven't experienced this glorious Wii entry, I recommend ANYBODY and EVERYONE to give this game a go! No game experience and gamer god's are hand-in-hand on this 2D platformer.. Kirby is turned into Yarn! Well maybe that's a good thing cause this game is awesome! The graphics are cute and they look like wii u graphics and the gameplay is amazing so is the controls. The story is something creative and kirby can turn into things like cars and tanks and much more! This game is great and will not be bad at any point.. I am a big fan of Kirby, but I found it strange this game got the highest rating of all modern kirby games (2000-2015). The art style was amazing, but I didn't like how you couldn't die, and it felt more like a kids game then any other Kirby game. Still a great game, but I would rather play Kirby air ride.. Too easy for seasoned gamers, but it's great if you wanna play co-op with a parent or a child. There's a nice amount of minigames and secrets to find.. Its hard to find a game with as much charm and creativity as kirbys epic yarn. This takes a big risk in having kirby not being able to inhale enemies or die and that might be a turn off to classic kirby players. But believe me when I tell you that this game is one of the best in the series. The sheer fun factor this game has is immense. Colorful levels fun form changes amazing soundtrack and awesome 2 player make this game great. You are yarn kirby you use yarn to solve puzzles defeat enemies and traverse the beautiful land you are put in. The bosses are some very unique ones and are very fun to play. so in conclusion this is a game you cant miss and is a must own for any fan of kirby.. Kirby's Epic Yarn is a masterpiece; one of Kirby's greatest adventures yet! In a beautifully designed yarn world, Kirby must gather the magic yarn to stitch the world back together! An adorable little game that's almost impossible to hate!. This is one of the most beautiful game I have ever played. While you could argue that it's too easy, although a few of the timed bonus levels are tricky, that would be missing the point. The game, just like say an animation film like Miyazaki's Totoro, is primarily conceived for children. However the creativity and level design on display here are simply breathtakingly inspired and delightful.. This game is fantastic it's so cute, sounds great and is fun to play the level design is good and the controls are tight This is my favourite kirby game (PRINCE FLUFF FOR SMASH BROS. 4). This is a great game. I'm probably the only one here still doing reviews for Wii games, but if you happen to know anyone who still play Wii games recommend this to anyone.. I may have given this game a ten, but there's not a selection for 9.99. Anyways, this game is AWESOME!! I got this one the year it came out (2010) and played it to my heart's content (which is 2 years, until I stopped playing it and started playing Dream Collection. Sometimes, I still go back to it and wonder, is this game actually as good as I think it is? Well, I play it and I know is is as good as I think it is. I know this seems like a overrating review (I am a HUGE fan of Kirby), but believe me, it is a special treasure to cherish for a long time. It surely is memorable to play, especially with a friend! One tiny, tiny, tiny problem was that you cannot die. Oh, wait! That's not a problem! The games already hard enough to complete!. You have two teams when it comes to Kirby's Epic Yarn, you either have the people who adore the game and accept it for what it is or you are part of the people who didn't like the changes and think that it should have just used the controls of traditional Kirby platformers; I would probably say I am kind of in between these teams, I liked the whole yarn concepts used in this game and I thought they were cool and had some fun and simplistic graphics but on the other hand I would have liked traditional controls, it was kind of weird playing a Kirby game where you couldn't ""****"" anything up, not to mention this game is very easy due to the fact that you cannot die, but hey it's a Kirby game, typically Kirby games are not supposed to be hard due to them kind of being geared a little more toward kids. Besides, it doesn't need to be challenging, it was fun anyway, there were some bland parts, but it was enjoyable, I guess it's worth picking up unless it's still $50 New.. This game is not for everyone, but I personally enjoyed this game. It may be quite childish, but who cares. This game is great fun and very relaxing to play at night.. I play this game with my 4 year old. He loves it and laughs a lot. He likes to pick my kirby character up and throw him across the screen. Very like Super Mario Bros but without the difficulty spike (at least for me).. Perfect for young kids- with a nicely narrated story- and it`s sheer platforming goodness for us old folks too.. Game: Kirby's Epic Yarn Genre: Adventure Developer: Nintendo/HAL/Good Feel System: Nintendo Wii Total Score: 86/100 Value Score: 8.6/10 • Story: 8/10 • Characters: 8/10 • GamePlay: 9/10 • Graphics: 10/10 • Sound: 10/10 • Music: 10/10 • Length: 4/10 • Replay Value: 8/10 • Player Value: 9/10 Pros +Unique art style and design makes this game a rare gem +Gameplay quite innovative +Has the Kirby charm seen in past games but amplified numerous times +Music consists of few new tracks and remixes of classics which is great +Sound effects are nicely done and brings a new depth to the atmosphere +A lot of customizable options let you decorate your ""house"" to however you want it to look like. Cons -Too Short -Too easy -Impossible to die even if you fall down into a pit -Challenge is in keeping beads and not on survival makes this game too simple. The last thing any of us expected from a Kirby game was something involving yarn, cloth and absolutely no inhaling and cloning. What kind of Kirby adventure is that? Answer one of the best Kirby games we've played, and one of the best games on Wii. What Kirby's Epic Yarn lacks in difficulty it makes up for in sheer charm and ingenuity. The game's commitment to its bold visual design is what sets it apart from most games, allowing players to tear, zip and generally unravel the world around them. We're all more than excited to see Kirby's next Wii adventure, but Epic Yarn was a breath of fresh air for a franchise that often does very similar things time and time again though that's not necessarily a bad thing.. I will be the only person that will be negative about this game. I know it looks good and yes I know it is very cute and looks it does sound really good but its not Kirby. This is a game that Nintendo wanted to make and had every right to make but why put Kirby in it. The Kirby franchise is one of my favorite series that has ever been made and it kinda makes him look less like a pink badass and more like a pink little jerk. I like been able to turn into a fire breather and a guy that looks likes Link but instead of him been old school Kirby he was turned into something so cute it made me mad and very upset. He is not yarn he is a monster eating alien. I hate this game with all my heart and I want people to hate this game but that is not going to happen anytime soon.. A very easy game, mostly cuz you can't die, but the side challenges are pretty hard at times, the story is adorable, as are all the characters, possibly my favorite kirby game to date. The graphics are amazing for the wii, the gameplay is very fun, and is enjoyable for all ages, and the bosses are fun and easy for younger kids, a must have for all wii owners! If you like this game, check out Kirby: Return to Dreamland, you won't be disappointed!. I like the Kirby games. the gameplay is fun and simple, while also keeping things challenging, not to mention how awesome characters like Kirby and Meta Knight are. Epic Yarn, however, I found to be way too simple and cute. the story, like most Kirby games, is pretty simple. it is a pretty enjoyable story, and manages to be pretty funny at times. The gameplay, shortened to the point, has been butchered to be way too easy. Kirby can do things in the environment, like become a car, or use an ability meant for a certain area, like a tank. this is a pretty cool concept, but the problem with it s that you can't die in the game. beads, which determine your score at the end of the stage, are lost every time you fall into a it or get hit by an enemy, making it impossible to lose this game. I can see Nintendo making Kirby a bit easier, but here, it's way too easy. the graphics for the game are pretty nice. the environments and colors for this game shine, making it one of the nicest looking games on the Wii. the soundtrack for the game is very lighthearted. all the tracks in the game sound very cute, almost a bit too cute. tunes in Kirby could give a great beat and rhythm while also sounding cute, but here, being cute is all it sounds like. if there's one thing I cannot stand in this game, it's Prince Fluff. he's such an unneeded character in the game, and is seriously bland in general. In the End, Kirby's Epic Yarn is a good game, just probably not for Kirby fans. while it can be enjoyable with its story and dialogue, it can be a shut off for some by being too cute or too easy. if you're trying to get into the Kirby series, start with this one. just be prepared for the challenge other Kirby games will have.. No need to speedrun this game. Just enjoy the beautiful graphics and level design. This is the kind of platformer that takes things slow. It is pure art. One of the most underrated wii games around. Tons of fun.. Yes. this game is terribly easy and probably suits kindergartners more than your average teenager or adult but guess what? Some of us have three and five year olds and it is great to have a game like this that is not only easy enough for the wee ones to play (without having to hold their hands through the whole thing) but it is at its foundation an excellent platforming experience for those of us who want to relax. If I want to throw my controller or feel my heart race, I'll go pick up Super Meat Boy or something. Hard games are great, but that doesn't mean easy games can't be just as good. This game looks fantastic and I constantly find myself tickled at little animations and the like. It does what it does very well and if you're looking for a bit of a challenge, look elsewhere. My only issues are that you can't **** up your enemies and you can't fly like Kirby is used to. If it had those things, I'd have given it a perfect ten. I love it and my kids love it. It's relaxing.. This game just couldn't be better !! Gameplay is amazing, two-player co-op is incredibly funny ! At the end quite difficult ! Thanks Nintendo and the other important developer !. I'm not a big fan of Wii games, not as a general hatred towards the system or Nintendo, I love Nintendo, but too many games force utilization of movement with the wiimote and then have extremely poor response causing poor gameplay. Whether it's a product of the WiiMotion Plus, which I admit has fixed a lot of motion problems with the Wii, or just really good development behind this game, Kirby's Epic Yarn has no motion mechanic issues and provides a really fun and creative change to the Kirby series. The levels are clever and you can change the environment to your advantage sometimes using your yarn whip thing, attacking enemies is a bit different and neat as you lasso them and whip them around. It's a fun little game that you can spend a good several hours on while going through a decent story. It's not the best game in the world, but it's one of the best games on the Wii and a good addition to the Kirby franchise. It's a solid 8.. This game is so easy I could pass it with my feet. It's not just easy, it's BEYOND easy. it takes serious effort to find this a challenge. There IS no game, because there is no way to **** just do anything, or hold down the right button and close your eyes, you can probably make it through that way. Buy it if it's for a 3 year old, because at 5 I was already passing Mario World and this would have been boring to me. But if you're three years old, go play it. Now, the good. The art is good, without being exceptional, the polish is good, it's a very polished baby toy. There are probably more good things in this game but I am not in the mood to discuss them, this game is everything wrong in this world, because it,s not even a game, I don't see how you can call this a game.. Who said easy was bad? whoever it was, they were wrong. This is possibly my favorite 2D platformer on the Wii, it looks fantastic, it plays perfectly and is just so great! Seriously, I love Kirby games, this is possibly my favorite one. Only complaints I have are small: It's a little too short (due to how fun it is) and the co-op mode isn't amazing, but that just might be down to the fact that I like playing most games alone. Now stop reading this (if anyone is) and buy this bright, cheery game that is sure to put a big grin on your face.. I've never played a easier kirby game than this, you should at least be able to die in this game. graphics are amazing, though, and you can have sooo much fun while playing this, however, you won't be playing this game for very long. About 10 hours and you will put down this game for a week, but if you want a game extremely creative and fun, this is it for you. And despite being so easy, there is an aftergame and playing 2 player than greatly enhance the gameplay.. Kirby's Epic Yarn is a delightfully charming platformer. It's graphical design and general sense of childlike imagination is a joy to behold. You can't die in the game, so it can be played easily by younger gamers without fear of frustration. There is also an unobtrusive co-op feature, which works well and is great fun. For the hardcore gamer, Kirby's Epic Yarn won't offer a challenge, but it will offer a lot of stress-free, relaxing fun.. this game brings back somemany childhood **** seriously if you're gonna mark points off this game for being to easy all i can say is whats wrong with you......this game is fun and there's no hurry this has a relaxing soothing **** besides people some of the best kirrby games aren't challenging at all.....this game is fun and **** you could play with a buddy and play through the levels....this game also has stunning graphics as **** a whole world of insane creativness.....even the bosses are insanly **** your a person who struggles with intense fun video games try this game........trust me even though the game may look like its for a two year old it **** fourteen and i seem to like this game still and i've had this game for more then a year............ A fun but different type of Kirby game. The different type of Kirby's you can be in this game is what makes it fun to go along with the levels. The multiplayer is much more fun to complete this game than solo. Although a fun game to play, replay value is some what dull. I suggest playing the first Kirby on the NES over this game.â. This game is good. When I first started it, felt like it was for a preschool child but once I played it for a bit I found out how fun this game was. It is a cross between little big planet and super mario bros. If you like those titles or are into platformers you will like this game alot. Worth every penny you will like this game if you give it a chance.. I agree with KlassicKritic's statement in which you do not need difficulty to have a good time. Never before has a game ever made me feel so warm and fuzzy before. The calming music, hypercute (and textile) graphics are bursting with joy, even if it is impossible to die.. Kirby's Epic Yarn is bubbling with youthful vibes and bubbly motifs and even though it felt a bit awkward playing a game with such childish themes, once I began to play through the excellent platforming levels, it was easy to see that Kirby's Epic Yarn may be youthful, but the game play is mature. Game play is unique due to the yarn-based theme with Kirby able to use clothing accessories, such as zippers and buttons, to advance his goal to save Patch Land. Difficulty is where the game suffers and depending on how you play the game will depend on how difficult it will be. But even if you played for 100% completion the game is never extremely challenging. Just make sure that when you decide to play it, don't let the childish themes turn you off. You will miss out on an excellent platformer. .. The scenarios of the game were all built in a very creative and the end result was excellent. The mechanics is very different from other games in the series but that does not become a negative factor because it is still possible to use several new skills. Its downside is that it is extremely easy.. Perhaps it is cliche to use a cloth-related pun (as so many others are sure to do), but there is no denying it: Kirby's Epic Yarn is sure to make you feel fuzzy inside. The perfect game with which to relax in a blanket and drink cocoa on a cold winter's night, it deftly combines fun and intuitive gameplay, a piano-driven and lovely soundtrack, and of course, the timeless yarn-inspired art style. Most shocking (and pleasant) is its classy and completely non-gimmicky use of motion controls in certain sections. This is one game that deserves to be in any gamer's collection, regardless of age or attitude.. It's a really fun platformer, some guys say ""it's super easy"", but WHY you need something hard when you have something fun? The game has some of the best graphics i ever seen, the **** fits perfectly in the game mechanics, the framerate is not messed up and has really awesome soundtracks, a nice work with a piano.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Kirby's Epic Yarn, or Price Fluff's Epic Yarn With A Coat of Kirby, is not a 'Kirby' game. While it does feature the pink puff ball, all of his powers and uniqueness of his games are exchanged for this game. The Kirby characters feel tacted on, forcefully. Epic Yarn feels a lot like Good Feel's previous work, Wario Land: Shake It, You enter the level, get through it, find all the (beads) money you can, find hidden objects, and finish the level and graded. Rather rinse repeat, then boss battle. Unlike Wario Land, where the hidden stages are found inside levels, hidden stages are opened by racking up big money in boss fights. In this game Kirby can not die. He just loses his money when he gets hit or falls off the map. In a way this makes the game easy to beat and no challenge. The real goal is to collect all the hidden objects and get more money, if you feel like it. There's also useless apartment decorating and minigames as well.. 8.5/10 = Great!! = A flawed, but fun platformer.. Creative and Fun! GRAPHICS: Pure imaginative joy. 9/10 ADVENTURE: The story is weird but the fun is top shelf. 9/10 MECHANICS: This game is very easy to pick up and play. 9/10 EXTRAS: Having Epic Yarn in my game library provides two excellent functions. First, it is a great children's/'terrible at video games spouse' game. Second, anyone who can experience this game and not smile has some serious problems, it's like hating Mr. Rogers or puppies... watch out for these people.. It is just the opposite to all the modern games; it is good, simple, old fashioned fun. The way that the art style is woven (pun not intended) into the fabric of the game play is wonderful. The music is typically cheerful, and the game has innovation written all over it. It may be easy, but truth be told, the game is not about its difficulty, its about the fun had along the way, and Kirby's Epic Yarn delivers emphatically.. This game has too high a score. The game was fun, but WAY too ea","the way Nintendo works yarn into a gameplay mechanic is really cool, and makes for a very visually appealing experience . Epic Yarn really isn't that challenging, even when going for gold medals, so it really just ends up being a very basic game under the guise of a very visually appealing effect . the game isn't dusty which means it isnt realistic ."
85.Sid Meier's Civilization IV,"A great game.Used to play it a lot, it was a lot of fun to be able to start in 4000 BCE (or in some mods even earlier like 10 000 BCE). Civ4 gives a sizable roster of buildings and units,many of which have their own nice, such as seige Units which are good for weakening cities and collateral damage units which can strike a stack of units and do damage to a large amount of them. This was before they started going so strong on DLC meaning you could get away with just buying a Complete Edition with all the expansion packs and colonization. The game is made even better by mods, while officially you can only install 1 at a time in reality if 2 mods do not conflict you can combin, there is a JSON and Python interface for modding which makes it easy, I even tried when I was young to mod, the mods are what makes the game good and mods in this version are generally better than 5 (which some people consider skipped but I think is just now starting to go strong) or 6 (which generally grew pretty slow in the begining). With mods like Rye's and many many others this is a great modding experience, especially compared to the base game, large mods provide new depths tothe game and add the missing peices and add much more choice andmakes it require much more strategy and allows for bigger worlds and starting earlier (which I like as I prefer Middle ages and earlier history). I even got Civ 4 to work on Wine in the past.. Stacks of Doom, and long periods of time a new player isn't sure what they should be doing. Kinda understandable.. it's geared mostly towards the fans of Civ 1-3. Also has some pretty cool mods.. have not played. accidental score. Civ IV is the best entry of the franchise. After getting into the mechanics, I played about six hours without a pause. Overall rating: 9.2.. As good as all previous civs, with beautiful graphics and more options... Objectively the best civilization of the saga, but each new version loses freshness step by step. definitely one of my fav civs as of late but I don't like the happiness system feels like a bottleneck and I don't care for city-states and there's too many barbarians but its soooo much better than civ 6. Lots of fun nation building in this game. Interesting factions and development. Leaders ahd strong character and campaigns seemed well balanced. Big upgrade from Civ3, which was excellent in it’s own right. Game nails pretty much everything. Even the add-ons are excellent. I haven’t played the sequels so I can’t compare with them.. My truthful honorable incorruptible conclusive rating of this considered game: 5.. I hated this game after Civ 3. But now, I changed my mind. Pros.: - The main advantage - it's simpler and faster. Game mechanics now are super convenient. There is no need to make dozens of units. Just have one dozen and it's enough to advance your troops. - Religion made some problems but with the proper management it creates a deep boundaries between neighbors. - Sharing borders is not a big issue now. - Dimplomacy became significantly better. - More civic policies. Cons.: - Maybe the same as before. If you fail to invest in the army at the beginning - you're done. The neighbors will attack. - A bit complicated with the city attacks. But it elevates the role of the artillery. Developed further in the following games. So, it's almost a perfect game. Lol. 20 years ago I would have said it's a disaster.. very addictive very nice game if I need to compare among all other games by the way.. Maybe the best installment in the series. The level of detail on strategy is satisfactory and I really enjoyed my time playing it.. Fantastic game. Rich, complex, profound, fun. A great game, maybe really amazing only with all the expancions, especially with Behond the sword. Great game, with enormous amount of content and abilities to explore. Very high replayability. It's always cool game to play. From year to year mostly graphics changes but in this case it's good.. When I found out that Civilization IV had been out for a couple of years, I was still playing its predecessor. And if it weren't for the dozens or even hundreds of hours I've spent playing Civ3, coupled with fatigue from its limitations and dumb AI — Civ4 could, potentially, became my favourite instalment in the whole series. Looking back, the fourth part seems to be the most polished and competent iteration of the iconic franchise. Especially if you compare the basic versions, without the paid DLC and add-ons, which the creators of the series are so like to abuse nowadays. Sid Meier's Civilization IV inherited the best features of its predecessors, polished its mechanics and made a lot of small changes and improvements to the well-established formula. Thanks to a much more user-friendly and informative interface, fancier graphics, mature stylistics (hello to cartoonish Civ6 and Revolution) and FullHD resolution support — the project looks and plays pleasantly to this day. And the amount of starting content, old and new civilizations, as well as the presence of alternative leaders are surprising. Of the drawbacks, I could mention the traditionally inadequate behaviour of the AI (especially when playing at marathon speed on huge maps with the maximum number of opponents), as well as the ""unfair"" difficulty, which increases not via the ""cunning"" AI, but through a system of bonuses for computer opponents and penalties for the player. But both of these problems are the scourge of the entire series, which the developers have successfully ignored for over two decades. Despite its solid age, Sid Meier's Civilization IV is a great starting point for getting to know the series, especially if you're not interested in online multiplayer. Unlike the newer instalments, Sid Meier's IV is much less demanding in terms of hardware and finances but is just as addictive.. Good game but failed historical background lowers my ranking. This game could give a lot education but instead gives only propaganda.. By far the best Civilization game vanilla. With mods it takes on the entire 4X genre. OVERALL - 93% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 6/10 Story - 5/10 Game Length - 10/10 Characters - 6/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 7/10 Sound Effects - 9/10 Soundtrack - 9/10 Replay Value - 10/10 The best Civ game since Civ II. Leonard Nimoy adds so much character to the game and I'd happily play this game even now.. A good place to start playing Civilization and a fun gaming experience. Its strategy, history, and thinking all coming together to craft a masterpiece ****. Overall, this game is something everyone should play.. I really don't understand how people can find this ... enjoying or playable. The only good thing about it is claiming land where to build towns, the rest is a complete boring joke. Making roads turns into spaghetti mushed everywhere. Armies are nothing but stacks that take forever to fight, or instantly, that's it, just 2 options, wait 1 hour or 1 second with 0 animation. The battles are also unfair. It's like a dice roll, everything random, i mean basically caveman vs my 21 century soldier and still manages to kill 2 of my units? Really ? Spam towns, spam units, spam battles. Spam Civilization should be the name of this game.. This is probably the best entry in Civ series. Considering when you have all the expansions. 8 out of 10.. Best of the Civs, an 8 for its time, even though the game play on the board with the tiles and army movement is quite limited (and the balance for the army part as well).. Cult strategy. One of the best games of all time. And one of the best parts in the series. Graphics for 2005 is not bad. The gameplay is great. Additions to the game are excellent. This game has no bugs for me. In general, the game gets 10/10. Very good and addictive game. Also very good in multiplayer. It has somewhat of a learning curve but stick with it.. I have played thousands of Civ IV games -- literally -- mostly at the low-moderate levels of difficulty, viz. 'Chieftain' and 'Warlord' levels. I've enjoyed the game immensely; this game certainly deserves its 8+ score, but is not without its aggravating AI aspects. It's pretty common to have high, i.e. relentless, levels of barbarian activity early in the game; this can greatly score you down and compromise your chance of eventually getting good score. Personally I pursue a strategy of peace and rapid educational economic growth, however almost inevitably another civilization will attack you unprovoked. Some opponent civs, notably Montezuma, will attach even without prospect of beating you; you will eventually hold them off but at the cost of a huge set-back to you score. The only way to perhaps avoid or hold off attach is to invest in huge military resource. Apart from these annoying AI quirks, it's a great game.. Great game. First actual match I played I wasn't paying attention, Walked through India and got demolished by Nuke-Gandhi. Full points for realism.. The best Civilization game at the time of this review. Some later installments might have added some better features or streamlined some aspects a little better but Civ 4 was the best complete package. If you can find the Beyond the Sword expansion you should try the Rhyse and Fall of Civilization mod: THE best Civ mod ever that totally recreates the game. Civilizations appear on the date they did in history and each has 3 difficult to accomplish historically relevant victory conditions that make each civ a unique play through. I nearly played that mod more than the base game.. A thousand times better than Civ 5, a million times better than Civ 6. Definitely the best of the series, and nostalgia has nothing to do with it. Buy this game.. 1 of the most anticipated game through my life, next to Starcraft 2 and Sins of Solar Empire. The game is quite a good time-consumer which are varied in different way to win or deviate a plan on every part of the game. Good time to spend on 6 hours ++, Good animation, less 'buggy' and its awesome. CIV IV is fun to be in multiplayer and Skirmish, even it doesn't have campaign. THE verdict is, its a real-time long chess match to be honest.. I'm really amazed that anyone could rate this game below an 8 for any reason. IMHO Civ IV is the standard that all other strategy games must be measured. Even Civ V is a step backward. The flexibility, the options and different strategies you can employ is simply staggering. I've now played through at least 50 times, and will keep at it as long as other games fail to measure up.. This game is absolute crap. Being a Major Gaming Critic, This is the worst one I have played. Sure, I would give a 9 to Sid Meier's Civilization 4: Beyond the Sword, but I really hate this dull and life-wasting game, with no good civics, not enough leaders, and not enough units.. This game is a waste of money. You sit there clicking mindlessly when it prompts you for new research you just click some more. There is no point to the game, it wants you to believe that your choices mean something, but it doesn't. It's a turn based game of waiting for nothing to happen. How people can waste their time playing such a mind numbing game is beyond me. Avoid.. The Sid Meier's Civilization series is a classic, hooking you with strategy that will keep you on the edge of your seat. There are many civilizations to choose from that are historically accurate. Many combinations of settings allow you to get a unique experience from the game every time.. Story: 3 out of 10, Graphics: 6 out of 10, Fun: 5 out of 10, Controls: 6 out of 10, Ease to Learn: 5 out of 10, Length: 9 out of 10, Re-play: 5 out of 10, Value: 4 out of 10 Why some people love this game I will never know. I played it and tried to have fun with it but it was far too clunky, unrealistic, pointless, and offered poor overall execution. I have above average intelligence and love strategy games, but this game offered non-sensible choices, poorly timed turn-based formatting, and no real sense of purpose.. This game is very time consuming and can get frustrating at times but overall it is amazing..... It is worth getting defiantly but play other games. P.S. Play on the american revolution mod. Its good. This game has exceeded my expectations after Civ3. I really don't think that this can be beat by almost any game. This is one of those games you can just play over and over and over, and have a completely different experience every time. Honestly, this is a game that would be in almost anyone's top 10.. Still, by far, one of the best games in the series, and one of the best games ever made. Don't play this game if you do not wish to spend hours upon hours conquering the world.. Sorry, went to the wrong game lol and reviewed the wrong game sorry. Can someone perhaps delete my previous **** well! Off to visist the Civ 5 one!. Best game of the series. ............................................. ............................................. .............................................. I can't say I really enjoy strategy games that much. Admittedly, I usually pick them up, and get bored of them really fast. However, I still play them anyway because despite how bored I get of them, I can often see where people who love this genre to death would love these games. That was the case with this game. While I got bored of it and hopped right back into Skyrim, I can totally see where strategy gaming fans will love this game. It truly is a fantastic game. It takes turn-based strategy to whole new levels. There is no real story to this game, however, it does not even need one. The story is really your own. You get to choose your own famous civilization, and set out to conquer the world through one of six victory conditions. You start out in ancient times with only one warrior and settler in most games. However, you will soon progress further to make giant civilizations that will span across the globe. The graphics and sound are also quite good. There is not a lot of detail in the graphics, however, there does not need to be any detail. The graphics are fine just the way they are. You can easily distinguish how everything looks in this game, so detail is not needed. Everything sounds just the way it should too. The game has a beautiful soundtrack, and the units also sound good. The gameplay is also very good. The game works perfectly as a turn-based strategy game. You make your decisions in turns, so you and your opponents (other civilizations) will each get a fair fight as if it were a more complicated game of chess. However, that's not to say the game is too complicated. The truth is, while this game is very advanced, it is simple at the same time. If you are unsure of what to do in the game, you can just set the difficulty level to its lowest setting, and the game will give you help by recommending certain options over others. It's one of those games that is easy to learn, but hard to master. That is probably the best thing about this game's gameplay. However, there is much more to it than that. The decisions you make can positively or negatively effect your civilization over time, and there is an almost limitless amount of decisions you can make in this game. You can form an alliance with other civilizations in hopes of having a peaceful victory in the end, or you can go to war with them to achieve a conquest victory. You can choose which technology your civilization should advance in, what landmarks it should have, what religions it should practice, and much much more. Believe it or not, there is even more to the gameplay than this. The game is also loaded with extra features. It has an encyclopedia, telling about every unit in the game, along with the history of every civilization (and yes, the history is 100% accurate). This makes the game a nice little history lesson. There are also several mods included with the game that change the way the game is played. There are some mods that follow history, such as mods that are made to completely recreate it, or a specific part of it such as World War II. There are also mods that tell a completely different story, such as a war going on between Russians, and mods that have absolutely nothing to do with history, and instead focus on a kind of fantasy. These mods included really change the game for the better. Overall, despite how bored I get of this game, it really is fantastic. I believe that every strategy gamer will love this game, and it is well deserving of a 9 out of 10.. I played it, not bad but certainly not great. I enjoy making colonies but rather dislike how numbers generally determine the battle thanks to the crappy combat system. The pillar of doom is extremely annoying as well.. The best PC game of all time (given you include the expansions), the only drawback here is the game will destroy your productivity. Civ 4 is still the gold standard in 4X strategy; holding up well 7 years after its release.. This is a really decent game. I've ""only"" played civilization 1, 4, and 5 and 1 and 4 were my best experiences. This isn't a review for the other civs, so I will try to limit it to this one. The graphics look better than the screenshots suggest so don't let something like that deter you. What makes this game and civ 1 so great is the level of complexity that goes into your relationships with other countries and your many choices to make during the course of gameplay. Most things you don't like you can turn off. There are only 2 things that bring this game down from a perfect score for me. First, is the %'s that the game tells you that you have of winning a fight. It will say something like 98.9% chance for victory... and you lose more like 1/3 of the time. This makes combat a bit frustrating - you never really know your odds of victory and what you resort to doing is saving before a fight so that you don't have to rely on luck to win. If these percentages were accurate I might choose to live with the consequences, but they aren't. The other downside and perhaps one that is merely opinion - but I feel enough people agree that it's worth mentioning anyway... is that the game is difficult. I play on the lowest difficulty settings and without feeling like a total wimp (for example giving myself more allies than the enemy has) I usually don't win. I don't play with barbarians anymore, but when I did having them around made the game MUCH more difficult. You can turn them off but it's something to be aware of. The first flaw is the only one that feels like a major pain though.. win or lose I still have quite a bit of fun playing.. The best turn based strategy ever (in my opinion), better even than any of the empire earth games! A great game that keeps me entertained to this day.. This is the most refined and complex Civ iteration to date. Be prepared for some serious empire management, as religion and health provide some new challenges in your path to world domination. Enemy AI is, as always, really clever and its ruthlessness will make you think again before declaring war on someone. The game rewards a skillful diplomacy more than ever before, as allies now are a help more than a **** nuisance. Graphics are not the best, but they look cool anyway. Absolutely recommended.-. Actually the best installment of the series. With improvements over earlier titles and not being dumbed down as V, it stands solid and on the pedestal of strategic gaming. Better graphics, improved diplomacy, governments and religion, strategic resources plus goodies... And modding. Such power of modding that has never been seen before in Civilization series. I have honestly played this game for so many hours, and tried so many mods that I can't give it less than a perfect score. It would be unjust.. Review includes both expansion packs. This and Master of Orion 2 are the best 2 strategy games I have ever played and everything else I compare to them.. Strategy gaming at it's finest. People may argue that the graphical development has taken precedence over gameplay in Civ 4 (the culture system a bit hit and miss, and the end game can end up a bit of a quagmire) but for me the game play is still exceptionally addictive. If you enjoy games that make you think before you act, Civ 4 is for you.. Civilization IV is a mediocre game at best... Diplomacy is average, combat is easily manipulated with huge STACKS OF DOOM, and micromanagement is rife in the cities... Honestly, the best thing about this game is the Rhye's and Fall of Civilization scenario that comes with Civ IV: BTS.. This game's genre is not my kind of thing, but I have to give it props for having the most meticulously balanced design and variety of paths to victory. The definitive turn-based strategy game of all time, and will continue to be considering the dismal failure that was V.. This game is simply incredible I have played it often since I got it over a year ago if you have even the slightest interest in this kind of thing it is a must buy.. The best Civilization game of them all. If you can only play one of them, this is it! Note that this review was written AFTER Civilization V has been out for quite a while already. Yes IV is that good.. to all those who gave it less than 5-6 , the features are perfect u need to bring yourself up instead of sticking up with old features. and for those who cannot tolerate the game's slowness at least don't give bad ratings to ruin the games overall rating and mislead **** nearly the best non-fight game out there.. A revolutionary game for its time, Civ IV is still good nearly 7 years later. By far a better game than Civ V, IV is complex and engaging with more to learn every time you play. If you buy this game, there is a strong chance you will become obsessed and spend hours on end playing. So long as you have the time, Civ IV is much more worthwhile than many of the newer, more expensive games out now.. The most moddable Civ game out there, if you're a coder. The last game distributed in a 'free' way (not forced to use steam, only DRM crap is the copy protection on the CD/DVD) and where the mods are also independently distributable. Lots more features and some eyecandy too. The last good Civilization game.. Awesome game. One of the best Civs. If your trying to decide between this one and Civ 5 get this one Civ 5's a dumbed down peace of **** Also Ian277 is a ****.. One of the best strategy games ever. The realistic and a little complex gameplay makes this game a masterpiece. The music is awesome, the graphics is acceptable and it has a great technology tree as well. I only don't like the limited rounds.. This game never gets old. It is now six years since the game came out and I am still playing. This is one of those games that beats its successor. Civ V cannot stand up to this game. This game has the right amount of complexity to keep it interesting.. This game... average at best. Turn-based strategy has never been my favorite, but this game makes it monotonous. The higher levels are ridiculously difficult, and doing the same exact thing over and over is exactly as it sounds: repetitive and boring. Every once in a while I find myself enjoying it, but I can't play it for too much at a time before my eyes start to slip shut.. Simple the best Civ in the entire series, and if Civ 5 is any clue, its also going to be the pinnacle of the series since the new one is completely awful, oh well at least this one has re-play ability similar to SMAC.. It's just not enough to justify buying it. After I spent $40 on it, I played ONE game and was already bored. It's not that it's a bad game, but I found it a bit less fun and a bit more tedious than Civ III, so I just went back to playing Civ III.. Great game. Other than some issues with the ATI card I had at the time, I've thoroughly enjoyed this game. Definitely the high water mark of the series.. I played this and and found the opening credits annoying. then i set up a game and there was no scenario maps! i started the game and played. the religeon aspect didn't impress me. i soon found the combat system has gotten worse. the nicely simpley animated wariors are gone they tried to make it look real but it looks worse. the game is a disapointment. all the people that have played the recent civ's i know don't like this game. only new players like it. and that's because they dont know civ. disapointed. i am very mad that it has a better rating than 5, since 5 is great. i have played civ three for at least 1000 hrs. no im not lying. played from age 7 - 14 and i am still play off and on. this gets a F- as a grade dont be fooled by the overrated cliques. this is not CIV.. My previous experience with this type of game was Age of Empire II, so maybe that gives me a bias. That game felt more fast-paced and fun. Civilization IV is as much fun as reading an encyclopedia: I may enjoy some interesting moments, but it's mostly just wading through details. This seems like a game that might be more enjoyable if you invest the time to learn how to play, but that's not the experience I'm looking for and my review is reflecting that. If you expect to get in and immediately start having fun, with maybe a in game tutorial to teach you as you go, you're in for a disappointment. If you do want to learn the game and you really enjoy having a ton of control over your empire (the negative way of saying that: ""micromanaging""), then you'll be rewarded I'm sure. They could have done much better with the nation's leaders. When Ghandi himself is constantly threatening to commit genocide on my people if I don't give him some iron, something has gone horribly wrong.. If you do not want to lose hours of your day without noticing... DO NOT get this game, but if you don't mind playing marathon sessions and being totally obsessed with conquering the world then this is the right game for you!. By far the best Civ game. Everything, from the military aspect to managing your cities, feel so balanced. In addition, there are plenty of ways to win a battle. Every game truly feels different.","Civ4 gives a sizable roster of buildings and units, many of which have their own nice . the game is made even better by mods, with mods like Rye's and many many others . overall rating: 9.2 ."
850.Pac-Man Championship Edition DX +,"This is the greatest edition of pac-man to date. Pac-man perfection has been reached.. One Minute Review: Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ (2013) PAC-MAN DX+ is a maze runner high score chaser, originally released on consoles in 2010, and later on PC and Mobile devices - The DX+ version released in 2013, offering DLC with extra maps and skins,and rendering previous versions of the title obsolete.This game focuses on speed and precision, as you try to rack up points, beat the clock, and munch the most ghosts possible - depending on game mode. The player is given bombs to knock away ghosts and a very generous ""slow down"" system when you're about to be eaten, allowing you to keep the action going. The presentation is great, and there's customization options to keep things **** nitpicks don't invovle the gameplay: the interface is a bit clunky by today's standards, and for a high score chaser, the leaderboards are loaded with fake scores, which is always frustrating. It's a fun arcade game with solid mechanics and plenty of that ""one more run"" addictiveness - serious Pac Fans will love it, casuals may find it a little repetitive after a couple hours - regardless, you'll get your monies worth.. A fine reimagining, but still doesn't do enough to really be a must-play for everyone.. I love this game. It takes Pac-Man, a really good but slightly aged concept, and throws some amazing stuff into it. Dig Dug used to be my favorite high score game, but this definitely beats it out. Everything in this game is just so satisfying. Besides the music. Y'all need better music.. A decent PAC-Man game, but the vivid and vibrant colors don’t compare to the original, not to mention how much easier this version is.. This is one way to revitalize a franchise. A lot of fun in the most simplest of forms.. A lazy, over-glorified expansion pack. Even after all these years, I never understood the hype behind this game compared to the likes of Pac-Mania and Pac-Man Arrangement. It's linear up the ass and forces you down scripted hallways due to how the trains and sleeping ghosts work, and gobbling up trains is only fun for a few minutes before it becomes boring. Honestly, I had more fun playing New Super Mario Bros. 2, Another sequel I deem lazy and uninspired. But at least that game had content, This game is just lacking and is not worth my time. I am astoundingly disappointed.. Remember the old Pac-Man arcade machines back in the 80s? This is it on steroids. I am seriously blown away from how they improved the classic we all know and love. The presentation is amazing. It vastly improves from the original Pac-Man Championship Edition. The graphics are very colorful, and there are many skins you can use to customize your game. The sprites of Pac-Man and the many ghosts in the game are very detailed and resemble their 8-bit counterparts. The soundtrack is phenomenal. Not only do you have the original Pac-Man Championship Edition game, you have several other tracks as well, and they all kick butt. The game allows you to choose from a variety of game modes and mazes. Game modes can vary from getting the most points to eating the most ghosts in a row. You can choose from 3 difficulties, easy, medium, and hard. How fast the game goes, the number of lives, and the number of bombs you get depend on your difficulty level. When you start the game, Pac-Man goes at the speed you set at the beginning, but as you eat more pac-dots and ghosts, the speed gradually increases until Pac-Man achieves speeds that make Sonic the Hedgehog jealous (What has SEGA done to him?). Unlike the original Pac-Man Championship Edition, this game has lots of ghosts scattered around the maze. When you get close to them, they will start following you from behind. Don't turn back whatever you do or else these colorful jerks will kill you. The main source of progression in the game is fruit. As you know, fruit comes in different forms and increase in point value. When you eat them, they will add new pac-dots to the maze, and the maze will change forms. This is a good way of keeping a time limited game going. The power ups are awesome. Once again, the power pellet returns. As you might know, you can use power pellets to turn ghosts dark blue and eat them. It's really satisfying when you get one of these and eat all 30 to 40 ghosts behind you. That's awesome. New to this game are bombs, and let me just say I am glad that bombs are in this game. In a really bad situation—such as getting trapped in a corner by ghosts—the game will go into a slo-mo effect and allow Pac-Man time to react and use a bomb. When you use a bomb, all the ghosts that are chasing you will be blasted back into the ghost box, allowing you time to get out of a tough situation. When the game gets fast, you will need these. Stock up on them and use them wisely. I cannot stress enough how great Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is. It is one of the best games I played on the Xbox 360. The graphics and sountrack are very amazing, and the gameplay is a major improvement from the original arcade game. If you haven't bought this game yet on the Xbox Live Arcade, now's the time since we're about a year away from end of Live support for Xbox 360. I give this game a 10 out of 10. 10/10 (Legendary!) •The Good + Colorful Graphics + Lots of Ghosts + Kick-butt soundtrack + Bombs + Intense Gameplay The Bad - N/A. Updating the classic Pac-Man formula this Championship Addition adds score and time attack modes to make for an addictive Xbox Live title.. Namco have added so much more since the original Championship Edition. It's not strategic in terms of avoiding ghosts any more. The game is a lot easier due to the addition of bombs, dumb ghosts who will just follow you rather than trying to catch you out and the slow-mo when you're about to lose a life. And yet it's way more fun. By not letting players abuse ghost combos without advancing the maze, Namco have made a game that is rewarding and is much more about efficiency in terms of eating the dots as quickly as possible- as well as careful timing for ghost combos. The addition of new mazes, time trial and ghost combo modes give the player lots more choice, and hours of fun.. This game is addictive, it's deep, beautiful visually, and it thrives on design, rather than fluffy bullet point features which is a common selling point of mainstream juggernaut franchises. It's not about checking a sequel out and now you have RACE CAR KILLSTREAK or now you have JETPACKS. It's just something you play, and the gameplay speaks for itself. That is something of real, true high quality, and well-crafted game design.. Yeah I'm an old school gamer. Yeah I love Pac-Man & Mr. Do! But this is more like Pac-Man does Trials HD, it just has that addictive ""one more go"" quality. And it was the first game I went out off my way to 100% complete. Worth the 800 M$ no questions, although if you go back to it after 100% completing is another matter. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is the best downloadable game of the year, as well as the best Pac-Man to date. Pros: 'Addictive' doesn't even do it justice; gorgeous visuals; lots of modes, boards, and more importantly, ghosts. Cons: You'll never be the best.. 10/10 = Masterpiece = Can anyone spell ""addiction""? I know I can! Great retro throwback, and the most addictive game of 2010!!. This game is pretty fun, and the leaderboards are engaging, and it's cheap. The game lets you pick your favorite graphhics styles (classic, modern, or some just a tad weird but in a cool way), sound track, and there's somewhere around 8 maps to play on each with it's own pathing and 15 or so time trials. The formula is still pac-man but has a nice modern feeling with the responsive controls and an awesome slow-mo feature when your near a ghost and a gradually increasing speed, so all that is gold. There's just one major flaw that undermines all the afore-mentioned praise, which is this: it's still pac-man. It's not new, it's not original, it's nothing you haven't seen before, nothing that's gonna keep your interest through all 8 levels because it's just more of the same pac-man with a few added features. Just because the game has modern features doesn't mean it can compete with modern arcade titles; but hey, for the money, it's a pretty good buy if you're looking for a change of pace from the plethora of steroid spraying shooters out there.. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is definitely a fun turn on the traditional Pac-Man games, but I found it to be a bit over-priced. If you are a Pac-Fan, then by all means... download. The graphics are nice, sound and music are more modern (and not annoying), and gameplay blends old and new together quite nicely. And the developers added one feature that will always be a favorite: Matrix-style slow down right before colliding with enemies.. I never believed Pac-Man could be so fun... I often buy Pac-mans in different platforms (especially portable ones) because Pacman is a Must have in any console; since I already had original Pac-Man in my xbox, i thought there was no reason to buy Pacman CE DX; I was wrong. I played the trial and I felt in love with it. It is totally different from original pacman, having the focus on speed, and eating ghosts... It gives you a lot of tools for surviving the ghosts, but it is challenging (a little bit) at the same time. Moreover, it has a lot of puzzles... If you have a chance, buy it... Seriously... (If you have a psp, I think it is available for it, so that is the best choice, if not, go 360). dont see the big deal about this. its pacman for christ sake!! cant believe its also been rated higher than dead space 2, call of duty black ops!!?? good price but not worth the score it got.. Really fun and addicting only thing its missing is co-op or multiplayer it seems interesting... The graphics are great too... Best played when really bored i played this non stop fir like 3 hours straight. Simply outstanding. It's got the old school 80's gaming mechanics, the insane high speed action of current arcade games, and the rainbow euphoria of Peggle all wrapped up into one package. Great for short bursts of gaming or longer periods of trying to get the new high score. It is addicting and just plain FUN.. The best $10 you could ever spend. This game will drain hours and hours of your life if you are not careful! It's simply a must buy for anyone remotely interested in Pac-Man.. Easily the most enjoyable adaptation of Pac-Man I have ever played. It feels great to play and will leave you coming back for better high scores time and time again. A must own game. excelent game, its one of the best pacman i ever played :). I thoroughly enjoyed Champion Edition when it came out and still play it to this day. DX took it to a whole new level for me. The options available for game play make every play through entertaining. A must have for any Pac-man enthusiast.. As one of those that could never get into the original Pac Man (read: **** at), I've never been bitten by the nostalgia bug for this franchise's more recent iterations. It's too difficult for me and my aging reflexes and I'll be the first to admit it. I've never come across an entry in this franchise that I could play for longer then a minute. That is... until DX came along. A brilliant take on the classic formula which breathes new life, accessibility and replayability into this 30 year old gaming icon. Fantastic stuff.. i love this i couldn't play regular cause as the game went on the ghosts got faster, but now with the slow-mo im a pro and i love seeing all the points flash on the screen. i cant find anything wrong with this game.. Unbelievably addicting. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX will have you playing 'till the wee hours of the morning. From the variations of music, colors, characters and mazes to the highly competitive formula, you won't be able to tear yourself away. Pure adrenaline-pumping fun.. This game is proof positive that game developers' time and effort is better spent on exploring new gameplay mechanics than on striving for photorealistic images and Hollywood-style cinematics. The developers at Namco, instead of asking themselves how to make Pac-Man look and sound better, poured their energy into figuring out how to make the game more fun. This isn't just a modernized or tweaked version of the old arcade game - it is a completely new game, created specifically for networked home gaming consoles. It tosses aside the old notion that a game's objective needs to be about survival and focuses entirely on competitive scoring. Reviewers who complained about the near-colision slowdown and bombs must not have really thought it through, because those elements provide a complexity to the playing stretegy that is absolutely essential. Without them, there'd be a 1,000-way tie for best score on all the lederboards. This is a masterpiece of gaming design.. OK so you have Pac-Man. Now you have this Pac-Man. This IS Pac-Man. I am amazed how they could improve the formula. This game is addicting. It's fast paced and there is nothing more satisfying then eating a train of 30 ghosts and wiping out the rest as you keep extending the power pill time. I even enjoy the Matrix time effect whenever you are close to getting nailed by a ghost. I can't think of any negatives.. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX just does what a game should do : it's fun to play and play again, it doesn't break too much away from the mold that made it an instant classic back when it originally released and adds a few variations here and there along with leader boards to give it replayability. Forget spending quarters over and over; for 10$, you'll be able to play this gem **** without fear of running out of change. If you're still skeptical, download the trial and let the game show you what gaming is about : pure, unadulterated fun.. This is one if not the best arcade games on XBLA. its fast, fun,colorful, and the music's great. Once you eat 40 ghosts in a row you will know why your still living.. When Namco released Championship Edition a couple years ago, I was completely blown away. Somehow, they've done it again. They've beefed up the gameplay yet again, this time adding more modes than you should get for $10. This game is awesome. Go get the trial!","PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ is a maze runner high score chaser, originally released on consoles in 2010 . the player is given bombs to knock away ghosts, and a generous ""slow down"" system when you're about to be eaten, allowing you to keep the action going . besides the music, y'all need better music ."
851.Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection,"I love Uncharted Drakes Fortune,this game thats Amazing, because the history, The gameplay, And more, The ending that ok, But ALL off this game is good. A great action adventure trilogy. While the first game might be kind of outdated, its sequels are significantly better in every way. In my opinion, all the games are fun to play, they have very entertaining characters and fun puzzles. 2 is usually considered to be the best, and I agree, 3 is very good too, and 1 is decent, maybe a little bit frustrating to play sometimes, but still worth checking. Fun trilogy, a must-play for PlayStation players. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10.. A simple reboot of the first 3 uncharted games, the graphic are the same what is ok. The games are the same like on the ps3 you can change the steering to old in the settings for nostalgic people. Apart from that there is a new Difficulty ""Brutal"" what's pretty nice. Ah yes, the modern-day Indiana Jones of gaming as many call it. Some people even call it modern day Tomb Raider which is kinda true too. Anyway, there are the first 3 games in this collection (Drake's Fortune, Among Thieves, & Drake's Deception) that all are pretty consistent for the most part. Your favorite adventure will mostly be based on personal opinion of its execution. The first game is more puzzle solving and less action based. The second one is extremely action based and has a lot less puzzles. The third game is the most balanced game. So it just depends on what you enjoy more. Personally, I enjoyed the second game the most due to its excellent adventure with less puzzles holding back the experience. Either way, you'll like all 3 games and are the best adventure games I've ever played bar none.. Overall a great game collection. Good story and goated protagonists. Villains are extraordinary as well and the action is cool. At the end of the games it's always a bit scary (except for part 3). Great gameplay and mechanics but the first part didn't age quiet well and some parts were too hard.. The game is incredibly annoying and not particularly innovative. If you don't follow the path set out by the developers and are lucky with the QuickTime events, you will die more often than in a Souls Like game. All three Parts are nearly the same.. Enjoyable games with descent story and characters. Another all time classic that anybody should give it a try.. If I have to rate the trilogy i must give it 8. Fun gameplay, Nate is one hell of a character, of course it has it's difects but overall it's a must. Pros - fantastic characters and dialogue - great location variety - higher difficulties feel actually good to play - combat is simple yet fun - the spectacle sections are always exhilarating // Cons - cover mechanics are janky enough to cause unnecessary deaths - all final boss fights are unbearably mid - Drake's Fortune aged poorly when it comes to the amount of combat compared to character moments // The three game collection of Uncharted is incredible. While the first game is leagues below the second and the third, it is still a good enough experience to warrant its place on the collection. What shocks me the most is the character writing. Nathan, Sully, Elena, Chloe and Charlie are all great characters that are never annoying to listen to. It is shocking to me just how good their interactions actually are. The dialogue is snappy and often funny, there is solid chemistry where there needs to be and it is all supported with animations that are far too character appropriate for their time. Beating all the games on Crushing also gave me a good amount of appreciation for the combat in the series. Where in the beginning it felt like I was getting my teeth kicked in every encounter, by the time I rolled credits on the third game, I left with a plethora of strategies on how to deal with every single encounter. Where the three games shine is in the location variety. Deep jungle, toombs, castles, underground railway, ship graveyard and more. These locations are often accompanied by breathtaking spectacles where the previously mentioned locations fall apart around you. My two biggest gripes are the cover mechanics and boss fights. Going into cover works well 80% of the time. In the remaining 20%, you try to change from cover to cover, perform a half baked roll, Nathan stands up and you get lasered down by the enemies. Especially on the higher difficulties. All the final boss fights are nothing to write home about. In Uncharted 2 they managed to cobble together something not terrible but not good either. Uncharted 1 is just kill fodder until you kill the main boss in a QTE sequence. And Uncharted 3 has the longest and most boring QTE bossfight in the series. Overall, I am stunned at how well written the main cast of these games are. The main story is always an interesting delve into mythical treasure that I enjoy a lot. I feel like any fan of the old Indiana Jones movies will have a field day with this series.. I'm a fan of my favorite game series, it's very good, it's beyond amazing. NATHAN DRAKE BEST CHARACTER İN WORLD!!!. Amazing Value for the Price. It's incredible how well these four games hold up to this day!. I get the appeal, but I was told these were supposed to be fun. Repetitive hordes of bullet sponge enemies and hand holding parkour sections are not fun.. The gunplay is terrible and the gameplay loop is boring. Climb, dialogue, shoot, repeat. Why are there so many enemies??!! You kill like hundreds and hundreds it gets boring after the first hour. This remastered collection of the ""Uncharted"" trilogy is superb. While it doesn't include online multiplayer, the games have been optimized for the PS4. They have enhanced visuals, a resolution of 1080p and run at 60 fps. New features include Arcade and Photo modes. If you've never played the Nathan Drake adventures on PS3 before, then grab this. Overall, I would rate it with a 9 out of 10.. A nice compilation which allowed me to better understand the status of this licence in the videogame world. An appreciable work though the games suffers the clumsiness of their age, and it's normal considering their same age. A nice mix of Tomb Raider and Gears of War, and great staging starting from the 2nd opus.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Pure perfection. Indiana Jones mixed with TPS elements is just awesome! Uncharted without a doubt is my favorite Ps-exclusive franchise. All 3 games maintain the excitement and the great characters. The games have so many memorable moments, the opening of the second game is my personal favorite. If you have some kind of a Playstation console, you have to play this collection.. Worth buying SONY console. One of the best adventure series ever created (along with Thomb Raider). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Collection of three parts of the Uncharted series. Personally, I had the most fun in the second part and I would judge it the best. This does not change the fact that the whole series is a must-play and it is worth knowing the story.. An amazing game series. I never played one of this games I and must say. They look great for remasters of PS3 era. Remasters are good, I don't have any problems and worth it.. bro they literally combined absolute fire into one destination. One of the greatest features of Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection is the way in which it combines the best mechanics of the three original games in the series. Each game in the collection offers a variety of gameplay situations, from intense gunfights to climbing sequences and clever puzzles. The fluidity of the combat and climbing mechanics is remarkable, and the smooth transition between these elements keeps the action exciting and immersive. Gameplay is refined and improved over exclusive games, providing a more polished and accessible experience for modern gamers. The updated graphics for PlayStation 4 are one of the most notable aspects of the collection. The original Uncharted games were already impressive in their respective release times, but the remaster does an exceptional job of bringing these worlds to life in an even more stunning way. The visuals are sharp, detailed, and feature incredible attention to detail, from the exotic landscapes to the character's facial expressions. The transition to the new generation of hardware allows gamers to enjoy a visual experience that rivals many of the latest releases. Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection captures and amplifies all the beauty of the original games in the series. Players can explore stunning settings, from tropical forests to ancient cities, and each environment is richly rendered to create a compelling and immersive atmosphere.. Engaging story and fascinating characters. Puzzles were fun as well.. If you've experienced the originals, it's not worth it (except for the first one, which is somewhat more balanced, but the overall game quality hasn't improved significantly here). If you haven't, it provides decent enjoyment but isn't exceptional.. One of the most overrated games on playstation. A plot that is based on clichés and stereotyped characters. Advise against. A perfect remaster of 3 amazing games with improved graphics and performance. Uncharted 2 is the best. Uncharted 1 has been significantly improved in terms of graphics. Uncharted 3 is also great. The best type of action game you could hope for.. These Uncharted games have been worshipped ever since their release but I never really got around to playing them until now. And wow, I really wish I had continued never having played these games. These were absolutely praised solely on the fact that they were PS3 exclusives and it was during the height of the stupid ‘console wars’. Because nothing about these games is stand-out, they don’t set the bar for anything. Everything they copy was done better in its original game or movie. In fact, The Uncharted series is probably hurt the most from the fact that it never has its own identity. Every game stole from other games (Tomb Raider. Prince of Persia, Assassin’s Creed, Splinter Cell, etc) and movies (Indiana Jones, The Mummy, etc) and thus never managed to pull off any of their aspects better than the original source material. It’s so much fun to climb buildings and other things in AC because you get to choose where to go. Here, there’s one set path and if you don’t take it, you fail. I don’t understand how people say they stick around for the characters. What characters?? No one in this series ever grows, ever changes. Nate makes the exact same mistakes every single time. I should have started a tally of how many times the bad guy got the drop on him and ordered him to ‘drop your weapon’. Elena is straight up unlikeable without any substance to her character. She could have had in the first game, but then they started tweaking her job with each subsequent game and the outlandish ways she kept popping up in the adventure. And don’t get me started on her and Nate’s ‘romance’, oh yes there was so much love between two people who didn’t even know each other. Sully is barely in the games and his character completely changed from the first game. I can’t understand why people say he’s the best character in the series: an old, cigar-toting, money-spending, womanizer who wants to get rich? I don’t understand Nate at all. It never says anything about him possibly being an archaeologist and it certainly never mentions how he gets the money to fund his little expeditions (especially since he never succeeds to get any treasure). But hey he’s the best at finding these places and somehow is the best climber, jumper ever known to man. There’s only so long I can suspend my disbelief. Each story is the same. Nate learns of possible lost city with a fortune of treasure. Nate must go to several cities and solve many puzzles while bad guys easily follow behind him/beat him there. Suddenly fortune is bad, will end the world, oh no Nate must now be a hero and save the world. City is destroyed, no treasure, but oh we all had fun didn’t we? The combat is some of the worst. Each game puts in a stealth option but it was never made to work. Not to mention the enemy will start shooting at you if they see your AI buddies that you have no control over. The first game never tries for stealth, two begins the ‘stealth’, and three gives you idiotic AI to try and make stealth, otherwise you’d never be able to take people down quietly. And people worship the ground at Naughty Dog’s feet? Have they never played an actual GOOD game?? I can in no way recommend these games. A great story and fun gameplay is what keeps people coming back, what gives it replayability. This series has none of that. 2: Among Thieves > Drake’s Fortune > 3: Drake’s Deception > 4: A Thief’s End. This game is really beautiful. It has both a beautiful gameplay and a beautiful story. I liked Uncharted 2 more, and then I liked Uncharted 3, and then Uncharted 1. The remaster of this game is really great, but in the final fight of Uncharted 3 against Talbot, there was a technical problem (glitch) that Due to that, Talbot became invincible and really annoying, and I guess that this problem arose in this remake and when it was transferred from PS3 to PS4. I stayed in that fight for 3 days because there was no way to beat Talbot and I was constantly looking for a weak point and in short I beat Talbot on the third day. I mean, a fight that should have lasted half an hour ended up taking three days, and I wish Bluepoint would fix that problem with an update after identifying this glitch. But the Uncharted trilogy (along with Uncharted 4) are really interesting game series, and the Uncharted trilogy really needs a remake like The last of us 1, and I hope Naughty Dog will do it.. an actual & beautiful remake for best trilogy in Indiana Jones or adventure type of games. For me the second game is easily the best in series. Uncharted 2 is just so good and one of best sequels you ever seen.. Fun game like action movie. 9/10 gameplay 10/10 graphics 9/10 story 9/10 environments. Solid experience except the third one. It has inconsistent difficulty spike what can make from breezing game to super hard level, even on normal difficulty.. Awesome collection of games. Played through it once, going again with higher difficulty.. I absolutely loved all three games! Story is amazing with cool places to visit, discover and climb. The only bad thing would be that its so heavily scripted that sometimes you will just die bunch of times because you literally don´t know how to trigger the cutscene to proceed further.... Compilation of the PS3 trilogy with a bit of spit and polish. Classic adventuring with good storylines and voice acting, interesting puzzles and nice visuals.. A pretty nice collection of amazing games that has a perfect price. The remasters all well done and they run perfectly on the ps4.. After finishing all three games, I can say that my experience was mixed - and ended negatively in the last game. Since I already wrote about each one of them separately, I only will judge this collection by its technical matters. Saying that... it's bad. Gameplay-wise, the decision of locking the sensitivity was too much for me. One of the worst ideas someone can have in a shooter game. Especially when it's hard like uncharted - in higher difficulties. They could enhance the AI and make the encounters less linear. The difficulty just seems purely artificial and the overall gameplay can be described as ""outdated"". This is why Halo CE gameplay is amazing after 20 years and Uncharted 1, 2, and 3 are not (at least for shooter enjoyers). If you want a movie, sure, it will be playable. And in that matter, any movie with this script would be mediocre. Graphic-wise, it could be better. I mean... a lot. It's improved, alright, but seems effortless since playing an old game on a modern PC with (or without) mods will look way better than an official remaster. Since this collection fails in simple concepts a remaster should do pretty well, like... make things actually better if needed, this deserves an L.. ""Never a dull moment""- from the first to the last frame. The story was top-notch with lots of creative and interesting dialogues, moments, and improvisations from the main character, Nathan. The first game may have frustrated me at times, but the second and third games were simply fantastic. The games had many impressive cinematic moments, not just in the cutscenes but also during the gameplay itself. such as jumping off crumbling ground. there were some really scary enemies as well. i would definitely recommend this game, if you want some Adrenaline.. Uncharted is THE classic of adventure / action games with a lot of gunfight and jumping puzzles taking place in beautiful and exotic landscapes. The story is engaging and thrilling, characters are colourful and unique, the dialogue and humor make for an amazing Indiana Jones experience.. A quick summary of the three games included with this entry: Uncharted 1: Absolutely boring and generic third person shooter. Could have been saved if it had been a little more campy but it didn't embrace it's camp factor enough to be endearing. Uncharted 2: Shooting and movement get a huge improvement, but I have similar issues with the games story. The small hints of camp were not enough to save the story from being completely forgettable. If it weren't for the improvements in gameplay, I feel safe saying the series would have imploded. Uncharted 3: Genuinely great shooting and movement, finally feel like saying one of these games is worth playing because of it. The story does not fare any better than the first two, but at this point I'm not really expecting anything interesting to emerge from the soup of cliches and contrivances that this story is built out of.. If you played the originals, not worth it (except for the first one, which is more balanced, but the game wasn´t that good and it isn´t much better here). If you haven´t, it´s good fun, but nothing crazy.. This collection is a must have for every play station user, even if you the original games. The best remastered collection ever made.. A great package of legendary 3 games combined. the first game **** today, the animations of the second game are very impressive even today, those action scenes of the third game are legend legend legend. A good game, Nathan is a charismatic character, the Gameplay is typical, and well it's a 3x1. First time playing Uncharted series and I loved it. Last a few hours of the first game, I've got really plot twisted. Good story, good combat mechanics. After AC games, really good platforming.. Uncharted is one of my favourite series, Uncharted 2 is a game will be forever in my heart, it's a must play for all PlayStation users.. + stories of uncharted 2 & 3 are great + set pieces of especially 3 are really good - uncharted 1 kind of a slog to get through - combat not super enjoyable. REAL SCORE 8.8. This is one of the most iconic and better sagas of all time. So much fun playing it, great adventures, good stories with amazing characters that make you feel in company and make you feel emphatise with them. A masterpieces from the PS3 era now playable in PS4. Now my dad actually had Uncharted for the PS3 and I watched him play a lot and after I watched the Uncharted movie I realized we had Uncharted 4 after I played it and beat I got this collection last year and it was heat not only are the graphics better but I felt like I was Nathan Drake. The Original trilogy remastered is the best thing I could ask for.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Nice set of the classic games. Perhaps I expected much more from the stories, plot and gameplay. Sure thing, it's been a while since the release of the games. Perhaps at one time it was the peak of what an action adventure can show. Now we have a beautiful picture, commendable game design, mediocre shooting and only in some places a fascinating plot and story. When you play these games, you feel regret that you didn't have the opportunity to play them 5-10 years ago. Then, perhaps, you would be completely delighted. As for now, it's a good games, worse trying, but just like many films of the past, are honorable, but far from being so exciting and impressive now.. Only played first 2 fully and i'm playing the third part right now but oh wow. i'm sad i did not meet this series sooner it's truly amazing. the story in the later parts comes together so well. Nathan Drake is a really cool character will look forward to continue the journey with him in the last 2 parts which i have left to play.. Great port for PS4 players who still want to play the other games on their current console.. You have 3 amazing videogames in one disc. What else could you ask for?????. A decent remastered if you haven't played these 3 all time great games. if you did play them I don't recommend buying it again unless you don't have access to your Ps3.. Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s more rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions. (8)Very Good. Innovative, but perhaps not the right choice for everyone. This score indicates that there are many good things to be had, but arguably so. I went through Uncharted 1-3 before the release of Uncharted 4 all at once and glad I did because it helped me appreciate the Character building between the characters. If I hadn’t played through the old games, I don’t think I would have enjoyed Uncharted 4 as much as I did. These are solid games but I don’t think they deserve as much praise as they got. If this was more story, exploration, and puzzle focused it would have been better. Just the endless waves of enemies made it dull and makes it kind of unbelievable. You’re just competing to find the treasure from another group of treasure hunters with money. Set-pieces and were innovated ideas at the time.. This bundle is great for persons who haven't played Uncharted series on PlayStation 3. These games are not only one of the best games of adventure genre, but one also of the best exclusive games for Sony.. After 7 years when this Remaster came out I am logging in again on the PS5 now – I skip part 1 as this is then really not up to date anymore, but still this series is adventure/action and great acting. It does it better in some scenes than new games! So I started again with Part 2, after seeing it again after several years, the only minus I can give is to the big shootings, there part 4 did it better and reduced the tempo of the game. Part 2, especially the ending is just one shooting area to the next one which is quite annoying sometimes. But still, I like all the characters, all the sceneries I visit. In my opinion it is time for a PS5 remaster (some games just really deserve to being kept alive by newer versions, like Tlou1 now) when they advertise Uncharted 5 officially ;) looking forward jumping in part 3 again soon and then finish again part4. Great series!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I truly wish they would release first three games on PC. Why would they release 4th one, if most PC players have never played first three? 1 was kind of meh, but 2 and 3 were amazing. I played 2 with PS3 emulator with keyboard and mouse and it works perfectly. I don't understand why they wont release official PC version of 2 and 3, so i wouldn't have to use emulator. They would make so much money.. Hello, I give it a rating of 9 out of 10 because the games are really good, plus for the price of 30.00 dollars (approximately) it is a bargain. The expanded trophy collection and ""Brutal"" mode makes the game entertaining for several hours. I have played all three games more than 2 times each and it doesn't feel boring, each one has its essence and they are replayable. For people looking for an opinion on whether to buy the game, yes, the collection is very good, but the final decision is up to you if you decide to buy it.. NAUGHTY DOG is taking firm steps towards becoming the best company of today and in the future, this game is just as perfect as other games.. Definitely worth the money. Three classics full of adventure and adrenalin.. As someone who hasn't played any uncharted games before this, I was surprised at how much I liked them. Uncharted 1 is rough around the edges but is still a solid start to the franchise. Uncharted 2 improves on everything in the first uncharted and is one of my favorite video games. Uncharted 3, although not as strong as the second game, is still a great time and worth your time. 3 good games for the price of one is always a good deal and this collection is a great way to begin your uncharted journey. Also Uncharted 1 is a 6/10, Uncharted 2 is a 10/10, and Uncharted 3 is a 7/10. Can't wait to play Uncharted 4.. I have never played a uncharted game before this but now I can understand why everyone loves uncharted (not like Nintendo were the fan's want to **** of the CEO with meh to bad games) Amazing graphics , amazing story, amazing gameplay my only nit pick is that you can't go back to the main menu but aside from that it's a must play 10/10. I played these games about 4 years ago on my ps3. I have now played them again on my ps4 and although there is nothing like playing a game for the first time I had the same feelings for each game than when I first played them. My rates for these game are the same than on my first playthrough: first part a 7; second part between 9 and 10 and the third game a 9. It took me almost 22 hours on easy mode (Uncharted 1: almost 7 hours, Uncharted 2: almost 9 and Uncharted 3 a bit more than 7). Yes, I do still recommend them. Especially the last two games. If you liked these games you must play Uncharted 4 too. Great games!. The only reason I didn’t give this is a 10 is for graphics. They don’t look like next-gen game, and that’s okay. The uncharted games speak for themselves with gameplay that is almost second to none. Some of the puzzles in #3 were unnecessarily hard and counter/intuitive, but other than those small issues there is no better trilogy in modern gaming. Having heard of the Uncharted Games in the past, I'm so glad my local library had this available. I was able to play all three games and enjoyed them to my hearts content. Each game got better as I played and 100% recommend it to anyone looking to buy.. 3 games for the price of one. All of these are beautifully remastered with little to no gameplay performance issues.. If you didn't have the privilege of playing Uncharted 1 - 3 on the Playstation 3, then this is the collection for you. Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection collects ALL THREE of the original trilogy for your convenience and currently goes for the low price of about ten bucks. Yep -- you can get hundreds of hours of Nathan Drake, Sully, Elena and the rest of the gang, along with plenty of shooting, engaging twistin' n' turnin' story, treasure hunting and fun for about TEN BUCKS! Stop sitting around reading reviews and BUY THIS COLLECTION! ADVENTURES AWAIT YOU!. this is a great collection; the best game is the second one, overall sony delivers with this collection made me look into other ones, another hit for PlayStation 4.. i played whole Uncharted games on ps3 and ps4 and wheter you belive it or not i am playing drakes collection in ps5 right now uncharted games are in my top list of all time i laughed i cried i literly lived with this game and thank u naughty dog for this amazing game the story telling is perfect, you never get tired and you always want to know what gappena next, graphics is the best, game play perfect and i set uncharted natan theme music as my ringtone on my phone cuz it touches your soul.... Great trilogy of games, despite the first being weaker the other two are fantastic. Fantastic bundle of Games!! Of course I love these games, how could I not. The 3rd is a step down from honour among thieves unfortunately as I felt as though they prioritised cinematic action set pieces over characters and story. But those sequences were also a blast to play through. The controls can be problematic at times, but I only occasionally found myself not jumping to where I intended. The characters and NPCs intrigued and entertained me, as you get all 3 games included here, I couldn't recommend this bundle more. My friend couldn't shut up about these games, and now I know why.. It's a pretty cool movie game, you feels like you are in a Indiana Jones' movie. But that's it, you gonna have a lot of fun sometimes, but you are goin to watch more than play, in each 10 minutes there is a cutscene, you can clock that if you want.. What can I say all 3 fantastic games in 1 package. Uncharted 1 may not hold up today but this game definitely had a big impact on modern games today so it would worth trying it. Uncharted 2 and 3 are the main highlights and were the games that pushed the boundaries of cinematic storytelling in videogames. With 60fps and faster loading times, this is a great collection. Only wish there could have been uncharted 3 multiplayer and extra content included.. Nice pack! Lots of action and over the top stories, really a lot of fun! The gameplay can get a bit repetitive though, since all games follow the exact same formula for both story and gameplay. The three most outstanding Playstation exclusives developed by Naughty Dog on Playstation 3 is remastered for Playstation 4 that is Uncharted Drake's Fortune, Uncharted 2 Among Thieves and Uncharted 3 Drake's Deception being remastered by Bluepoint Games with all three enhanced beautifully with a 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second not only it is visually redone but the sound quality was also being enhanced support to surround sound systems. I have always been a fan of the Uncharted series ever since I played the first one on PS3 way back 2007 when it was released and being remastered for the more powerful PS4 I knew I have to get it I gave this a 9 because I always knew that Bluepoint Games could've done more with the remaster but I am still happy with the outcome that they made and It was worth to replay all three on a much powerful console.. I loved the characters and the interaction between them, but the story didn't stay in my mind much.. This was the way to which I got to expierence all the uncharted games for the first time and boy what I ride it was with better visuals and 60 fps, bluepoint did an unbelievable job.. Being this has been the first time playing Uncharted games, I was skeptical to see if they still held up today in 2021. They do. It is no secret these are remastered PS3 games, but there is an obvious reason they have been remastered. These games are GOOD. If you are on edge about starting the uncharted games, this is your sign to play them. With some obvious derivatives of other media like Indiana Jones, these games hold their own, with exceptional stories, extremely likeable characters, and great gameplay. I had so much fun playing all three games and I cannot wait to play Uncharted Legacy of Thieves Collection. Sometimes when running or jumping it is not as smooth as other games, but this a minor issue as these games are so fun. I could not stop playing them and would recommend these to anyone.. This is pure perfection, the best decision of my life was buying this instead of Fallout 4.. This collection in","uncharted Drakes Fortune, Among Thieves, & Drake's Deception are the best adventure games . the first game might be kind of outdated, but its sequels are significantly better . overall a great game collection. Good story and goated protagonists."
852.The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles,"This addon is the only good part of TES4. The rest of the game is objectively garbage.. In my opinion, this is a great large add on. The world of the shivering isles is a beautiful land, with many hours of game play. Though a little bit expensive compared to other add ons, this add on is worth every penny.. The game itself was an 8 or 9, but the DLC was fantastic. Sheogorath is hilarious. It adds a whole new world to the game, similar to Point Lookout in Fallout 3. Interesting dichotomy of mania and dementia. Great main plot and if you desire side plots as well.","the world of the shivering isles addon is the only good part of TES4 . the game itself was an 8 or 9, but the DLC was fantastic ."
853.The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles,"Ace Attorney Chronicles offers a captivating blend of courtroom drama and mystery-solving. The game's engaging characters and intriguing plot twists make for an enjoyable experience. However, the first game can feel a bit slow-paced, which might require some patience to fully appreciate the unfolding story.. This is a great visual novel like game, and it's the first I played in this genre. While it took me a while to get used to the pacing (I was way ahead of what I needed to do and there's a lot of dialogue between each action), I eventually got used to it and autoplay became my best friend in this game. Never underestimate the Japanese slow pacing that builds up to a terrifically intense and highly rewarding ending. I got attached to the characters from episode 1 and by the last episode, I was so impressed with their evolution, resourcefulness, and determination that I didn't want it to end. It's a great story with many interesting layers. Without giving spoilers, I thought the finale was so epic. It was a constant thrill to think the game is ending only to be taking to the edge and back about 20 times in the last episode. Everyone is against you and every situation seems hopeless until you find some inconsistency in a juror, or a piece of vital information in a cross-examination, that takes you further and further. The ending neatly ties everything together and puts a ribbon on top, leaving you feeling like you took part of a bigger picture with many impactful implications. The graphics are great, the character development is fantastic and the stories are compelling. The detective puzzles are easy enough to keep you confident throughout. I think this is a great game to play if you want to try an interactive movie where you sit back and relax while using your own powers of deduction.. A worthy prequel/spinoff of the main series. Cases are strong, but it almost feels too similar in execution rather than actually trying to bring change to the series.. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles isn’t just a reminder of why the series as a whole is beloved, but also a reaffirmation that video games can be capable of so much more as an entertainment medium. Straddling the line somewhere between book and interactive movie, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles takes players through case after case packed with wonderful characters, stories, soundtracks and clever brain teasers. Although adventure games/visual novels aren’t everyone’s cup of tea, if you’ve been looking to try one for the first time or give them another shot, this is the game. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a blast.. The Great Ace Attorney? More like the Greatest Ace Attorney! I've played all mainline Ace Attorney games (except the AA6 which I will play when it releases on PC in January 2024) and the Layton crossover so I would consider myself as a fan of the franchise. The Great Ace Attorney is not a mainline entry into the Ace Attorney and should be perceived as a spin-off to the franchise, even though the game is directed by Shu Takumi, the creator of the franchise as a whole, who approached this spin-off with in a more liberal way when it comes to the franchise’s core mechanics. The game consists of 10 chapters varying in length and after finishing the third I was already completely sold on it being the best Ace Attorney game I’ve ever played. One thing I always disliked about Ace Attorney games were the lack of an overarching story throughout it, something which the Layton crossover introduced, and one that complemented the concept of Ace Attorney brilliantly giving each case more severity in the grand scheme of things. So, I was delighted that this over 70 hours long game wasn’t just cases tied loosely together, but consisting of one overarching story that unfolds over the course of the game. The investigation parts were the biggest weakness of each Ace Attorney game. This is also true for The Great Ace Attorney, although the investigations that happen latter in the timeline were enjoyable and the introduction of “Sholmes’s Logic and Reasoning Spectacular” really helped the otherwise slower and blander parts of the game. The trials also profit greatly by the creative liberty made possible by this not being the mainline Ace Attorney game. The reintroduction of multiple-witness testimony first introduced in the Layton crossover was a great addition and while the summation examination seem a bit forced at times, I really liked how they played into the course of the trial. The Great Ace Attorney is a great entry to the franchise, one that everyone who even remotely enjoyed one of the more popular Phoenix Wright games should definitely give a shot, you will not regret it for one bit.. If you like the other Ace Attorney games, you'll probably like this one. Same deal with turnabouts, investigation, and suspense except now it's Taisho Era. Almost everything in this game is AMAZING especially the pretty good story, The Great Detective is honestly one of the best characters in the Ace Attorney franchise, And many of the characters are mostly top tier including their designs, the only thing I don't like about this game is the *ahem* the one case with the wardrobe, Although the story is too long (in other words literally every other ace attorney game's story), but still overall a very good game, oh wait YES HAVE YOU HEARD THE OST ITS SO GOOD I LISTEN TO IT EVERYDAY IM NOW ADDICTED, IT HAS THAT VICTORIAN + ACE ATTORNEY MUSIC FEEL, PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE THAT DISLIKES THE MUSIC IS JUST NON EXISTENT!. Hey look the review bomber's gone! He must've gotten embarrassed after being badassily exposed as a loser stinkyface by the best OC who ever lived! Ha ha ha! John Phoenix triumphs yet again!. Such a unique take on the Ace Attorney series and one that I loved playing through. The characters are great and the cases while not being super difficult perfectly scratch that detective itch and all have interesting conclusions. Also Herlock Shomes might be one of my favorite characters in the series, love the juxtaposition of him compared to his source material.. Adventures is amazing with consistently great cases, and feels very fresh, and has awesome new characters. But what really makes TGAA Chronicles is Resolve. That's tied for Trials and Tribulations as my favourite video game of all time. Every case in the game is amazing, and the villain line up here is exceptional. The themes, like not overidealizing others, and the truth not always leading to happiness are really well done. The soundtrack and visuals are the best in the series. The characters are written so well and all have excellent development. And there are several moments in the game that just had my jaw on the floor. It's just a masterpiece all around. Don't listen to those negative reviews, they just capping.. This is my favorite game of all time, just buy it. the writing in this game (especially the second one in the collection), is absolutely genius. this game does so much so right, the fantastic graphics, legendary soundtrack, memorable characters, the best protagonist in the series, I could literally not recommend this game enough. I'm being a little vague here, but if you love visual novels, or you're just a passer by like I was when I found this series, buy this game. this game was 60 dollars on steam and took years to be localized, but it was all worth it. The writing is good, characters are engaging and fun, the pacing is perfect and the guy who wrote the previous review is a contrarian manchild. Definitely the best in the AA series.. The writing is poor, characters are boring and annoying, and the pacing is horrendous. Even the music is subpar. Definitely the worst in the AA series.. You know, I had a humorous joke written here but I actually just noticed the ridiculous amount of negative reviews and I'm astounded, because this is one of my favorite games of all time. Now this is all going to be coming from a girl who grew up largely on Ace Attorney... I can not be more grateful to a video game than I am to the original trilogy of this series. These games help guide me as a child, showed me the cracks in the law and justice system, and taught me to think about what is right for myself. I thought about these games every day throughout all of middle school, they're a part of who I am. That being said... the great ace attorney blows any other ace attorney game out of the water. In every way. The plot is absolutely beautiful and comes together far better than any before it, the character designs and their personalities are absolutely through the roof- the best in the series. And the music? The music? This is easily the best soundtrack I've ever listened to. .... I'm confused. I'm not going to make myself mad and read all those negative comments, but did these people not know this was a virtual novel or something? And they're mad cause they cant read? That is what I'm going to assume... but regardless, I absolutely beg of you to give this game a try, you do not have to of played any other Ace Attorney games before this, it's perfect as a standalone title. I really hope they keep the team that made this game and go forward with this Ace Attorney instead of clinging onto Phoenix. I truly love this game with all my heart, and Ace Attorney deserves better than how Capcom treats it now.. The best game in the Ace Attorney series, Adventures and Resolve together are one of the best stories I've ever experienced. The soundtrack is perfect, there are new mechanics added to trials and investigation segments which enhance the pacing a lot. I couldn't recommend it more.. The game is ok. Overall, the cases are well thought out, it is easy to control and it's a fine game you can sit and play quietly. But it’s really slow and it's not always that fun. I think you spend too much time on unimportant things in the game. It was nice to try the game but I don't know if I want to play it again.. This game is on the trilogy level! The mood, the OST, the character design are such huge thing in TGAA!. I just love this game, the well designed characters and the astonishing plot twists, just amazing. I think Capcom solved most of the negative feedback their previous AA games received while adding at the same the most appraised features from said games (such as the evidence examination). I think this game deserves much more attention. IHowever I would reacommend (if you are staring the game) not to search on internet for ANYTHING until you complete it… even the smallest details are crucial to enjoying the plot.. Favorite of the series. The second game wraps the story very nicely. OST is fire. Story is fire. Characters are fire too.. After these games coming and going during the 3DS era without a word of a western release I was initially disappointed, but now I see the decision was the best if it meant we got this: A 2-in-1 package telling the whole story from beginning to end, multi-platform release with physical copies, and choked full of extras to honor this incredible journey. With the best animations in the franchise yet this game also looks best in HD, and so that plus the improved audio quality made it well worth the wait. As always the story is the reason to play any Ace Attorney game, and these two games tell one singular comprehensive story flawlessly. Again I think it's best that we didn't get these games released individually, because they really do feel like one long adventure with the second game picking up immediately where the first left off. This is without a doubt one of the best stories they've ever told filled with mysteries so great they kept me guessing until the very end, and the plot twists and surprises did not disappoint! Playing in Victorian era Great Britain is such a charming break for the series, solving old time mysteries without the use of modern day science provided a fun spin and challenge with every case. This game also had some of the best side characters of any entry we've ever had with a memorable cast in each and every case, especially ones like Sherlock Holmes himself and his adorable sidekick Iris. With unique features to this game like the Dance of Deduction and the Jury Trials, it feels like there's more to do in this entry than any before. I could continue to sing this game's praises for several more paragraphs, but in short this is now my 3rd favorite entry in the franchise behind AA3, and AA5. I absolutely enjoyed every second of my time with these charming characters and vibrant world, with some of the best music we've had yet and some of the most intense moments, and a story so incredible I choked up several times. This is a game I honestly recommend to anybody and everybody, even if you've never played a single entry before. It truly was something incredible, and I'll always remember my time with it fondly.. An incredible Ace Attorney duology, second only to the original trilogy for me. Great characters, thoughtful themes and story, and beautiful music.. Let's be clear, each individual game would get a 7 and 9 respectively, but they should absolutely be played as basically one very long Ace Attorney game, and as such, it's a masterpiece of storytelling. The music is easily the highlight for me, but it really is just an awesome experience if you have the time. The investigations are still a bit slow, but the deductions help speed things up, just wish there were more.. The reviews of this game have hyped it way too much. I was hoping for something as good as the very first Ace Attorney, but this is actually a very uneven double-feature. The first half feels like a kind of experiment trying out a bunch of new features but forgetting to craft good mysteries to solve. The constant references to Sherlock Holmes stories don’t help, as these ‘twists’ on classic tales are vastly inferior. The second half is MUCH, much better: There are actual dead bodies and crime scenes to investigate, and an incredible middle chapter that is steeped in sci-fi and futurism. But then in that classic AA style, it ends with a ridiculously convoluted mix of soap opera and conspiracy theory, whereby you somehow end up ignoring the actual crime in front of you for complete conjecture on long-forgotten events. For the diehard AA fans this will probably be more than enough, but I was left feeling disappointed. A 7/10 game, one to pick up on sale.. Love the story lines and the vibe they’re going for, but it’s a bit slow. While playing you need to solve the mystery and then read how they’re retelling what you’ve just solved. If you’re someone who loves solving mysteries and participating in them, really searching for clues then this game isn’t for you either. They actually make the “clues” super obvious, it gets obnoxious. I was very excited for this game but it ended up with me just auto playing the dialogue.. wouldn’t buy again.. The Great Ace Attorney is a godsend because it fixes the worst issue in the whole series: Your story progression being linked to a save file. If you end up saving in a bad spot, you can simply use one of the many key points in the story and start from there, rather than going all the way back to the start of a trial. On top of this, you can have the game play itself, so if you get annoyed finding something in an investigation segment and feel stuck, you can just hit select.. Like me old grandpappy once said, ""when ya witness a review bombing ya do yer civic duty and drown the mug out."" Whoever went n' did that should flip 90 degrees onto the floor! Da-ha-ha-ha!. This completely satisfies the Ace Attorney itch and kept giving. The unique court actions besides simple cross-examinations added so much more variety and flare to the series - though I do wish gauging reactions of others wasn’t so transparent and easy to find. But all in all, I love this game. As an Ace Attorney fan, to other fans, I have no doubt you’ll enjoy this game.. Great characters and engaging story makes it one of the best entries in the Ace Attorney series.. Fantastic entry in the Ace Attorney series. The puzzles in the 2 games weave together into one intriguing and interesting story.. This game didn't deserve to get review bombed by trolls :/ Wtf Metacritic. This is Ace Attorney at its best.. Awesome game and definitely my favorite in the series, you can tell that a lot of love was put into this and it pays off.. Finally finished this and loved every second of it. They subvert a lot of past Ace Attorney tropes and give the series a much needed breath of fresh air, which imo had hit a wall post Apollo Justice. I'd say both games combined are as good, if not better than the original trilogy. I would love to see these characters return for more adventures.. The first case tests- Player's ability to use the basic trial mechanics Second case tests- The players ability to use the investigation mechanics and the deduction mechanics. Third case tests- Player's ability to connect more obscure information, and persuade the jury. Fourth case tests- The player's patience and their ability to speculate. This is where game 1 entertained me the most. Fifth case tests- Everything so far. Game 2 Case 1- Same as Game 1, but more speculation and observation is involved. Superior. Case 2- Same as Case 4 of Game 1, but faster. Case 3- Day 2 is a highlight, involving a witness that denies their own credibility, which encourages speculation.. I am at the last case of Resolve and I really did not think it was going to be so deep until now, I did'nt even finish yet. I made notes of what I thought it would happen next and I got it wrong most of 'em, making Resolve really unpredictable. The Great Ace Attorney Adventures sacrifices most of the thrill the franchise is bound to deliver to introduce the characters and build up the world so that The Great Ace Attorney Resolve absolutely blasts your mind with all the mysteries and plot twists. Definitely worth the time.. Objectively, the game is a 10/10. It has groundbreaking mechanics that I wish I had seen in later Ace Attorney games (considering they were implemented in 3DS before 2 other sequels). The cases are fun, and the mysteries interesting, since you can see that there is a bigger plot, something that in the first trilogy was distributed in all the games in one or two cases, and that felt fragmented and left out. In this game, the cases are much longer, and that made me a bit tedious, but as a game, honestly, he is the best Ace Attorney. Maybe the crossover with Professor Layton will just outweigh it, but it's a crossover, and it borrowed a ton of ideas from The Great Ace Attorney. You should ignore most of the negative comments that only criticize the difficulty of the game (which is very good, albeit with a somewhat annoying tutorial).. Game good very epic i like because better than ace attorney music good best game best storyline 100%. Possibly the best game in the Ace Attorney franchise and a great adventure game. While the first game in the package ‘The Great Ace Attorney Adventures’ at times stumbles with overly long cases or a couple of areas where the game doesn’t quite blend the mix of investigation phase with Trial phase as well as it ought to, it still is a good game on its own. When paired with the payoff that comes in the form of ‘The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve’ which is also part of this package it becomes all the more compelling. Some of the character writing, twists and cases in this second game are some of the best in the entire series. On the gameplay front little changes between the first part ‘Adventures’ and the second part ‘Resolve’, but what does change is the execution and level of restraint shown with the new features such as the Jury and Deductions. Where these at times fall flat in the first entry they feel like an inspired choice in the second game and build into the overall plot and character of the game. If you like Ace Attorney there is absolutely no reason not to play this. If you are looking for a couple of at times zany, mysterious but always heartfelt stories then this is a worthwhile package of games to checkout even if it did take many years to get a western release, its finally here and its fantastic.. Easily my favourite Ace Attorney game so far! I thought the story was way better than all the other ace attorney games, andit actually brings some new gameplay mechanics too! Like Dance of Deductions, the Jury System( That should’ve been there after AJ ). It also brings back multiple witness’ on the stand like in Professor Layton vs PW. I really liked all of these additions, it’s nice actually getting some new mechanics for this series. Albeit, I wish they made the dance of deductions harder. It really feels like it was supposed to be a trilogy, as the second games story felt rushed. But it was still really good!. Wow! To think there was THE hidden jewel of the attorney games. This game is perfection: 2 complete games with all its cases linked. The plot, the characters, the music, the spot on funny dialogues in the middle of serious cases… I really doubt there’s a better detective game ever (and if so, where’s your evidence? :p). I’ve played all the Phoenix Wright games and a LOT of detective games and this one is definitely THE BEST!. What a game... I didn't expect anything else of course from Capcom. Another amazing entry in the series like every other game. However, I still can't see the excellence that the Trilogy has. Let's start with one of the most important aspects of those games which is the brilliance of the trials. Unfortunately, I have to say that in this aspect the game lacks a bit. The cases, separately, aren't THAT good (maybe because the technology is limited in the 20th century, and it's not easy to build perfect cases). Another thing I noticed is that are some holes in the trials as well. Sometimes, events take place in a way that forces the trial to continue, even though some don't make that much sense. Still, they are not bad at all, but I feel like they are just decent, unlike the Trilogy, which has some perfectly brilliant cases. That stops in the last trial, where you discover the truth about everything and everyone. Leading to the next aspect which is the plot, and I must admit that it's the best in the series. The final trial concludes everything that was asserted in all the other trials perfectly. After all, almost all cases were connected in contrast with most of the other games. However, you have to play the whole thing to experience this explosion of overwhelming feelings eventually, and as I stated above, the pacing of the story is slow and a bit dull sometimes. Nonetheless, the end is worth it. As for the characters, there are some very interesting personalities and some not-so. The main ones in the spin-off are mostly great but, overall, I don't think they surpass the main cast of the series. Ryunosuke Naruhodo for example was very similar to Phoenix Wright but not so lovable in my opinion. Except, of course, Herlock Sholmes and Barok Van Zieks which are some of the best characters in the whole series, hands down. Also, the side characters aren't as interesting neither, besides some exceptions. The game has a very good sense of humor as well. Now, regarding the investigations, I think this game has the best version of them. The Dance of Deduction is truly extraordinary. As for the other aspects: The visuals are the best in the series of course, which makes sense since this game is the latest installment, as well as the remarkable soundtrack which is nothing you wouldn't expect. To summarise, this game is great, very lengthy, but not the best in the series, and doesn't surpass the Legendary Trilogy. It still is an incredibly strong installment in the series regardless. I also want to note that the review is subjective.. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a tremendously well executed narrative-adventure set approximately 100 years before the main series of games. The use of early 1900s setting and focus on real-world cultural ideas of the era give the two games included in the package a distinct identity and feel, which helps to refresh the tried and true Ace Attorney format. The structure focuses far more an overarching narrative than other titles in the series, which helped me to feel engaged throughout, as all events inevitably relate to or have some significance to the story later on. While many times predictable, the plot keeps introducing new twists and turns often enough to keep you on your toes. Everything leads up to one of the series best ever finales, which left my draw dropped more than a few times. The attention to detail in the localization of this previously Japan-exclusive title is staggering, the language used is incredibly well written and really helps to sell the game's setting. The characters, as expected of an AA game, are all defined and memorable, with there being a wonderful cast of heroes, villains, and just about everything in-between. The GAA's visuals are noticeably 3DS quality, but have been touched up enough that the minor shortcomings aren't particularly bothersome or notable, and the game generally looks pleasing to the eye. The music is similarly up to the task, and while likely not the best AA soundtrack it does impress often, and had me humming along on many an occasion. I do unfortunately have a few minor nitpicks and complaints which did hamper the experience ever so slightly. For one, the first game in the duology is simply far too easy, I prefer it when the puzzles require a bit more thought. This issue is largely amended by the 4th case however, and the difficulty from there on out is pretty much in-line with what I would want and expect from an AA title. Another minor critique is that I think that the game is probably a bit too long, the length is largely justified, but at certain points I did wish the pace was ever so slightly brisker. There's also a few character quirks that I found to be a bit grating, nothing that was particularly obnoxious, but the game could perhaps do with being less cutesy at times. Additionally, I encountered one occasion in which it's clear that these games were originally designed to be played on the 3DS, which did make me wish a bit that the titles had also been ported to 3DS, but that's quite a nitpick that I'm sure won't bother most. Playing through the Great Ace Attorney reminded me why I love the series so much, but also introduced plenty of new mechanics and ideas that evolved the AA gameplay and world. It's a wonderful companion-piece for the main series, but also can easily stand on it's own as a deeply compelling experience. I cannot recommend the Great Ace Attorney Chronicles enough, it is one of the best experiences I've had playing a narrative focused game in quite some time. As a long time fan of the Ace Attorney series this is (in my opinion) the best game in the entire series. The two games together form the best overarching story in Ace Attorney history. What really helped this along is that each individual case is fun and engaging in it's own way. Yet every case reveals some information that at the end of 'Resolve' is brought together in a realistic way. One last thing that made this game stand out over any other Ace Attorney games is that the game had a solid, believable internal logic. Of course certain parts of writing were identifiable as maybe 'overly convenient' but unlike older games, the path taken by the characters, their motivations, and what they knew when all make sense. It never feels as if characters are missing something on purpose only to notice it at the right time (older games did this), nor did it ever feel as if the characters all of a sudden happened to luckily guess the correct answer (looking at you Turnabout Big Top). Last but not least Susato is the best assistant in any Ace Attorney game. Not only is her personality great, she is actually useful and competent in the area of law. Her presence makes actual sense in the plot. (Maya also made sense, but you can't deny mostly she was just tagging along, and most of the actually useful law stuff came from Mia being channelled by her, which does not really boost Maya's character). A wonderful collection of 2 games, with some of the best soundtrack in the series. The first game suffers from pacing problems, but the second one manages to fix that - It is evident thar these two stories have been thought in tandem The second title not only wraps everything up nicely, but also wonderfully shapes characters, both main ones and secondary ones. All in all, I will not lie, I'm huge fan of this series, due to its stracture and how it meshes visual novel elements with puzzle game ones.... Thus this is one of my favourite games of the year!. It's a great addition to the ace attorney series and it's a new refreshing spin to it giving us some new and amazing characters.. Nice game good story, would be better if it was voice acted a little bit more. Absolutely one of the worst AA games ever written. The characters are mostly bland one-dimensional, boring archetypes. Herrlock Sholmes is nothing more than an obtrusive headache. He gets in your way, wastes your **** time with his unfun deduction segments, and LIES TO YOU constantly. Susato has absolutely no personality or defining characteristic. The one character I actually like is Barok, but he also jumps through stupid hoops to make the plot work in ways that do not make sense. I understand the bigger mystery that they were building up to in Resolve, but to be quite honest, it's so badly written, cliched, and contrived that halfway through I just didn't care anymore. The game's only way to contrive a sense of tension or drama is to waste your time running over the same clues ten times, while characters who could literally answer your questions just tell you ""No"" and then **** off. I've played every AA game in the series. This series was BUILT on great writing, great pacing, and clever scenarios. This game has none of them. What a damn shame.. There's barely any challenge in this game. The assistant is way too helpful. The tempo is also the worst. There are too many meaningless dialogs and self-talks, and there are too few logical highlights. Compared to the Phoenix Wright Trilogy, the music also raises less tension. I don't recommend any Ace Attorney fans to buy this game.. These games are amazing! The characters and story are in my opinion the best the Ace Attorney series has to offer. There are a few points where the trials can get frustrating or the investigations get dull but those are only minor gripes. For $40 this is an absolute steal. The updates to the characters models for this compilation are also great and the music is incredible.. A great edition to the ace attorney series; a good soundtrack, interesting characters and an historically accurate and engaging plot. My only complaint is that the first case is too long. Ignore the negative reviews they are just unhappy that this title hasn't revolutionised the series (which it was never meant to do as it is a localised spin off game). Having also played the original game in Japanese it is still the best, most well-rounded and innovative title in the series to date.. It is game is pice of art. Imho, it is the best game in an ace attorney series. The stories, the characters, animations and music are all awesome.. Awesome game with brilliant plot, interesting gameplay features and original game's spirit, but with some fresh ideas. If you like the Trilogy, you will definitely like the Chronicles. The great ace attorney series is a mystery game that plays itself and is a major letdown for long time fans as it's head scratching mysteries are no where to be found in this entry. I will say as a game, this port of a 3Ds title is competently made, as a collection I'd say it's what we'd come to expect from the people at Capcom. There's no technical issues to ","this is a great visual novel like game, and it's the first I played in this genre . slow pacing builds up to a terrifically intense and highly rewarding ending . the game's graphics are great, the character development is fantastic and the stories are compelling ."
854.Supreme Commander,"Still one of my favorite RTS. I come back every couple years just to dive into Supreme Commander again. I wish they made an actual sequel, sadly SC2 is nowhere near the perfection of SC1. MUST PLAY!. This is game is just awesome. Huge battlefields never seen before. Definitely one of the best RTS. Campaign and story is good enough to keep you entertained but sometimes the story missions drag for too long, however this was not a deal breaker for me as I treat the campaigns in any RTS game as a big tutorial to teach you about the game mechanics and I think this game does that quite well. In Skirmish the AI won't be much of a challenge unless you play against the cheating AI, which can prove somewhat fun at times but gets dull very quickly. As of 2023 I have seen little players playing this in multiplayer (where it shines the most) but Supreme Commander Forged Alliance has a good active community, if you like this game i encourage you to play Supreme Commander Forged Alliance if you want to play online.. Review of Single Player Campaign Only. As I pointed out in my review of Total Annihilation, 90% of all RTS games fall into the same trap - nearly every single mission is the same. You start out with a small base while the enemy has a huge base. The enemy does nothing with his army and just sends out a few token units at you while you turtle and build up. Then you attack and win. Piece of cake. The only real challenge comes from resources - you have to win quick before you run out of money. But! With an infinite resource system, this challenge is gone! And to make matters worse, with Supreme Commander the developers have designed the missions in phases. I'll explain with an example of the last level I played. You start out on a map with 2 islands, where you have to build an army and destroy the enemy base on the other island. After that phase, the map expands and 2 more islands are introduced. It turns out that there is a second enemy base where everyone was just sitting constipated waiting for you to advance the mission! OK fine, you defeat the new base. Now phase 3 - map expands again, 3 more islands, 1 more enemy base. Phase 4 - No new bases, the enemy just continually spawns units off-screen until you build 3 new buildings that you just unlocked. Phase 5 - 1 more enemy base. Phase 6 - 3 ""boss"" units are spawned that you have to kill. Every level is similar. You fend off a few repetitive attacks, build up an army, kill the enemy base. Now there is a new base - rinse and repeat. There is no challenge, you are never in trouble of losing. If you want, you can even cheese the game by stopping short of advancing to the next phase, spam power generators (infinite resources) and then advance. Here is the point - the game is boring. You do the same thing over and over again, and you are never challenged or feel like you are losing. The only time you will lose is if you neglect to keep building power generators. And yes, that can actually happen. Why? Because each level is over 90 minutes long! With all those phases, you get bored and just want it to be over with. There are so many positive reviews here, they must be reviewing the multiplayer. There is a popular client ""Forged Alliance Forever"" with a ladder, and regular tournaments, and leader-boards, etc.... BUT, if you're like me and you want to try this game for the single-player, I recommend you don't.. This game shared my opinion well, as I really liked the backstory and even the development of the campaigns, but I found the game itself not very fun. The graphics are good, the cutscenes are well done and I loved the voice acting. The models of the units are also well made, but as the game is very frenetic, most of the time the zoom is at the minimum, so you can see the whole map and the unit turns into a triangle. I didn't like the resource system and game development in this game. Another thing that bothered me a lot was that I found the classes very unbalanced. The campaign is fun to play with the 3 classes, but at times it gets boring. But the story of the campaign despite simple events that happen is very immersive. It's not an amazing game, but if you like the genre, and this futuristic approach with an ok story is worth it, especially since it's almost free these days.. This RTS has blew my mind. It's super difficult at first. I love the graphics, the tactics, the everything in this game. You should try it if you like mecha robots, strategy, but not the lol/sc2 kind of.. If you want a really large strategic strategy game, this is the game for you. If not use the robot to reak havok and make some cool bomber planes.. Incredible RTS!! I mean it has ruined almost all others for me in a good way!! I love the epic battles the customization the graphics the music the story the units. If only 1 downside is even on powerful computers the game can lag with LARGE scale battles. While lacking the tactical refinement and intricacies of other RTSs, Supreme Commander is ultimately a ton of fun for the most part due to the immense spectacle of the battles.. Scifi RTS on a massive scale with devastating nukes and massive prototype units.. This game lives from some gameplay mechanics, you will not see often in RTS: First of all the resource management, that is based on the ratio and not by collecting and saving them for later. This has a huge impact on how you play: You need to establish an equilibrium in collecting and spending resources in the same time. It is not a big problem to loose any unit or building if your ratio is at maximum, because these resources would be wasted anyway (or you build stores, that will be filled again after). The second nice idea is to zoom out to the maximum, so that your units become symbols. This is great, because it makes the game more strategic and less tactical. This is what I often wanted in other RTS and you have it here: good overview. There is another strength in this game: The story of the campaign and the 3 factions are well written, so it is a good entertaining to continue the game. Unfortunately there are some mistakes in the game: The missions are too long and more ore less the same (build up a base, defend it against waves of enemies on the same spot, build up an army and go), I feel this campaign is like work. This is the biggest weakness of the game. Some units, the air units for example are just 2D and doesnt fit to the good graphic. The AI is stupid and there are more scripts than really logic behaviours.. A brilliant strategy game that is as entertaining now as it was when first released. I recommend using this with Forged Alliance Forever so that they can get on the multi-player scene with friends or the community. It also adds helpful fixes, content and balancing that can really improve the Sup Com experience.. The story is such nonsense. Obviously there wouldn't be wars lasting for millenniums. That's just ridiculous and everything would have been destroyed by then. Peace is the only way out for sure. Gaming-wise it might be a decent game but the story is just downright nonsense and propagate dangerous ideas.. Almost the perfect RTS. Strategy, tactics, music, atmosphere, graphics, sound, mega-armies, superrobots, all there. Hundred-thousands of skirmish units have already exploded on my screen. It takes weeks to master, but when you do, it's worth every second The best strategy game i have ever played in fact.Greatest RTS ever! Resource system is ingenious, at least i think so. The game is very complex, has so many units, four factions total, GIANT units, great command structure, incredibly massive scale, Naval battles, and air power the likes of which I've never seen in another RTS!. Supreme Commander Forged Alliance is a very diverse RTS. The game features several tiers of units. Each tier, usually referred to as tech 1-4, the units have more damage, health or utility. Each tier having lots of units within them. Land, air, naval and stand alone units are all included. Games can be played with 2-12 players on maps that range from small to insanely massive. The forged alliance forever community, a community made by players with a better game game client than steam, is helpful and very friendly to new players. The game starts with just your Armored Commander Unit(ACU). Your ACU is a diverse unit that has high build rate but also can be very useful for fighting early on. Games vary immensely on size of map and skill of the players involved. Maps with high resource escalate quickly towards high tier units. Longer games will see experimentals(tech 4 units), nukes and long range artillery. There's also plenty of units that allow you to out think your opponent. For example some factions have mobile shield units, stealth fields and plenty of other great features. The Forged Alliance Forever(FAF) community has made lots of custom games and hundreds of new maps so game possibles are endless. Overall the game is a lot of to play whether you are competitive or casual about gaming. I'd recommend it to any gamer who likes RTS games.. The spiritual successor to Total Annihilation by the same developer. The graphics are improved and there are now 3 factions with what appear on the surface to be diverse playstyles. Unfortunately this is mostly on the surface as the large map sizes often meant ground combat became a total stalemate and it turned into a sheer brute force weight of numbers and economy battle rather than tactics. The existence of the shield generator buildings made it possible to create mass overlapping shield bubbles that made most attacks incapable of doing much critical or significant damage. Finally, the Commander unit itself while nice is a far cry from the Total Annihilation commander with its D-gun. The Commander was near the end of the game more liability than asset due to its volatile death explosion, and its gun, while in theory capable of one hit killing most things, was not enough to save it as the gun did not penetrate through multiple units like the D-Gun. This meant the Commander in mid to late game could not fight its way from any reasonable sized collection units, and was often reduced to hiding in its base.. This game holds a special place in my heart, I've been playing RTS games forever and this one never gets old! It has it all: GIANT robotic armies, tons of ground/air/naval units, experimental weapons (Colossus robots, flying motherships, etc.), great balancing, good difficulty curve, endless fun in Skirmish mode against AI. The campaigns aren't bad, they're not the best but they are enjoyable and have somewhat interesting stories. The Skirmish mode is amazing, AI has multiple difficulty settings that will never stop challenging you, the battles are complex and strategic, and the unit count is off the charts! If you like RTS games with huge armies, tons of units to choose from, MANY buildings and endgame experimental weapons, definitely give this game a shot! I played this along with War Front: Turning Point, C&C3, AoE III, Starcraft: BW, and Warcraft III, and the only game out of those that were better than Supreme Commander was Warcraft III. One of the best RTS's I've ever played, probably my third favorite of all time. The three different races are complex and give a good variety to any battle, and the amount of different attacks/approaches/defenses that are available is incredible, and will make sure no two battles play out the same way! The campaign's theme of EXPANDING the map instead of loading a different one makes the game require some heavy duty hardware in your computer. By the end of a mission the map will be HUGE and there'll probably be like 1000 units on it at once, so be warned that you need a hefty computer to handle this game, or you'll have to decrease the graphics a lot (Which by the way, the graphics are REALLY good for when this game was made: they even stand up to today's standards in some aspects!).. If you liked Total Annihilation back in the day, this is made by the same lead designer and is a spiritual successor. It has a current metacritic score of 86/100 and is a seriously fun game. It features full dual monitor support (each screen in showing a different location, eg. one on your base and the other the front line, or whatever you like. very handy for an RTS) The default population cap is 1000 units per player.. Looks great. Plays fun. Lots of explosions in this one. As with the original Total Annihilation game, I think the best part is that the production/building process can be sped up by having multiple drones (and/or your commander) build the same thing at the same time. Excellent UI design, in my opinion, particularly the multimonitor support that they have. This was never really a story-driven game for me, and I only played to build units and watch them blow each other up essentially. Of course, I do like to deploy my units strategically during combat, but I also sometimes feel lazy and simply want to throw units at my enemy until they die which SC allows you to do really well once you manage your resources well enough and you have enough unit factories and drones to speed up the unit production process.. A grand scale RTS, and a solid 8. Supreme Commander lives up to its title, you do in fact feel like a Supreme Commander. There are many strategic outlets in this game that you can employ to stay ahead of your enemy. Like the real world, information is a key element to your plan of attack. The large scale maps can leave opponents weak and sprawled, and your attacking forces can be seen coming a mile away giving time for your enemy to prepare. Base building plays a large role in survival in this game, expect to lose a lot of units to a barrage of artillery, nuclear attacks, or experimental units. Battles can be fought simultaneously at different parts of the map, managing your armies of land, sea, and air alone could distract long enough to have fallen behind on base building.. All I can say is, some people have a strange view of what makes a good RTS. Supreme Commander is a great title because this game is really supreme. I have played about every RTS I can find and this tops them all in its scale and scope of game play and it's terrific graphics. The abilities one has to control the units is simply enormous. You can queue up build orders, attack orders, designate patrol paths, set ferrying orders so that transports will wait by factories until units are constructed, then load them automatically, fly them to the point of your choosing, unload and return for more reinforcements. You can set multiple build orders in a factory: Build two of these, five of those, three of these and so on, even have the loop repeat. You can upgrade the Commander with various new abilities which differs by faction. You can literally scroll out in a second to view an enormous landscape and yet still control all your units with ease. The game runs very smoothly at maximum settings with hundreds of units on the screen with any decent computer today. The models and animations are highly detailed and you can zoom in very close. No, I wouldn't compare this game to the Total War series: Those are the slowest, most boring games I ever played. If I wanted something that slow-paced, I would still be played Avalon Hill strategy board games, like I did as a child. At least they were interesting. Don't listen to the naysayers here, just look at the amount of positive reviews and realize they are only trying to rock the boat. Supreme Commander rules!. is a great game but the ai is pretty bad, when moving huge amounts of units they collide and stop moving for a while and keep going again, although the graphics is nice and otherwise the game is pretty well built (AI IS TERRIBLEEEEEEEEE). One of the better RTS games around. Supreme Commander has 3 diverse races that have many interesting and fun units. Experimental units are one of the best parts of the game. But the ability to control thousands of units in real time on a large map allows for supreme strategy unlike other RTS games. Graphics are good aswell but the user interface can be a bit hard to get the hang of.. Supreme Commander is a really good strategic game. It is clean, fun and makes you think. The Campaign takes up a lot of time. Playing Skirmish is fun, especially on the huge 50k by 50k maps. The units and stuff are well designed, well animated and have really good sounds. This game is really fun, I have all three SupCom games!. A combination of Tier 1 units that can be massed into a huge force, tier 3 units that can be used in small strike forces, and experimental units that can be used as one would use a nuke in most other games make Supreme Commander one of the most intelligently designed RTS games in a while. Each faction is very similar yet not at all identical. The UEF have a health advantage, the Aeon have a range advantage and the Cybran have a stealth advantage. Those are just 3 of the many qualities each faction brings to the table. Do not judge this game based on the Tier 1 units, those are just to start you off. When you reach Tier 2, you have reached Supreme Commander.. It's been 4 years since the release of Supreme Commander and still today its the best real time strategy game out there. Though on a side note there isn't really any competition as any other 'strategy' game currently available is more or less only a tactic game. The variety of huge maps available through the community and the fun of building massive armies consisting of hundreds of small and huge robots, ships and planes is practically unrivaled. But even with thousands of units brawling on 40x40km maps its still possible to control because Supreme Commander allow you to zoom out into the strategy map. Where you can control and give advanced orders like ferries or coordinated attacks easily. The sometimes criticized resource- and build-system might take some time to get used to but it's in no way inferior to any other strategy game. The only negative critic I have is that this game hogs your PC quite radically. Even after 4 years and with a modern mid-class PC it still gets slow when 2000-3000 units are present on the map. In my opinion everyone with a slight interest in strategy games should get a copy of this. Including the addon 'Forged Alliance' it shouldn't cost more then 15$.. Almost the perfect RTS. Strategy, tactics, music, atmosphere, graphics, sound, mega-armies, superrobots, all there. Hundred-thousands of skirmish units have already exploded on my screen. It takes weeks to master, but when you do, it's worth every second. Even the atrocious campaigns with the moronic game-characters will not drag my rating down from 10.. Wow the game looked great i'll admit. However there are too small units on a too large map. My biggest dislike about this game is the WAITING PERIODs for your units to finally get to ur opponents base takes forever! building T3 and T4 units take forever if built with one unit...83 minutes! I noticed units takes a while late game b4 they actually build or move etc. good points r the mega robots and graphics :) it **** when in the trailors u saw this huge ass robot and when u play u have to zoom right in to get a scaled view. Id say get the game on budget like i did. I expected much more from this big letdown.","90% of all RTS games fall into the same trap - nearly every single mission is the same . with an infinite resource system, this challenge is gone . and to make matters worse, the developers have designed the missions in phases ."
855.Enemy Engaged: RAH-66 Comanche Versus Ka-52 Hokum,Enemy Engaged: Comanche Versus Hokum is the best helicopter flight simulation to date! The graphics are pretty good and the controls work brilliant. The most striking arguments for this game is the sense of realism and the wonderful gameplay. Great fun!,the graphics are pretty good and the controls work brilliantly . the most striking arguments for this game is the sense of realism and the wonderful gameplay .
856.Silent Hill,"The sound track is scarier than the monsters. I did like the look of some cutscenes. The puzzles are good too, neither easy nor difficult to solve. Considering the era it was made, this is a very good game. The sound track really, really got me.. Masterpiece. Also it's scary but has just the right amount of jumpscares. This is how all horror games should be. Psychological horror is the best kind.. this game reminds me a lot of my wife after the abortion, the way her womb was the Silent Hill. Jams Sunderland reminds me of myself, a misunderstood guy in a silent hill trying to find his wife because i got lost in the cvs. maybe if this gametook more inspiration from skinamarink it would be better, examples being long panning hallway shots and more blue lights! i dont like the grey fog it reminds me of the house fire.1/10. Gameplay - 7 / Graphics - 8 / Performance - 10 / Sound - 9 / Story - 10 / ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ. AWESOME AF GAME!! Gameplay is fantastic besides the occasional frame drops and such. The atmosphere of this game is so bleak, so grim, that every ""stage/location"" I go through I tell myself, there is no way it is going to get even more decrepit but it does. I have not played the original but damn I played a lot of horror games and this is probably tied for first place with Visage in terms of how terrifying it is. I know some people do not like the lack of weapon types but for me I think this really plays into James' persona. James is not Leon S Kennedy or Chris Redfield lol. He is just a regular dude. He doesn't get all them special weapons which makes sense to me. The things that I did not like include enemies not respawning, making backtracking...kind of dull and making the dark ambience kind of pointless because you know there will not be any enemies to back up the scary sounds so you just breeze through it. Also, I think there should be at least 1 more enemy type that is not a boss. Fighting the same baddies even with variations and wall climbing...became once again dull. That said, I do praise the placement of enemies. Dull as they can become, the jump scares and surprises keep you on your toes due to placement. That said, this game is so awesome narratively and gameplaywise, I still have to give it a 9.. Where it all began. One cannot deny the significance of this little gem ****. This game is a masterpiece. Its story and cinematic makes it comparable to the best movies, but at the same time it lets the player experience the events first hand instead of just passively watching it. PlayStation 1 games tend to set the bar high when it comes to storytelling, which leaves most modern games in shame. Silent Hill is no different. Although the story is rather short, one can argue that it's just long enough for a psychological horror, for which it's genre defining. If you want to make it longer, just avoid guides and walkthroughs, and try to figure out everything on your own. Even if the story is not the longest of its generation, it still features multiple personalities of well-written, individual characters with their own back stories and motivation, a handful of twists and surprises, and just enough references to keep the player occupied investigating them after finishing the game. The presentation is first class, with carefully composed scenes, which carry the features of the best-shot photos, and the ambiance and environment design is ground-breaking, and very unlike anything that came in that era. It would be a shame to compare this piece with preceding survival horror instances of the generation, because it's doing things essentially differently, and the setting and mood is much darker, much more serious, with levels genuinely unsettling and depressing, and occasionally near unbearable, with unexplainable horrors nowhere else to be found. The music defined a legend, and showed the upcoming generations what a soundtrack can achieve. No wonder people never played the series keep coming listening it. On the other hand, this game is 25 years old at the time of this writing (shame that we didn't get an anniversary remake), and the technology developed considerably since then. Not only graphics (see dithering), but also applied control mechanisms, which latter makes this entry harder to approach. I had the feeling that this game has two horrors, one that the developers intended to convey, and the other that the technology forced on them. Most of which is the controls are the worst. Tank controls are the usual culprit here, because it requires constant mapping of the characters position to the relative directions the buttons represent, meaning that one can pretty much press the up button while making the character coming down on the screen. Pressing left can cause the character to turn right. But this is easy compared to the fact that just a little overturn to any side directions can cause the character start moving backwards, instead of just turning back. And while doing so, of course the side controls also flip, so while previously moving forward-right direction, for example, all of a sudden it might move backward-right, often turning the characters back towards enemies. This little detail makes moving among monsters a way too frustrating experience of its own, but in the wrong sense, and tends to annoy the player (me) to hell. Had the back movement function been disabled by default, the control would have been much more approachable. On top of this, the special back move is a leap while walking, and is a step while running. Just why? These difficulties and annoyances render a modern play-through more frustrating than it should, and that's what is reflected in my score. Another minus is the voice acting, which is flat and lame, and rather breaks the atmosphere than supporting it. But I admit, examined in its original context, this game is easily 9-10 out of ten. An almost perfect masterpiece. So accept this review as an approach from 25 years later, and thereon, anytime one endeavors to play it, mind that the controls and voice acting will be subpar of what we are used to. Nevertheless, Silent Hill is a must-have experience for the fans of the series and for those who are seriously interested in it, for the reason it set the ground for whatever came after that. Believe me, the graphics and small annoyances can't ruin the incredible experience this game has to offer. (If possible, play it on an emulator, and don't forget to turn always-run on. Extra saves there can help to maintain our sanity considering the unevenly distributed save points in the original.). The best horror ever made for any console. Opus Magnum Team Silent in terms of balance between plot and gore, between minimal grotesque and surreal first-hand experience.. Silent Hill communicates paranormal fear, darkness, isolation, and a nightmarish experience. It showcases an impressive 3D environment, dynamic camera, and movement system with little control issues. Although the combat system is tame, most of the gameplay is focused on environmental navigation with some detailed puzzle-solving elements. It is a terrifying game to play at night or alone.. Silent Hill is as impactful to the survival horror genre as mainstay Resident Evil, and, in many ways, transcends it entirely. Moving from B-movie schlock to serious psychological torment, dynamic camera work and scrappy combat blend into a terrifyingly tense jaunt through the mysterious and atmospherically unrivalled titular town. Characters need work and some mixed messaging obscures a meatier story that can lead to a confusing finale, but, out of the gate, Team Silent came swinging hard, birthing a style that clashes Japanese and American horror into a satisfying spookfest.. I played it for the first time 25 years after its release and I am absolutely overwhelmed. Comparing this with other PS1 games seems like a stupid joke (MGS excluded) especially other horror adventures. The serious well narrated story, the exceptional gamedesign and atmosphere makes this game outstanding and timeless. In my opinion this and its successor are by far the best horror games you can find.. what a game man, when you play it for the first time in this decade with an open mind, you feel like this was a gamechanger in the industry. A True Classic. One of the OG! ****...what's going on with that radio?. I loved the hook with its atmosphere and soundtrack, its story of the best survival horror that played alongside others. This is an amazing game and one of the best from the Original PlayStation if you are interested in the game it is still worth playing but it is rough in fact the only reason why I gave it an 8 and not a 10 is mainly because of how poorly the controls have aged it uses tank controls which are almost always bad and the combat is incredibly janky with the camera often times giving you some of the worst angles for the situation but here is a tip treat the combat like a puzzle and it makes it more fun. Imagine RE2 without any inventory_management/backtracking but with several open-world levels (that is, not just a corridor). Unfortunately, the inventory is a core part of RE's difficulty, and without it the only challenge Silent Hill offers is the awkward camera angles.. I think this game is deserving of praise even 25 years post release. My first playthrough was nothing short of chaotic as i scrambled to figure out how the gameplay works , but nonetheless i figured it out shortly . This is not a downside however since i think the now outdated controls only add to the confusing and unnatural nature of the town of silent hill , making the gameplay age like fine wine .Getting to the setting , i feel like i need to add the fact that said first playthrough was completely blind , i knew nothing about silent hill beforehand , i had only heard about it being a good game but knew no further info about the story or the town or anything , and so naturally from the get-go i was terrified . The town of silent hill is confusing , its tiny , yet imposing and ominous in a way that not even words can describe . Everything from the fog to the constant ringing and the radio static , aids to disorient you and disturb you , that coupled with the excellent sound work and musical score by Akira Yamaoka and the rest of the sound team make silent hill what it is. I think what made it even scarier for me was the fact that silent hill perfectly matched my idea of hell , noisy , confusing , stressful , a place where no laws of physics apply and anything can happen and also a place where all your fears materialise in the most absurd ways and all of your animalistic ,human instincts and tendencies are constantly messed with .Whenever i try visualising hell now all i can think of is silent hill as it literally put my image of hell to picture . For that it has an immensely special place in my heart as a work of art . All this at least summarises the first half of the game for me . The reason I'm giving it an 8 and not a 10 comes down to the fact that i feel like the game just turns into a shootingfest after the middle point and is generally much less enjoyable , the puzzles are , in my opinion what keeps the game together after that point . And about the puzzles , even if you're not into horror games i promise you'll have a great time solving the puzzles if you're into that as they're all fun and pretty unique in their own way. Now for the story , id say its extremely good but not great , its enough to keep you playing and interested . it has an interesting set of characters , fun plot twists and a couple underlying mysteries which are mostly up to you to unfold and make sense of .What really elevates the story aspect however are the multiple different endings you can obtain. Sadly i cant say anymore without spoiling , but what id like to end off on is that this game is an experience everyone should go through at least once in their lives . Id definitely recommend it to anyone looking to play without hesitation . So , to new players go have fun and stay away from wikis and reddit threads, have a good raw blind first playthrough its a blast .. A masterclass in atmosphere. It's silliness in some of Harrys reactions only adds to the brilliance. The combat though is the of most brain deteriorating quality you could possibly imagine just so stinky. Some of my favourite moments came from when the camera became almost cinematic, i wish they utilised this more as when it was used at its best it was just incredible. Sadly got the bad ending so may play again to find out all the other posibilities this has in store.. One of my favorite games. Changed my opinion on ""tank"" controls entirely. The cinematic capability of video games was really showed off and I wish (sometimes) some mainstream developers would go back to tank controls and get cinematic.. Konami's answer to ""Resident Evil"" is a bizarre horror classic. It's unworldly nightmarish atmosphere is quite unnerving. The overall style has a European cinema vibe. This is a slow-paced, stylish game with a lot of mystery and spooky imagery. Multiple endings and hidden items add to the replay value. And the Dual Shock rumble feature is used in cool ways. However, the obscure puzzles will leave most players stumped. Overall, this is a must play for survival horror fans. I would rate it with a 9 out of 10.. The original Silent Hill has so much intention behind every single one of its mechanics. All for the sole purpose of inducing fear in the player, but in very subtle ways. Because while the game is creepy and atmospherically chilling to the bone. Nothing is scarier than playing this game without a map.. The saga that terrified me the most just with the audio and everything I couldn't see on screen.. The beggening of one of the best horror game franchises ever, the music is great, the ambiance is good, and other things. to make this a very good game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Out of the many, many Resident Evil clones that came out of the woodwork in the late 90s, none achieved anywhere near the success of Konami's Silent Hill. The first Silent Hill is a game in many ways ahead of its time, and could be considered more the mature, high-brow horror series when compared with Capcom's more B-movie influenced Resident Evil. While its sequels would refine and improve on everything it started, Silent Hill is still a classic in its own right, and one cannot mention this franchise without its wonderful soundtrack by Akira Yamaoka -- a name every bit as deserving to be mentioned with the likes of Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda.. absolutely astounding. It's difficult to give a rating to a game so mature and with horror ideas ahead of its time, you create a connection with all the elements of the plot that makes it fantastic.. Amazing game! I recently bought a PS3 so I can play this game and I was a bit skeptical going back to an old game due to being spoiled with modern gaming mechanics. However, I was blown away at how well this game has aged. The story and setting are fantastic and the puzzle solving fits so well into the atmosphere they set. The graphics of course are old but for me personally when it comes to horror games sometimes the “worse” looking ones tend to be some of the best horror games. For the time this game is monumental and really set forth a series many gaming fans enjoy. The voice acting is the worst part for me personally but nothing that was game breaking for me.. Still one of my favorite games. Its, like most survival horror games of the time, way too hard. Also, extremely confusing, i never beat it as a teen because i never knew where to go and what to do. I did it later i college. The SH atmosphere is just amazing.. Surprisingly good for a playstation game, that being said, unlike silent hill 2/3, the flaws in this one are actually kinda annoying, and i probably wouldnt have played it if it wasnt a required play for silent hill 3.. This game was ahead of its time BY A LOT. They dont make this kind of games anymore.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best atmosphere ever created for a horror videogame. Inflict anguish and constant oppression without resorting to cheap horror resources such as jump-scare. We will be accompanied by a constant fear throughout the journey of Harry in Silent Hill.. Through expert use of sound and taking advantage of the limitations of the visuals at the time, Silent Hill manages to become one of the most unsettling and horrifying games ever made. The gameplay may have aged poorly, but fans of horror will still find themselves lost in the rabbit whole of theories, mythology and strange lore. Silent Hill is a great starting point for the classic horror franchise.. This game makes me wish hitting a wall at max speed was highly enjoyable. 10/10. A young man searching for his daughter - struggling to exist in a place between reality and hell - a town hiding gruesome, dark secrets. Follow a trail of blood and mutilation to snatch a loved one from the clutches of a demonic power. Enter an alternative dimension where death is no escape. Welcome to the madness that is Silent Hill.. Beside my memories with this games, Silent Hill is surely game changing for that era. Everything is great in every aspect.. 55/100 Silent Hill crafts a wonderfully tense, delightfully unsettling horror atmosphere thanks to the sum of its parts. The foggy, abandoned town feels quiet and vast, rewarding exploration with plenty of resources, weapons and optional content, whilst simultaneously feeling claustrophobic and dangerous thanks to the various neverending hostile creatures lurking within the city. Hidden by the thick layer of fog that permeates the map, an unnerving sound cue alerts the player of their presence when nearby, imbuing the whole experience in a constant state of creeping danger. Alas, this atmospheric terror doesn't translate very well in combat, with only a handful of enemies posing a real threat, as well as severely lacking, bland boss fights. Nonetheless, the journey remains overall enjoyable thanks to interesting environmental puzzles and charming riddles that require an engaging level of lateral creative thinking. The story, a gritty blend of visceral human drama and real supernatural demonic concepts, is narrated in a cryptic manner which adds to the obscure mood of the game, and unveils its twisted secrets through multiple ending with different requirements, but most characters are not interesting or explored nearly enough to make their tribulations really impactful.. It was a good experience getting to play the first game in the Silent Hill series and I enjoyed my time even if I had to look up the answers to the puzzles to figure out. I am most of all just blown an way how good the atmosphere and graphics still on the PS1 the weird effect an origami figure character the side makes it a bit more horrifying when you don't really know what you're looking at. The enemy designs were terrifying and annoying which is maybe good thing because I was really trying to avoid them as much as possible. If you're interested in playing a horror classic then this is a good place to begin.. Everything about this game is just great. Sounds, music, camera, locations, story, characters, **** ps1 graphics, all of these gives you incredible experience of a true horror game. 10/10. This game is awesome. You are never be bored. Nowadays, other games are using one or two copy places or they are using open-world with stupid missions. This game has a lot of place such as hospital, school, park, port, sewers, cafes... All places has a lot of good puzzles. The athmosphere is very terrifying and, this game gives you a good horror.. Konami's answer to Resident Evil is a bizarre spooky horror game that is unnerving. This is like a Twilight Zone episode directed by Clive Barker. The surreal atmosphere is very cinematic. It's a slow-paced game, but the lore and mystery of the game is interesting. Gameplay is similar to RE and the game takes advantage of the Dual Shock controller in the way that MGS did. Overall, fans of creepy movies will savor every minute of it. This is a classic. I would rate it with a 9 out of 10.. A good game. I'm only posting this review to gather a list of nostalgic games I've played.. Amazing as a horror game. I like this kind of walking-around-finding-stuff games. The game is terrifying most of the time. I love that looking through the darkness feels very real and scary. The controls feel old, but that's understandable. The only thing that bothered me is a long walking around the city near the end (maybe I just could find the way). A strong 9/10 it is.. Good - music really adds to the horror atmosphere and the fear factor. All kinds of creepy tracks and sound effects to increase tension. - some of the puzzles were too hard imo. I have no knowledge of the astral signs, so there was no chance I could've solved that puzzle. I wouldn't even know what to search up since I didn't know those images were of astral signs. - combat was straight forward. It added to the horror without being over bearing. - the graphics were great for a PS1 game. - the fog and visual design of the environments were done very well. Made it all extra scary. - the story was mysteries which kept me wanting to know what was happening. New characters Harry came across also added to the mystery, like the nurse. - Voice acting was actually quite good, except for some of the awkward pauses they put between lines. Bad - lack of map in Nowhere had me very frustrated. Every corridor looked the same, every door looked the same. Backtracking was annoying. - the tank controls in some area were bad.. Sure it's not like Resident Evil, Silent Hill is a psychologically frightening hidden horror and is the number one mediocrity game, it's definitely so stunning that a real horror wants to take it without question.. There are plenty of things I like about this game: The characters are well written, and all the main ones have their own impact on the narrative. The atmosphere is extremely well done, and carries a lot of weight. It's depressive, it's dark, and it's immersive, even for today. And God, the soundtrack. Akira Yamaoka is a master of his craft, no doubt. HUGE mention for the ""Not Tomorrow"" OST. This guy alone built a certain idetity for the series when it comes to beats. There are a few things that keep me from giving this title a higher rating, though. For starters, I think the voice acting was overall, OK, but it certainly could've been better. There are some dialogue lines in which the intonation just felt... weird. The game also slows down so much near the end, it had me wishing it'd just get over with it. You basically run around an otherworldly labyrinth collecting a series of key items, and solving some rather difficult, consecutive puzzles, as you uncover a lot more about the town's secrets (which is the good part about all that). It can be really annoying to run around with no map, nor direction for over an hour if you're not in the best of your days; which I was, by the way. Speaking of puzzles, they're well designed, and can also be frustratingly difficult to solve; like the piano and zodiac puzzles for instance. You can feel extremely smart by solving them, yet extremely dumb for looking them up on the internet, or thinking so hard about them. They're tough, though, really. Unfortunately, I achieved the bad ending, which was almost like a joke ending, and I didn't like that at all. It's a real slap to the face to play a game for over ten hours, just to get a stupid, sarcastic ending as a reward. It should've been just straight bad. You might argue I should've explored the game more, but I tell you, I really did. Actually most, if not all of the ending's requirements are located at the final resort area, which is filled by monsters that wouldn't leave you alone for a minute. I still ran towards every corner and looked for every spot I could explore, but unfortunately I missed the requirements. I wish the game was more clear as to what items or actions could change the ending; it's all very non-intuitive. I'm not a fan of multiple endings anyways, I pretty much prefer a solid finale as to what really happened, but I can appreciate what this game offered for it's time. I'm glad I got to experience this classic. While not my favorite horror game, it is still a respectable horror nonetheless, and its heavy atmosphere and psychological pression stays with me even after I beat it. To me, this was a VERY GOOD game.. The game is a great fundation for the rest of the sage, the level designs and aesthethics are great, and the tank control and item managment are servisable. The characters are kinda bland but really likeable(unlike most horror games). The story and voice acting could really get some work. But I see this game becoming a 9/10 for me in the future.. Repetitive as **** but its 1999 so who cares. The narrative is pretty good but its the characters who really shine, one of the greatest atmospheric horror games ever.. This game is just amazing, first Silent Hill game is still my favorite entry in the whole series, Team Silent made very artisticly and emotionaly powerful and influentul game that is gonna be forever stuck in my head. True terror, insane symbolism, visuals and top notch Akira Yamaoka's soundtrack that just pushes the atmosphere, feelings and overal game even higher to the peak of horror mastery. Must play for every fan of horror, especially if you indulge in psychologically based horror. Do yourself a favor and go play the game, even non-gamers horror enthusiasts should watch at least the gameplay to not miss this gem.. It took me THIS long to actually finish Silent Hill 1. I did it, finally... Although I'm happy to say that this incredible franchise's first game is indeed amazing, I'm also a bit sad to see how outdated it gets as the years go by. I have to start saying that Silent Hill is probably one of the most unique game I've ever played. It's definitely not its sequel, but it's definitely one of the most remarkable games of its time. It may be outdated and rough around the edges but it's undeniably original, effective and essential. Silent Hill 1 made me feel dreadful - but In a good way. The main reason for this is atmosphere and sound. Few games actually got me this tense and unsure of my actions quite like this one. The town is well-modeled and feels like an actual ghost town, environments are not pre-rendered and that might be the reason why it's all so strange and foreboding, characters are mysterious and creepy, enemy design is good, it's short with an INTENSE pacing, replayability is highly encouraged and the mood is just perfect. Like I've said before, atmosphere and sound were key. It's an astonishing work of sound design and ambience. Even if the game had no combat, SH's tone and oppressive music itself would've been enough to make you sweat. The story also helps a lot. It's grotesque and often heavy. The mystery set from the start kept me interested until the end and although I feel like it could've been handled a lot better, I was craving to know more even after the credits rolled. With all that said, I have to be honest: the game does not hold up. Sure, it is great, but it BEGS a well done remake. Combat is downright painful, movement is stiff to a fault, puzzles can be very overcomplicated and enemy placement is just bad! Traversing SH's foggy envrionments should've been spooky, but the amount of enemies chasing and hurting Harry at ALL TIMES breaks the vibe. At least until you enter a place like the hospital or school. In fact, this is probably the main reason why I wasn't scared at all during these moments. Just upset. The story's also something that felt a bit underdeveloped in my opinion. It starts off great, but fails to explain essential plot points and fill the blanks. It's something that I felt that could've been easily fixed, with a few more notes or cutscenes, but instead it becomes a puzzle of its own in the end. As previously said, Silent Hill 1 is unique. What I've experienced here or in its sequence is something that I haven't experienced in other games. It didn't age well and if you want the full story you'll probably need to Google it, but I'm pretty sure that you'll love it anyway. It's a fantastic survival horror game and one of the genre's most original.. Literally a must play classic horror game from a development team of 10-12 people.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It is a cult classic of its time and a really influential game. Together with the Resident Evil franchise it made the survival horror genre a household name. In comparison with Resident Evil it is more psychology horror with a deeper atmosphere. It mastered to create an uneasy feeling of dread with fear of what might be lurking in the darkness, fog or unknown. The atmosphere, scenery and ideas were quite amazing and many games tried to copy the formula. Sadly also later entries in the franchise but I lose track. The protagonist Harry Mason is driving with his adopted daughter Cheryl to the town Silent Hill for a vacation. When he arrives at the outskirts he hardly avoids hitting a girl that was on the road and loses his consciousness in the crash. When he awakes in the town his daughter is gone and something strange is happening there. So starts the story with Harry trying to find his missing daughter while trying to find out what happened with Silent Hill. While the set up sounds a bit generic the story is really engaging and keeps you wondering what could explain this horrible nightmare. It has a fascinating haunting atmosphere that **** you into the game. There are multiple endings to the story depending on you and one is so ridiculous funny ending that even M. Night Shyamalan will not pull it of (I recommend to read a guide for the endings as a crucial point is easy to miss and some things are far away from self-explanatory). What enhances the atmosphere is the radio which give static noise when enemies are near. This increases the paranoia and dread level. Funny sidenote: The fog which helps with the atmosphere was added because of hardware limitations. This is one of the very rare cases where the hardware limitation improved the game (Thought before that this was impossible but stand corrected). The characters work also really well. Harry is just an average person who is thrown into something that surpasses his wildest imaginations or even nightmares but also someone who will not stop to safe his daughter even when it endangers his life. The rest of the cast I wont spoil works well and I was invested in them. Gameplay wise it was finest survival horror. The ammunition and healing items are scare so that you have to make harsh decisions as you continue through the game (More on higher difficulty). There are a lot of puzzles to solve but many are just in the take the right item to the right place category (Which was not a weakness or complaint back then). However it works well and kept me returning to the game many times. Graphically it was really good for its time. Especially the sequences. I must also say that it is outdated today but that is to be expected and cant be hold against the game. The enemy design left an impact as some types from the game / franchise are still wildly known and referenced. The soundtrack is unique and enhances the atmosphere as sneakily as awesome. Clarification: I beat the game before I realized how good it was just in another playthrough. Overall this is a cult classic of the genre and a must play of its time. A lot of hard work and effort was put into and this makes the game so great. Sadly the franchise is dormant now since P.T. was forcefully canceled by Konami but there are rumors that Hideo Kojima is working on a spiritual successor. Maybe we are lucky in the","the sound track really, really got me.. Considering the era it was made, this is a very good game . it's scary but has just the right amount of jumpscares . the atmosphere of this game is so bleak, so grim, that every ""stage/location"" I go through I tell myself, there is no way it is going to get even more decrepit ."
857.Neva,"The artistic direction is lost, and the experience feels meaningless. You will just wanna finish it rather than enjoy it. whoever wanna get the game thinking it will to be something similar to Gris, IT IS NOT.. unrecognized this related to GRIS . It looks normal compared to Ori will forest or any 2D castlevania like games .The battle system is unnecessary , I prefer beauty , A female do not need to act She is tough fierce or Capable as a man can do ,But that meaningless to me. Anyway,the view angle should be mentioned .The simple way zoom in/zoom out is kind of Art .We have many 3D games nowadays. but the view angle can't be handled well . a manga Have independent story,characters,Most importantly the view angle. Like creator filming mini movie as director by personally . Not every artist have good sense and taste ,which scene focus on eyes,focus on face expression,Behind shoulder ,From sky .It's complicated .. Do you love pain? This game is for you! It's an extremely frustrating an upsetting piece of ****. The platforming is ridiculously hard and the combat is unbeatable. You can switch to ""story mode"" which is basically a god mode. That converts the combat from unbeatable to uninteresting and doesn't help with the platforming. The art style is unique and stunning but overall this game has ruined my weekend. Stay away, it is not harmless and it does not worth your money or time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's a very beautiful game, wonderful soundtrack, but it's focused a lot on its combat, which is simple and repetitive. There are practically no puzzles, even though that is its premise. Its spiritual predecessor, like GRIS, ends up being a more captivating game that rewards you more for thinking.. (MY SCORE : 8.5 /10) This Action-Adventure Side-Scroller Platformer game that relies on Slash in its Awesome Adventure is fun and not difficult. We become a young woman named Alba who, along with a wolf named Neva, explores and cleans the world of evil forces! Alba and Neva must solve puzzles and fight the creatures of darkness until they pass through the 4 Seasons: Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring. On the way, Alba can summon Neva's name to encourage her to reach the desired location. In his progression, Neva grows from a wolf cub into an adult wolf. But unfortunately, Neva was killed when having to face the creatures of darkness that attacked Alba and herself massively and brutally in the Ending Game. Neva's death briefly saddened Alba, even so a little wolf named Bruma, who was the Son of Neva, became Neva's replacement to accompany Alba! It consists of 4 chapters to end this game.. Lovely game. The art design is absolutely wonderful, a beautiful and sad history but hopeful and good puzzles. All of you must to play Gris and Neva! I love Nómada Studios <3. A simple game with some gorgeous designs and visuals, I needed a little bit more from the action and platforming to fully love it but it was well crafted and effective.. Neva is game made by the Nomada Studio, the studio behind Gris. This is a really short game, without any dialogue and some mini puzzles mixed with platforms mechanics, there's also a small combat system, since one of the critics for Gris was the lack of combat or some enjoyment in my opinion, so knowing this Nomada Studio wanted to add small combat system, really simple and easy, this makes the game A LOT more fun without removing the magic of the Nomada Studio games. As I said before there's also some small puzzles in each chapter of the game, these puzzles are probably too simple, they could have made them a bit harder and be one of the main mechanics of the game, but even if the puzzles are way to simple the good level design, art direction of each screen and level makes the walktrough really fun and entertaining. In conclusion this game for me is an 8.5, feels like a mix of mechanics simplified, even do Neva is way better than their last game. I really recommend this game for someone who whant a short game without complex puzzles and difficult combat. What a wonderful little game. Unbelievably beatifiul, artistic visuals. Didn't know games like this still existed. I took a lot of screenshots. Relaxing game with fun, simple platforming and combat gameplay. Wasn't too emotionally invested in the story and characters, even though it feels like I should have been... maybe I would have if it was a bit longer. Other than that it was a mesmerising experience.. Beautiful and original if a bit short experience. One-of-a-kind....................... Nomada Studio and Devolver Digital join forces again with a new proposal after the success of Gris. With Neva, they present a new platform adventure that rescues the best elements of their previous game that, although it fails to surpass it, delves into new territories to take on its own artistic and plot identity.. 1. Introduction: ""Neva"" is undoubtedly one of the most impressive games I have played in nearly 30 years of gaming experience. Since its release, it has captivated me with its art and narrative, becoming one of the best experiences I have had. 2. Graphics and Visual Style: Visually, ""Neva"" is the most beautiful game I have ever played. The artistic style is simply stunning, with each scene designed with exceptional detail that makes the game world a true delight for the eyes. 3. Gameplay: The gameplay has improved significantly compared to the studio's previous title, ""Gris."" Here, the combat is entertaining, and the puzzles and platforming are well implemented. You can see the influence of games like ""Hollow Knight,"" ""Ori,"" and ""Celeste,"" which enriches the gaming experience. 4. Narrative: The narrative is one of the game's strong points. Throughout the seasons, a beautiful bond develops between the protagonist and Neva, which made me feel a great affection for the character. While the villain is interesting, I would have liked a bit more development in their story. 5. Music and Sound: The music and sound effects are also high points of the game. The soundtrack elevates the experience, making key moments, such as boss fights, even more epic and memorable. 6. Areas for Improvement: However, there are aspects that could be improved. The final fight felt too easy compared to the previous challenges, and some mechanics could have been explored further. I understand that each mechanic is unique to its environment, but a bit more development in the enemy's story would have been welcome. 7. Conclusion: I would recommend ""Neva"" to everyone, even those who are not gamers. I am sure this game will move them and allow them to appreciate the work of art that it is. It is an experience not to be missed.. I found too much difficult playing this game with keyboard. The game idea and graphic was good but some parts too much demanding. Only worth 5 dollar or watch it on utube - 2:50 - 3:15 hour. -people only cares about graphics. -very repetitive simple short 2d game, very repetitive boring simple combat, 80% boring simple level design, slow movement to make game longer u will use R2 always, easy disappointment final boss, no story, glitches and frame drops. -only good graphic, animation and ending. -gris better.. Lovely game. If you like Gris or Journey then Neva is the game for you, the devs have done it again!!. Neva is a visually stunning, story-driven game where players embark on an emotional journey to save a dying world."". A beautiful experience tha probably I will remember forever. Don't see any more about it and play it. Thank you Nomada por this game.. Possibly the most visually-beautiful game I've ever seen, with a soundtrack that, while a little stereotyped, functions very well and gels perfectly with the art and story. The gameplay itself is serviceable, with the simple yet effective puzzle-platforming element working best. The combat is probably necessary to tell this particular story, but is ultimately the weakest part of the game. Not because it's bad, but because suddenly having to think about enemy attack patterns, perfect dodges, and restarting encounters if you die pulls you out of the meditative, sensory treat that is the real heart of the game. Outside of combat, when you can take in the stunning art and sound, the game is close to perfect for what it is.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Dopo aver apprezzato tanto Gris non potevo farmi mancare questo titolo di Nomada Studio. Ho trovato un distillato di game design, tutto è al suo posto: il level design è superbo e pieno di ottime intuizioni, animazioni molto buone, combattimento preciso e fluido arricchito da diverse finezze (un esempio: l'animazione di morte di pochi secondi seguita dal ritorno ingame quasi istantaneo). Colonna sonora emozionante ed enfatizzante l'attimo che si sta consumando, estetica generale da applausi. In tutto questa cornice, messaggi profondi riguardanti l'animo umano, il ciclo della vita e molto altro ancora che scoprirete giocandolo. in english (trad. google translate) After having appreciated Gris so much I couldn't miss this title from Nomada Studio. I found a distillation of game design, everything is in its place: the level design is superb and full of excellent intuitions, very good animations, precise and fluid combat enriched by various subtleties (an example: the death animation of a few seconds followed from the almost instantaneous return to the game). Exciting soundtrack that emphasizes the moment that is taking place, general aesthetics by applause. Throughout this setting, profound messages regarding the human soul, the cycle of life and much more that you will discover by playing it.Exceptional, I hope the development studio continues to grow in this direction.. Everything about this game is good: level design, OST, gameplay, World and the dog, boss fights are challenging. Sound design in fights is awesome","the art style is unique and stunning but overall this game has ruined my weekend . it's focused a lot on its combat, which is simple and repetitive . the platforming is ridiculously hard and the combat is unbeatable ."
858.Startopia,"Very good game. I enjoyed playing this game a lot. I strongly recommend this.. I had played the game when it was released. I enjoyed it because I liked both Bullfrog and Peter Molyneux's games. Pros.: - Music! The best thing in the game. - Gameplay is quite simple, but satisfying. - The concept of three decs. - The whole concept and design. Cons.: - The game is VERY limited. It has potential that feels very, VERY underdeveloped. - None else.. Amazing and unique game that still looks great today! The music is awesome, the gameplay is simple and the challenge is definitely there. Did I mention its also funny? This is one of the best games I've ever played and still come back to it at least once a year. Love it!. Way ahead of it's time. Startopia oozes charm. It's mechanics while familiar are a little dated but hold up well enough. The personality is what keeps you coming back. Between the wonderful narrator, the cute aliens running about and all the nice little interactions that your inhabitants have with each other and your facilities - the appeal really comes from a full station packed with residents that you can just sit back and watch. There are downsides - it's clear development didn't accomplish what it set out to and there simply isn't enough content to fill a station - things run out of steam about halfway through a station build. It definitely needed more content and it's a shame the game was so ahead of its time because it would work perfectly with Steam workshop. It's not a perfect game but it absolutely makes up for it's weaknesses in pure charm and quality.. I love this game, I have had 100s of hours of out of it over the past decade and a half, even today I still play it through from start to end. I owned it disk, then got the digital version it from GOG and now it is on Steam too. There are few very space station games that are any good on the market and this ranks as one of the best. Many of the old Muckyfoot team came from Bullfrog and where involved with the Theme series back in the day. No idea what they doing now but i wish them the best. Excellent game with a great sense of humour. Recommended. Ages well.. I am sure in 2001 this was an amazing game however it in no way stands up to the test of time. If you just saw this for sale on Steam just keep browsing.. If you liked The Sims, Simcity Series, or any other people simulator-based worlds, then Startopia opens new doors for alien simulation with great comedy and very very entertaining. I gave this a 10 - point rating after recently installing this on my new computer more than 15 years after its release! Runs on Macintosh also if you use help guides online!. I find it really sad that today only few people remember this game, a lot of developers could learn from this great work, it's level of complexity is, at least for me, not comparable. Unique manager type game and this one really pleasant for me. I hope someday I can see a sequel or a similar game. I enjoyed the time what I spent to this game.. My favorite economic simulation game of all time. Fun on so many levels not seen in todays dumbed-down world of generic and unoriginal games. Try this game (even in 2013) for a breath of fresh air!. This game is among the titans when it comes to economic games. Excellent premise, excellent graphics, humorous, and, above all, incredibly complex. I'd give blood to see it updated or picked up again, alas, with the departure of Muckyfoot I am left with some W7 incompatibility. There is literally nothing that can be said about this game that is bad (except it sometimes crashes on W7). Everything is well balanced, sandbox is fun, challenges are fun, the amount of freedom is incredible and there are no two games alike, and ALL without needing an infinite universe like other games.. Humorous, complex and extremely addictive - that, in short is what good, old Startopia is. I can't think about better game of this kind and I still play it sometimes today!. Very enjoyable, good humoured, aliens and robots with more character than most *people*... The level of space station management is perfect to engage the player and keep them hooked for many hours or enjoyment. Highly recommend.. Amazing Sim/RTS. So much fun and personality. Two minor problems for me: steep learning curve (the manual is useless) and, like many of these earlier types of games, no pause. Grrr... The world is so beautiful, sometimes I just want to sit back for a minute and admire it without pressure. 10 years later and this game makes most other games of it's type look like amateur hour. Fairly deep strategy and wonderful personality. I actually had more success learning and enjoying the game by starting in on a sandbox game rather than the 'tutorial' missions -- just set everything on easy and it's a great way to learn. (""easy' settings were in patch 1.1 I believe).. One must expect issues in game-play when you pick things up nine years after their creation. However, Startopia's design is streamlined enough that when you DO have to micromanage, it feels tense and gripping instead of tedious. The game is gorgeous when you look at what it had to work with. I lost hours and hours playing this, mesmerized by the dropping energy levels and hoping that my neighbors don't hack into my space... Anyhow, what a joy. The main game is only ten or so levels, and I was relieved to hit it and be freed from the compelling, addictive game-play. Bravo, Muckyfoot, you did well. RIP.",this is one of the best games i've ever played and still come back to it at least once a year . the appeal really comes from a full station packed with residents that you can just sit back and watch . it's clear development didn't accomplish what it set out to and there simply isn't enough content to fill a station .
859.Fallout 2,"One of my all time favourites! The game continues with an even more intricate story. It keeps the good leveling system, enjoyable combat and all in all amazing post-apocalyptic atmosphere from the previous game. But it also has the same old graphics that didn't age well.. Accidentally left a review while scrolling through the page! Metacritic doesn't allow you to delete your 'review. ('ve now just copy-pasted an average score.). Slightly less serious than the first one, but still great and genre-defining in many ways.. Would be a 10 if it had the atmosphere of the original and less references.. Unfortunately, it's a game that's too dated to be played anymore. It needs a remake or a remastered version.. A followup game to the original Fallout game. Got it free on Epic and if not for that I would 100% never play this game, thanks Epic. When it comes to GRAPHICS this game has the same issues as the pervious one. To put it simply, it's pretty hard to tell what's going on. This is what I consider barely playable graphics when it comes to fidelity, artistically it's beautiful obviously. When it comes to combat it is also exactly the same as the first game, basically this game is more like a DLC than a standalone game. The combat of this game is pretty barebone and I was sick of it even before finishing Fallout 1. The game is difficult but not fun difficult so right from the start I played it on the easiest difficulty. The gameworld is a giant sandbox to play in with different points loosly tied together by ""main story"". The main quest serves more like an excuse to throw our hero into the sandbox world rather than something interesting. When it comes to sidequests 90% of them are straight up fetch quests. You either find an item or another npc. Ocasionally you need to find an npc that directs you to the item. All these quests do is make you talk to all the npcs in town to establish who has the item and / or who is the npc you are looking for. While there are some cool features such as a car the lack of other enjoyable activities makes it pretty boring game (the car disponed when I was in Redding... RIP). The combat itself **** pretty hard as well. You constantly miss your attacks, there are no tank mechanics or any way to shield yourself and almost all weapons do zero damage. The only saving thing about it is its detailed world. EDIT: After spending around 40 hours in the game I managed to complete the first part of the main quest and most of the side quests, judging by a youtube playthrough I have about 10 hours left. The thing is I just don't want to play it. The locations are interesting and I would like to explore the Fallout world, but the gameplay is just so **** boring.. One of the greatest, if not the greatest, games I've ever played! A true masterpiece! From my distant childhood to ten years later and almost 20 years later, this game still fully immerses you in its post-apocalyptic atmosphere, with the most engaging gameplay! I would love to see a remake of Fallout 2 with updated graphics - it would be the most epic remaster in the world for me! War... war never changes.... Fallout 2 is the same as the first for me, it brings back my childhood in the best way ever.. Cruelly ironic, superbly written and brilliantly scored : Fallout 2 offers a new turn on the series and a great sequel to Fallout 1. Through ingenious quests, intricate faction relations and a detailed environment, the game supplements the franchise in a great manner.. To be honest, it fells short comparing to Fallout 1. F2 got much bigger PR blah blah blah, but tried to play it right after completing Fallout 1 - and had to give up, it was disappointing - main quest and the very its idea - worse than original, tone and atmosphere - worse, too much content feels strained and out of place. Even Intro here goes weird and wrong - by the end of fallout 1 i could actually understand Overseer and his final decision - and not just for the vault as a community - i don`t see how main character after all he experienced going back to live in vault again , so letting him/her go were neither bad nor evil call; and here -""exiled, poor thing"" - already wrong. Is it a bad game - may be not, but it simply not nearly as good as original.. This game is a very good sequel to Fallout 1 and everything Fallout 1 does well, Fallout 2 does just as well. Once again, the main focus is player agency, a strong story and an incredible atmosphere. Here, it's less depressing than in Fallout 1, but the theme of an unexplained, unknown power threatening the post-apocalyptic remnants of humanity returns.. Like Fallout 1 but with some massive additions to gameplay and a much more detailed world.. One of my favorite RPGs, it has a great immersive open world, lots of fun quests, and ways to play the game. It is my second favorite game out of the Fallout series. A quirky and endearing birds eye view, role playing game that has some interesting talking heads and writing. The game is generally meant for people into a pretty hardcore role-playing experience.. CRPG perfection. I really think hope Baldur's Gate 3 success shines some light in those old classics, 'cause Fallout 2 was definetly one of the best games I've ever played. The game do not hold your hand at all and you'll nned to be forged in fire - after that, you're in for one memorable experience.. The Year 1998 and i was like 9 year old kid playing some video games with shared computer with my big brother , we switching sides and playing on turn based system . Then one day in our cousins computer we saw a video game that changed my entire life literally , it was a game with isometric camera style , extraordinary environment and the first time i seeing this kind of turn based role playing game . I've got excited and desperately would like to play on my own as my big brother would like to play this game also , soo I borrowed the cd of this game from my cousin and immediately rush into our computer to play it , when i first play the game with soo many rich dialogs , soo many different options to play with and it's unique play style i just shocked and become addicted on it , struggled soo much back then because my english is not good enough to progress into this game but with my too much older cousin help and also have dictonaries on our house that we searching the words to understand what the game is trying to tell us . back then me and my brother achived to finish this game and gave me the satisfaction that still i ain't get that satisfaction and joy from any other games soo far . Soo after years past i've become more understand the english language and like i was at 16 years or something like that i played THE Game one more time and fully understand that what the game is about . This game improved my english soo much that's one of the impact it gave me and also first time in my life i experienced the pure role playing experience which i liked a lot . I would like to thank all of the members of this development team that make this game come through . Personally thank Brian Fargo , Tim Cain , Leonard Boyarsky and soo many other developers and management team members . I hope that one day those guys come together and make this kind of game one more time , then in 2023 while people talking about Baldur's gate 3 ( i liked it a lot no misjudgement of that ) can experience pure role playing experience . This game is the BEST GAME ALL TIME . In football terms thinking this game as , you have abilities of the prime times of Messi and have physiques from prime Cristiano Ronaldo combined :). Fun, but you NEED a guide. This sentence is to get the character limit. Only four more things. There we go.. War never changes. A game that I enjoyed playing 25 years ago and still play now.. Fallout 2's greater focus on the interweaving politics of the world adds narrative depth, but also compromises the role-playing mechanics.. Twice the game made in half the time as compared to its predecessor and it really, really shows. The writing and overall design in world, quests, and moment to moment gameplay has suffered drastically. Instead of a tightly focused RPG that takes you on a journey through a thoughtfully constructed world by showing and telling only what it needs to, it's a mass of uncomplementing sideshow attractions that utterly lack the previous game's thick atmosphere and sharp wit.. Pretty good. .. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fantastic sequel to the first game. HUGE huge game, filled with role-playing elements and choices. Immense replayability. My only complaint is the implementation of stuff that does not make any sense and kill the immersion, like telepathy messages, talking plants, Monty Python bridge encounter, etc.. The game that changed my life. Best RPG of all time. NOTHING CAN STOP A HIGHWAYMAN!. Perfect post-apo light open-world RPG game with turn-based fights, amazing story and good decisions which impacts whole game.. Wow the negative reviews are sad and pathetic.. One idiot actually says it's good bethesda bought the franchise.. Talk about deluded and stupid lol@!!!!. Я: Стреляю из ракетомета Игра: You critically missed and your weapon destroyed.. Best game ever, true RPG of all time. Thanks Black Isle Studios and Interplay!. My review is based on my experience in 2022 when I played this game. There were some improvements compared to 1, the game is a little more fluid with less fps drops, some new weapons and armor and that's it. The rest is the same engine, same character assembly system and possibilities as 1. Although impressive for the freedom considering the current game mechanics, it is tiring to play. The story I found even shallower than the first, but with more game time. Taking all this into account, I recommend it only to those who want to know the saga as a whole. Remembering that it is an extremely cheap game. 55 out of 100. A worthy sequel with a cool post-apocalypse atmosphere and a very interesting world to explore, which has now become even more diverse and developed. Many new characters and interesting locations have been added. The vehicle adds more dynamics to the gameplay. The number of secondary stories and side quests has now increased, as well as the variety of ways to complete them. Character customization has remained at the same high level, where every point in the statistics can change the gameplay. But in terms of plot, the game, in my opinion, turned out to be weaker than its predecessor. The positive attitude towards super mutants was especially disappointing. I remember how in the previous part they completely destroyed the settlement in which I had so many plans. They caused so much grief then, and it seemed that everyone suddenly began to be satisfied with it. And even after that, they said that they would be happy to immerse the main character in a reservoir with a virus. It's good that the game still gives an opportunity to deal with them. The main story itself seemed interesting, but the main boss and motivation still looked weaker than in the first part.. This is one of the best rpg not like disco elysium crap this is how you make rpg. I will be miss by games, like Fallout 1 or 2. Just a good RPG, nothing more.. Played AGAIN with the Restoration Project. The game is still top with the same bugs like missing shots on 95%. But still playable, cool, nice dialogues. It's more logical with the improvements and additional quests. No more cheese of going straight to Navarro. Will always remember the day when my cousin brought me this game as a present on the CD. Though, I didn't play Fallout 1 before that.. I can't believe they made this game in 1998. Way ahead of its time. I played this in 2022 and it still felt fresh and new and creative. The sense of humour and cultural references really cement it as a classic. Just unbelievably good.. An amazing sequel for an already amazing game, fallout 2 is like its predecessor on of the best rpg of all time, continuing it's amazing formula of gameplay and story. Unlike the previouse games, the main antagonists are built up amazingly well, which makes them far more intmidating. Not only that but the game is muhch bigger and full of content that doubles the playtime of the previous game. SOme of the minor problems are the drastic tone changes in the game, it's not as dark as the previouse game, which wouldn't be much of a problem if the tone changes weren't so drastic. Nevertheless an amazing game, play it.. One of the best games to the series and an All-time Classic. A true Masterpiece ****!. True masterpiece. Fallout 1 was awesome, but this one is definitely the best Fallout game so far. The story, dialogues, choices, consequences, everything is truly extraordinary.. a 2021 Review - as a first time player, It stands tall above previous RPGs I have played, The story is intriguing and it really brought me back to the Post Apocalyptic Wastelands. This game is great to spend hours on, You will want to speak to every NPC and get every story. It brought to the table, everything the First Fallout (which is still an amazing game) could not. Fantastic Building Blocks for the games that followed. I've been through a lot of new RPGs, but Fallout 2 is exactly what I've always wanted to play; this game is good at everything: the plot, gameplay, open world, dialogues, quests, freedom of choice and action-there is a lot of this here, and because of this, I loved this game. Thank you, Black Isle Studios!. Absolutely beautiful game! Even if it is in 2d I is still very interesting and entertaining.. The original Fallout is my favorite RPG to this date. In theory, this is Fallout 1, but bigger. There are dozens of quests and a quite large world map. Your choices change the outcome of different quests and the way some NPCs talk to you. So as far as video games go, this is one of the best examples of a true RPG. What I did not like is the main story. The ending of Fallout had a lasting effect on me. Fallout 2, however, doesn’t offer a main story more interesting than its side quests. Talking about quests, it is full of a certain style humor and pop culture references. This may bother some people, but I didn’t have an issue with it. It also has a balance issue, in terms of difficulty. It starts extremely challenging and gets more manageable as you progress. Admittedly, the early-game is frustrating. My party consisted of Sulik, Vic and John Cassidy, which were all well designed characters for an RPG. I think it is a step back from the first game, but it is nevertheless great, especially if you enjoy an adult theme, post-apocalyptic setting and well written dialogues. Keep in mind though, unlike Fallout 1, it’s less about the aftermath of a nuclear war and more about building new societies in this new chaotic world. So if you are curious about the old school Fallouts, you will enjoy this sequel more if you start with the original game. PS: When Fallout 2 was released it was riddled with bugs. Also, the current releases are censored. I, therefore highly recommend to play this with the Restoration Project mod, which fixes the bugs and offers an uncensored version. 8.5/10. Just the best RPG out there. Of them all. Choices, humour, lots of dark and twisted stuff you can do, even the armwrestling that can go wrong on so many levels. Great companions and good storyline.. Thanks to fan patching (restoration project) I can firmly say this is one of, if not the greatest game ever made. It successfully immerses you into the dark world of a post apocalypse with genius writing and creative design decisions, the combat has much less jank than your average top down rpg of the time and the character creation is absolutely phenomenal and encourages repeat playthroughs due to the sheer variety. The amount of detail and little (and some big) side quests as well as a masterful main quest keeps you hooked over the 30-ish hours of content. And the best part is repeat playthroughs can allow for new options on nearly all of these quests. I would highly recommend picking this game up and giving it a shot if you're a fan of the rpg genre. A rare improvement on the original. Inconsistent misplaced humor, yes, buggy on release, oh, terribly so. But it was everything about the original improved and writ large. You really feel like captain of your own destiny in a game like this, even though it may be illusory. Grab the Fallout 2 Restoration series of patches from No Mutants Allowed and enjoy it the way it was meant to be played.. Best game I ever played. Period. Is a really open game where you see that your choices really do a difference, and experimenting is fairly awarded or punished respectively. You don't feel like you don't have choices and you are limited to what the game wants you to do, that's one of the things that I most disagree with Fallout 4 & 3, you feel like experimentation is useless by having so many invencible craracters and invisible walls. Apart from having the two most powerful characters in the franchise, the most interesting, and developed story, and the biggest plot importance of the entire franchise (also with the first one of course), it is the most fun. And also with the most polished and intuitive mechanics.. A solid improvement on the previous entry, Fallout 2 seeks to do everything it's predecessor did but bigger and better. The story, the maps, the characters all seem improved from the last entry.. One of the best games I've ever played, every character has backstory and a purpose for existing truly great. The game punishes you early, but battling through will show you a world bethesda could never and most likely will never be able to replicate. the humour becomes a bit much, similar to how cowboys were in fallout new vegas, but this time, its actually funny unlike the sarcastic option. the sidequests combine both quality and quantity very well and the main quest is excellent. voice acting and character models are spectacular, not a single voiced line felt forced.. It's a great RPG game and the story is a lot more fun and inspired than Fallout 4's or Fallout 76's for that matter. Its gameplay is great even in 2020 and it's overall a fun game to explore and boasts a heavy challenge. My one gripe is no being able to save in combat but that's a personal opinion. It just saved me a lot in the first game. The aesthetic, visuals, and music have charm and are chilling sometimes. In conclusion, the game is great!. quite literally the best game of all time. I made this account specifically to rate Fallout 2.. The best isometric RPG, it has a charm of it's own. More interesting locations, a larger world and a better beginning and sense of progression make it the superior entry compared to the original Fallout, while still being very similar. Even the bugs add to the mystery of the world :) It was an open world before such things existed or were mandatory, like nowadays. If you think it looks bad, take as a consolation the fact that it never looked very good, keeping it from a perfect score. Very nice another fallout game and is as good as/better than the original. Too bad for the Bethesda sellout. The best game of all time! The game we grew up on. A game that could not be repeated for modern computers and modern graphics. A game with an open world and endless possibilities remains relevant and playable now. And in those days - it was just incredible! It will remain in our hearts forever) And we will compare all subsequent games with it. Usually not in favor of new games). The best post apocalyptic game! Good plot. Perfect concept of the whole game world. Nice grapics and drawings style.. It's probably one of the best games I've ever played! Amazing story but graphics aren't the best but it's from the 90's. There are quite a few glitches that can make the game more frustrating. Still an amazing game!. This is a fallout. Real fallout. No other part compares with this part. **** you with your fallout 3. For me, it's simply the best game ever created. It is my favorite RPG and despite the years I still enjoy doing it regularly. While I only finish a game once, Fallout 2 always makes me want to come back despite the years. Frankly, with the ""restoration project"", which makes it possible to play it properly today... it's even better.. One of the most fun,immersive RPG's I've ever played. I remember the bug in the power station that made me restart this game MANY times before I got past it. But I didn't even really care. Because once I got passed it I enjoyed it so much I was ready to forgive the odd bug or two. So much to do,loads of great characters and NPC's,and a dark sense of humor throughout.. This is a great game. The plot is good. Various quests. The gameplay is the same as in the first part. The characters are cool. Full freedom of action. Music on top. You can talk about this game for a long time. Just 10/10. Best game I have ever played. It is dated now, yet the story and true open world make this a groundbreaking and pinnacle of the gaming industry. Yet to be reproduced, although many have tried. Want to be civilizations savior? No problem, drug addicted pron star? OK.Whichever way you choose, it is your choice.. This the best RPG game I've ever seen. The choices you made are clearly solid and effective. Also I love how game is making it hard for you but in fair way. You need to find your path, choose your priorities and make decisions. It's all on you, you may be controlling a virtual character but it's actually you... the pure form of you.. I don't have much to say about Fallout 2 as its much the same as the 1st game just with more to do but also with more technical bugs once again get the Fixit mod before starting the game. And while this makes many positive changes from the previous game the combat really started to drag by the later half and the beginning consist of missing most the time if you did not invest in melee because that's all you get at first. But whatever its still good non the less.. One of the best role-playing games. You can play back a wide variety of roles, such diversity can offer not many role-playing games. The game is interesting to pass again with different starting characteristics of the character, which significantly change the gameplay. Nothing short of superb - it takes ""Fallout,"" expands upon it, enriches it, enhances it in so many ways that it makes one feel as if the original was immature.. One of best games in My life, real Fallout, real RPG, real game with big soul!. this is the best fallout game out of all of them, and might be the greatest RPG of all time. this and the first one are the only ones you need to play. if you like modern games then 3 and New Vegas are okay. Avoid Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, those are terrible.. Most would say 2 is a much better game than 1 but to me I hated all the cultural references and just overuse of jokes. The game not taking itself seriously is my main issue. I prefer the subtle jokes and references in 1 and NV. Despite that however, it's still a great addition to the series. Story is great, good characters, great role-playing. Great game overall.. Played it about 6 times. Bethesda will never make a Fallout game as good as it was.. My favourite game all-time, all platforms. This game was ahead of it's time and the re-playability is very high! Graphics, dialogue, gameplay, back-story is top notch. If you like RPGs you have to play this game, you'll love it!. This game was I why I fell in love with PC gaming and RPGs. There was no better post-apocalyptic RPG since then. What Bethesda did with this franchise is just travesty. I own it in old school cd-rom (boxed version, steam (before GOG existed), and GOG.. After Fallout Fallout 2 is another great RPG game I play once or twice a year. The atmosphere is just something absolutely amazing to look at and just stare at. I hope BGS seriously learns from the catastrophic boring game that is Fallout 4 and makes Fallout 5 as good as Fallout 3 and better. Fallout 4's dialog wheel and short same worded quests were really bad.. 9.5 out of 10 Fallout 2 is an amazing RPG and one of the best sequels ever made. Interesting characters and quests, detailed world, deep RPG system and more freedom of choice than in all modern 'choice based' games combined. And very horrible visuals). It's a good sequel. I liked the first one better but this one do not betray the franchise, add something to gameplay (like **** the first one you'll hang out almost only with dogmeat), it's longer and have a lots of options. Try it, it's a very solid videogame.. Every single aspect of this game, make it a MASTERPIECE. Amazing atmosphere excelent sound detailed graphics engaging story brilliant dialogue complete freedom to do whatever you want how you want.. Fundamental title to have in every pc game colection I wasn't a RPG gamer at all before fallout 2, but after the experience its teh only thing worth playing.. Fallout 2 is a very well done game. Though it is an isometric RPG, rather than FPS RPG like Bethesda's Fallout games are, it is still a good RPG with heaps of great dialogue options and characters. The dialogue in this game even trumps the dumbed down dialogue of Fallout 4, which is strange, because this only came out in 1998. If you are a fan of Fallout, or even a good RPG, you should give Fallout 2 a shot.. Great game. i have spent a lot of time on this title. It has a great story with memorable characters. Good gameplay and best cut scenes with good dialogs.. One of the best RPG's that I've played and can always come back to. With amazing writing and dialogue, more challenging combat mechanics than it's predecessor, and a thrilling adventure the whole way through, this game is a must buy.. I played more than 1000 games. I played some of them for just 10 minutes, some of them for years. Fallout 2 is the best game I've ever played definitely.. I started with three and didn't play this until after a third play through of 4, so I can say without bias that this game is a gem and, like the first, is head and shoulders above the modern installments of the franchise. Knocked a point off, because the combat is far too random at times. You can have the best stats, gear, positioning, companions, ext. and still die four times in a row because of critical hits. That's not difficulty, that's bad game design lol Other than that this game is a masterpiece.. While the game has an interesting premise, Interplay, as evident by its later work has managed to screw up one of the best ideas in video game history. Thank God someone else bought the franchise.. The only thing that annoy me in this game, is the tons of bugs in the first versions. Ahead of that detail, everything on this game ressamble the pure adventure in a true wasted land. A mix between the future of Terminator, with brutal tribal gangs like Mad Max, in all trash way of the best thriller in radioactivity land you can imagine. Every time I play this game, something new uncover in the admist, and no matter the kind of character I play, fun never fail to amuse me. The kind of dialogues and answers you can choose in this game is beyond pleasure.. When I see the scores here, it serves to remind me that people's standards were as low back then as they are today, ah ah. Similar flaws as in the first installment: opaque walls blocking your vision, zig-zag walking, pixel hunting, frustrating restrictions, clunky interface, anti-epic fights, large empty maps, grind, and so on. And a development team that was still clueless about ergonomics (one of the main factors in the success of the IE engine).. I will start with saying that this game is far better then Fallout 3 (ps3), Fallout 4 (pc) and i probably enjoyed it more then new Vegas (ps3) too and tactics ( only played 2 hrs). Onto the review. Gameplay: This game is a turn based rpg , set in a post apoclyptic world. You have huge map to explorer and you can if you want to go straight to the last locations. The game has tons of various cool character you can talk to. And quests you can do. With multiple factions all with they own agendas, and if you don`t like any of them you can either kill them or skip doing those quests all together. Also every companion can be order to be offensive, use melee weapons or ranged, carry stuff or to wait or move if they stand in you way , witch may happens sometimes. It might no be the best gameplay but it still works just fine. And the game is neither to hard nor to unforgiving. Character development / leveling/skills and quest: How your develop you character is entirely up to you. Do you want to fist you way trough the game you can do that. Do you wanna be a sniper and let your companions if you want to have companions do the fight for you , you can do just that. Do you want to play the game alone you can do that. For every four level you reach you can choose a skill and some of this skills is pretty good and actually has a meaning. Do you want to be a sweet talker and try to talk your way trough most of the quests you can do that. Compared to the later fallout especially fallout 4 at least in a large extent you have more freedom in how you do your quests and how you accomplish them all with multiple solutions and your choices also has consequences. All the character you meet have their own personalities and perhaps even problems or a reason they need your help or a reason why the want to join you and lastly those character especially on the companion side is plentiful and enough of them but not to many and neither to few. All skills have they own usefulness. Almost every character you meet has something to tell about the world. Plus if you really want to you can be a made - man/woman. And lastly you earn exp by doing quests and killing or even picking up a special items or using seeing special encounters. So yeah the game is pretty violent. Like shooting the groin of someone or the head of someone. Factions: A short note on factions. Every factions as previously said have they own agendas. Some are evil som are good some are somewhere in between. Some want to make prostitution and gambling legal. Some want to focus on something else. Setting: Perhaps most important of all is the setting. The setting is great. It feels very mush like an a post-apocalyptic game. All of the locations feel different in a good way. Different cultures. Different rules in the different places. Every places has it own mini-stories of side quests to tell. And with the wonderful music it could nt be any/much better. And the game has tons of Charm and Humor. Music: the soundtrack is very good. And a lot of the tracks if not all you will **** really helps you immerse yourself into the setting Bonus: I would put it here. The humor is very good. There is a lot of times you will laugh. Like missing a 95% hit or hitting a target with 20% hit for that matter. You will laugh by the funny and witty and good written dialogue. A lot of cool Easter eggs that even i understood or laughed and thought was funny, i am not the best at finding Easter eggs, but i could in this game. And the ending is more then good enough to and so is the voice acting at least for that time. And despite some few crashes the game is still utterly fantascic. Give it a shot , even if you disliked fallout 3/4. Hugely different. Score : highly recommended 10/10 if you enjoy turn based rpg set in a wonderful and brilliant rpg setting One of the best pc game i have ever played if not the best . The only one that is close in Planescape, Deus ex and perhaps Max payne 2 and Portal 2. And just if you wonder i would rate new Vegas 9.5 fallout 3 9/10 fallout 4 6-7/10 NBI am going to say this is beyond me why this game ha snt gotten enough recognition, well atleast that what it seems like. How a game like this can`t get on top 128 games on gamefaq when games like fallout 3 or say undertale ( as ther",this game is a followup to the original Fallout game . the combat of this game is pretty barebone and I was sick of it even before finishing it even before finishing it . the game is difficult but not fun difficult so right from the start I played it on the easiest difficulty .
86.Virtua Fighter 4,"If I have to Choose, I prefer to go to Street Fighter 2 or Mortal Kombat, There are plenty of opcions Much Better than VF4, therefore I do not recommended it. This is literally Tekken, character design, environments, graphics, gameplay... Everything reminds Tekken. Amazing how PS2 fighting games are identical. Solid 3d fighting game with extreme difficulty spike for the final boss. Stages and character models are exquisite for the time.. A few hits, a few options, horrible characters with no charisma, crude and children's story, cliche to maximum, graphics outdated for the time it was released. This game was made with the ass, his rival, the Incredible Tekken, it was far superior even to put the 3, it's better than Virtua Fighter 4, the first VF until it was mass play in the classic Mega Drive. Make a well yourself, do not play Virtua Fighter 4.. When I first played Virtua Fighter 4 I thought it would be a Street Fighter knock-off. But it had some memorable characters with hilariously bad dialogue. The level designs were pretty cool though, and I thoroughly enjoyed being able to knock opponents off the stage. I know this is not in an original concept, but it was implemented well nonetheless. The fighting felt a bit different than other games, and as a big fan of fighting games, that made it cool. It's good to not be able to just use the same button sets as other games, though they're similar enough to be easy to learn by new users. It's a very well done game, though it has its flaws it's a charming game, and it's easily a 7, but adding some nostalgia to my score, it's a solid 8 for me, not to mention, the graphics were stunning and far superior to the Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter contemporaries.. It is a fighter that will provide countless hours of fun. Plenty of characters coupled with great graphics, intense fighting, and a lot of combo moves that can be done.","a solid 3d fighting game with extreme difficulty spike for the final boss . a few hits, a few options, horrible characters with no charisma, crude and children's story . it's better than Virtua Fighter 4, the first VF until it was mass play in the classic Mega Drive ."
