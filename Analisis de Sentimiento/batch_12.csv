485.Alan Wake II,"First few hours are great: the game looks stunning and it has a promising atmosphere. Too bad it just falls flat right after the beginning. There are big pacing issues (no, centering the narrative around loops does not solve the problem of having a repetitive gameplay), the story is convoluted and way too derivative of Twin Peaks, characters are not memorable in any way, the “detective” mechanic is so disappointing and boring… it seems to pick up some steam around the ending, but then again it ends up being too stretched out. It’s a shame, because again it looks BEAUTIFUL, but it ends up feeling a little like a 30-hour long technical showcase.. Absolutely loved the game, great follow up to the first Alan Wake. The music was amazing, really ties in well with the game. The characters are all interesting and will have you wanting to know more. The story can jump around a lot, but it makes sense in the end. The only thing that stops me from giving it a 10/10 is the combat and movement felt slow to me.. Nice visual and sound. The part for Saga is interesting. The part for Alan is terrible. It's very boring to wander around crazy, changing locations like in nightmare. If it weren't for the gameplay for Alan, I would have raised the rating.. The graphical fidelity and acting are of the highest standard. The atmosphere and Twilight Zone / X-files themes are cool. It kept my attention for 70 hours, so it's a good game worth playing. What stops it from being a *great* game is a story that is too convoluted and combat that is too clunky.. The only thing this game has going for it is Remedy's particular brand of weird. Incredibly dull combat, over reliance on jump scares that wear off before they've even arrived, puzzles that come out of maths textbooks, and frustrating level ""design"" that either deliberately or unintentionally makes you go through loops either because they thought that rather boring idea wasn't as boring as it actually is, or you just have no real sense of where you're meant to be going.. Alan Wake 2 is truly a masterpiece. Gameplay is fun and feels tight. The graphics are among the best I’ve ever seen and the sound design is excellent. Above all else though the story and constant changes it makes does something I’ve never experienced in all my years of playing games. This is a game that anybody who values games as an art should at least try.. Sam Lake's magnum opus. A warm sunset embrace from the past. It's not a lake, it's an ocean.. Finally manage to play and finish Alan wake 2 deluxe edition. Where to start ? If you played Control, you'll enjoy even more AW2 Game is simply amazing, the atmosphere is incredible, the OST is a 10/10 that gives me goosebump, deep, weird, genius It's a slow game that had to beenjoyed without haste. I don't know howpeople say it's a 14hours game, It takes me almost 60 hours to play it ( still missing something, not yet platinum ) If I had to complain about something ? maybe it's a little too long, could be a little less, I found also control was a little longer. Played on ps5 pro with ray tracing VRR 140hz and was an incredible visual experience, little flickering with flashlight still Long live old gods of asgard. The first AlanWakenwas considered suspense thriller when they said Alan Wake 2 will be horrors I thought what more could they do because the first one kinda terrifying to me and uh boy how wrong I was. Alan Wake improved on every aspect of the first game and way more terrifying. A true horror game in every sense and I love it. To the point I went crazy and bought it on multiple platforms. Remedy really knows how to make great games, I just hope they don't make us wait another 10 + years. One of my favourite new releases, very well made game with the Remedy magic we all know and love. Fantastic story, intuitive gameplay and plenty of horror elements that make this game Interesting from start to finish.. My first game for new generation consoles, and it was very impressive to me. it was scary, the gameplay was perfect, the graphics were pretty great, but the story is a little bit difficult to understand for me as a non english speaker.. When it comes to storytelling Alan Wake 2 is exceptional in this. The directing win for a reason. It is very immersing and I loved that about this game. Also the selection of music is great and I enjoyed ending every chapter by song pause. Why do I not rate 10? Because when it comes to gameplay, you are stucked with pure solving puzzles and finding of keys and items scattered around map. Before this I played the remake of Silent Hill 2 and it handled this part much more effectively - it was also much more scarry. Anyway in Alan Wake 2 I was tired of exploring, not because of playing similar type of game, but because of slow movement on map - you are force to come back to same locations so many times. After all in Saga's story there are only 3 areas - sure something new opens everytime but honestly I never felt well awarded for further exploring. The further gameplay doesn't brings more vivid gameplay too. In Alans story you get such a lamp to change the surrounding and you may involve writing which changes it too according the plot you put. But it works on certain locations and I felt, that it works strangely. You have to first acquire plot to implement it. I don't know why, but it didn't sound natural for me, as well for Alan, who is in the end the creator of plots. I would have expecter little bit more of this. The biggest let down is combat. I was fun at first, but honestly you only dodge, shoot or stun enemy with light in the end of the day. There is nothing else. It wouldn't be a issue if reloading and healing wouldn't be so slow. Someone may argue, that they wanted to get close to reality, but honestly Saga nor Alan have time for everything - even in face of ""armagedon"". It was frustrating, expecially in combat with more enemies. Many times I died just because I could not reload, you try to dodge and the action is cancelled, you have to do it again a run from enemy fists - but there are enemies that fast jump to you or throw axes on you, so it is not big help. It was really annoying. Also I did not understand the crossbow weapon - reload takes a lot lot lot time and I thought that it will be at least strong - **** doesn't make big difference and it takes up a lot space in your bag, so I left if in the shoe box. Now I started playing Resident Evil Village and I feel the gameplay is way swifter and better done. Also the case boared you have to do to get story going felt many times just about choosing right place for a photo. So Alan Wake is amazingly made game when it comes to story, sounding and directing, but gameplay is mediocre and could be annoying and slow.. After playing Silent Hill 2, I don’t feel any fear in this game. I also don’t see outstanding graphics, even though I’m playing it on the PS5 Pro.. Perfect, down to the last minute detail. The unique blend of a multitude of media variants seamlessly together to form an eerie, supernatural horror game where reality distorts and reinvents itself forcing you to never trust anything except your flashlight. The music absolutely slaps and ""We Sing"" was the most special, unique and entrancing parts **** I've ever played and had me playing the Game's Soundtrack on loop well before I even completed the game. The voice acting, the live action acting/performances, the story and each character are the most captivating and impressive that I've experienced in a video game. Alan Wake, Saga Anderson, Casey Jones, Mr. Door and even Tim Breaker are an amazing ensemble and feel so real and fleshed out. Genuinely this game is so special, I love the passion, creativity and hard work that went into the making of this game. The fact they squeezed the whole game and Night Springs onto one disc is a testament to Remedy's compassion for the people who still buy Physical. The only nit-pick I could say against this game is that the ending was an absolute let down. Regardless, enjoyed every minute of this experience. Thank you Remedy and thank you Sam Lake.. One of the best games ever made. I played and completed Alan wake 1 just before I moved onto Alan wake 2. The atmosphere, Graphics, story, shooting,Charm are up there with the best games. Remedy Games are imo up there with the best Devs in the industry. I enjoyed every minute of The game. Thank you Remedy Games for making a masterpiece.. Overall: 80/100 For detailed review see my article on X titled ""Alan Wake 2 Review: A Haunting Masterpiece with Room to Shine"" Story: 19/20 Gameplay & Controls: 15/20 Graphics: 19/20 Music & Sound: 15/20 Replay Value 12/20. An incredible and immersive story, everything we wanted in the second Alan Wake game. The best narrative for anyone seeking a thriller that delves into the darkest corners of the human mind. Like Alan Wake himself, playing this game made me feel trapped and anguished. At some point in life, we’ve all felt like Alan Wake. A masterpiece.. Definently one of the best games of this year. Graphics are amazing, is really scary. One of the scariest games I ever played.. A mustplay, for horror game fans. Also if you enjoy a good investigation story. Poets of the fall stole the game's thunder again.. Honest to god while it’s a good game. It felt like a chore to complete. I didn’t like the case board at all and Alan Wake’s segments were not as fun as I wanted them to be. Saga overall hadbetter gameplay besides the case study crap.Like I said it was a good game just not want I was expecting. One of the few games that's had a long lasting impact on me, I'm obsessed with the narrative and the world Remedy has created here. No game has kept me this engaged from start to finish (even after finishing it as well, as there's so much to uncover still). So many incredible moments, with top tier art direction, sound design, music, and such an amazing atmosphere.. Read a ton of great reviews. After an hour of progress, I quit the game thinking they must have had auto saves. Nope. Apparently, you can't save the game until you finish the second chapter, and even then, you have to find some witches hut and click on a thermos or such. Game doesn't tell you this. I had to do my searching on the internet on how to save. Look, it should be game making 101 to have a decent save feature. Thus, I give this game zero. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Let me start by saying that the first game have an okay plot but horrific gameplay. I can’t say I was excited for this sequel, but after seeing all the hype and positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. Oh boy, that turned out to be my biggest mistake and an absolute waste of money. First of all, the game is boring from the very beginning. The story is uninteresting and fails to grab attention. From the trailers, I expected some “True Detective” vibes, but the world is uninspiring, and the characters are super generic. One of the main gameplay mechanics finding and placing clues is among the worst ideas that could possibly come to a developer’s **** gameplay breakdown is roughly as follows: 10% boring cutscenes, 20% placing clues and wandering in a hub area, 70% walking around aimlessly, finding clues, or doing nothing. If there were a contest for the worst map design ever, this game could easily win it. I am so disappointed that I can’t even put my anger into words. People have been praising this game and calling it a masterpiece, but I couldn’t disagree more. I don’t need to tell you not to buy this game as its sales speak for themselves. This is just an indie game with good graphics, terrible gameplay, and a boring story. As far as I’m concerned, this studio is dead to me. There’s no way I’ll try their next game.. Once in a long while, a cultural magnum opus come around. A work of art that is transcendent, that make us, as an audience, feel something new and elevates our conscience in a way. Alan Wake 2 is such a work of art. Buy this game, experience it for yourself. Let the people of Remedy and its amazing artists tell you their story.. Not recommended, you don't get to see ending of the game with 1st playthrough, the game want to force you to play the game again from beginning in new game plus so you put up at least 20h with their nonsense story so they show you the game's ending which they must have showed it in the 1st playthrough, story starts very good but the more you play the more nonsense it becomes with inconsistencies and too many questions not because the story is deep or complicated because it's simply nonsense and the writer had no answer for them.. more than a videogame, it's a piece of an art, absolutely unique experience. Graphics: 10 / Gameplay: 7 / Story: 8 / Lore/Soundtrack: 10 / Total: 8,75 = 9. Very close to the masterpiece. Gameplay is rich, graphics and the visuals are astonishing, music is very good. Loved it a lot despite not being a horror fan.. I am in love with this game, it is an unforgettable experience. After finishing the second part I played the first one just bc the story was so engaging that I wanted more and more of this Remedy universe narrative. Thank you, Remedy!. What the heck is this ? Boring, tedious, clunky gameplay, messed plot, no soundtracks during the gameplay.....completely different from the first one ( which is much better ). Absolutely disappointing.. One of my favorite games. I was hooked from the start and had to keep on exploring and delving deeper into the mystery. Gameplay is very exciting with a few jump scares to keep you at the edge of your seat.. this is a horror investigating game which dont put you in much action. its more a thriller game and you have to find clues and such things. i find it pretty boring and i think this is not a game for everyone. if you really like much horror survival game then this might be for you but dont expect alot of fights and action with this game. i think calling this a masterpiece like some do is exagerated. the graphics are good but the gameplay is very slow and boring to me.. Graphics are great but is a weird game. Ask 10 different people and they will give you 10 different answers on what the story is about. Too much going back and forth in the same place. Has its moment but nowhere near a great game.. Is it a video game ? Is it a movie ? Is it a book ? Is it fiction ? Is it real ? This for sure is a masterpiece. A wonderful story narrated in the best possible way. I am and always has been a survival horror fan. This is the best story I ever had to play - read - live. This game deserves to be played and acclaimed.. Simply amazing! A work of art. A great horror, a trip, a madness, a GOTY!!!. This game is graphically a masterpiece the gameplay it’s a little bit so so, but the story is very fulfilling. I I do not like having to use the mind place all the time and having to place different files in the right spot Gets in the way of the continuity of the game to me. But all in all, I think they hit a home run with this one. Too hard. Died again and again and again to the first 2 bullet sponge enemies in the lake. And yes, I know about using the torch and dodging. Also, who thought the case boards was a good idea? Frustratingly trying to find where the photo’s go until I lose the will to live. Just a bit too much up itself.. Amazing, i loved this game in every aspect. 10/10 soundtrack 10/10 history 6 bugs. It is so fresh game because something new and different and the music is so good and it is also scared pretty well many times but there also something else than jumpscares.. Alan Wake 2 is a beautiful game from Remedy they build their universe and making a very beautiful masterpiece congratulations to Remedy ️. Well this is a very well done and polished game. It has excellent sound and graphics. You will see wonderful places, listen to some realy good music (not all of them tracks are nice though) and if you own the expansions as well, play a few well executed night springs episodes. On the serious cons though we have a not good character movement and response times of the character are amongst theworst i have ever seen in a AAA game. Believe me this cancerous Mulligan battle left me cursing everywhere and everyone. When you have to be quick in healing or reloading in a fast batle this is ultimate junk. First alan wake was tight. Edit: Further into the game things got even worse. Endless pointless jump scares. You just walking and sound peaks popping faces in your screen. Poor story writing as well. But those jump scares are totaly disapointing.. This game is outstanding! Im a writer and this game resume how a block worx, and the nightmare behind that generates. I think that this game is 10 times better of BG3, and with DLCs is just awesome. Remedy after Control was lacking of titles. But this game is **** amazing and i love it. Reminds me a lot of RE4 days. Masterpace game I love to see Max Payne back in game atmosphere is fantastic in this hame. Ukrainian localization is completely broken, I don't know why Remedy hires this localization team if they don't even understand the basic Ukrainian language. For some reason, even some indie games have resources to add proper localization, so for Remedy it's just a disappointment. The worst part is that this translation spoils the experience of an interesting game.. Absolutely brilliant experience. Game is quite slow paced but brilliant writing which most likely will leave you confused after first playthrough but also will offer more replayability when you tackle the game again and try to uncover what is going on in this multi layered narrative. Combat is mix of Alan Wake Og and RE:remake games. Ultinately this game left me wanting more and I've already played through the game multiple times. This game is must buy enjoy if you enjoy narrative based games and survival horror genre.. Very solid story and universe. A shame the game has not work as expected. Maybe they should have go with physical edition as of the release date to boost sales.. Masterpiece ****, perfect performance and graphic quality Xbox Series X.. I really wanted to like this game, and I did like most of the story. Like every Remedy game, its an atmospheric kind of game, meaning the main storyline itself isn't the best part, but the story told by the environnement and the characters meet is instead. In that sense, Alan wake 2 Is still great and Remedy is still very good for that. While I may have disliked the Theme parkn the rest of the places are great. But two things really piss me off and I am going to rant about them. One is how the sequel either ignore or destroy the characters meet in the first Alan Wake. All the older ones get reduced, Taken, Dementia, whatever make them less relevant. The younger ones, with the only exception of Alice Wake, got removed from the story either before AW2 or just aren't here (Sherif Sarah Breaker and Barry) despite them being very relevants. Like I laugh when people accuse this game of being woke when they removed the fat one and replaced the strong female character by a male one. The second point is toward the gameplay. Remedy, you spend the last 20 years, since the first Max Payne, to make action games.Owning your skill and making each new game a better version of the previous one. Even the original Alan Wake was closer to an action game with horror elements than an actual horror game. Control was easily the best TPS action game I ever played. Then why the F did you decide to throw all of that in the garbage to make instead the most low quality counterfeit of a resident evil game ? Oh, don't get me wrong, I get EXACTLY why you did that. Because the same year control got finished, was released RE2R and was so popular you though making the same game would give you more money. Either you Remedy, or you got your hand forced by Epic. Worse being that the environnment must have been already done at this point because it's painfully obvious that the character gameplay doesn't align with the open environnment. The PC is way too slow, making exploration, one of the main point of the game, a chore. RE solve this problem by making only a world of closed of corridors but yours don't for most of the aeras. Can you even imagine how bad Control would have been if the PC moved as slowly ? Well you get AW2 to show you exactly that. And its not the only bad gameplay decisions of this game. Why aren't the torches refilling and instead being a survival ressource when gun bullets already take that role ? There is no normal enemy that doesn't require you to shoot at it, but there is bosses that require you to only flash them to win, meaning one of them create softlock while the other doesn't. Why isn't there upgrades for said torches like in the original game ? Why making half the secrets to find ressources, when all it does is make you loop losing ressources when you explore to simply get rewarded by getting them back ? And finally, why the investigation board instead of a simple documents menu ? Even more when Saga never guess anything before its explicitly said by other characters, reducing her 'deductions' to repeating things already said in the game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It is a savior in this period when we need quality stories and presentation. A deep and intriguing story is conveyed with a great and different visual style. The switching between characters makes phasing more interesting. The visual quality provides one of the best experiences of the current generation. When all these are blended, Alan Wake II emerges as one of the most important story-oriented games we want to see.. One of the most immersive games ever made. An excellent story and story-telling. The game is handicapped by hardware performance and requirements on PC, combined with bugs. Given that it's a detective game, it is often the case that you don't even realize you're trapped in a bug. Cutscenes often suffer from random muting and stuttering.. Purchased the game and deleted it when forced into negotiating the mood board.. I've been waiting for this sequel for years. The original Alan Wake was more of an arcade-style game than survival horror, but it already worked with incredible narrative concepts that were brilliantly executed in Alan Wake 2. I admit that when I first saw that the game would have a black female protagonist alongside Alan, I was skeptical. To be honest, I believe they added her due to ""woke"" reasons, especially since the original Saga Anderson was white. But to be fair, she's a very well-built character and makes total sense within the game. In fact, her skin color is part of one of the game’s most important answers. I think it’s really annoying when they add an ""inclusive"" character, and they feel out of place, but that’s not the case **** gameplay, in general, follows the style of the Resident Evil 2 remake. The game doesn’t have an abundance of combat, but when it does, it really shines, with some truly tense moments. The main focus of the game is the narrative and how it plays with meta-narratives and different forms of art: games, music, and live-action acting. Let me be a bit arrogant here—I got the main points of the plot on my first playthrough. The game doesn’t hand you the answers on a silver platter, so pay attention. Nothing is said without a reason; everything has a purpose. After finishing it, I watched several playthroughs, and a lot of people didn’t get it, haha. It’s a more complex game, but I didn’t find it that difficult to **** parts with Alan are a highlight. The dystopian New York looks amazing and has the scariest sections, with shadows constantly following you everywhere. There’s an interesting discussion in the game that questions Alan's selfishness, as he involves people he doesn’t even know in his horror stories in an attempt to escape the Dark Place and reunite with his wife, Alice.Well, the game is a masterpiece. It’s a completely ""weird"" game in the best possible way. There’s no other game like it—it’s truly unique, with a heavy atmosphere. And even though I’m not a fan of jumpscares, the game uses them in creative ways. To be honest, I laughed at my own scares several times. One of the best games I’ve ever played.. A masterpiece ****. Sam Lake and everyone working at Remedy deserve way more recognition than they currently get. Shame there was quite a lot of technical issues at launch though (don't know if all of them got fixed by now).. Masterpiece. Story is passionate, characters have great personalities and graphic... Wow. Superb.. Gameplay = 10 Graphic design = 10 Sound = 10 Entertainment = 10 Longevity = 10 Total = 10. Nearly best horror/advanture game ever if we don't mind horrible performance optimization and cheapscary jumpscares. And as an interpret for character Saga, i felt like she had to be less brave and fearless. Supernatural things happening around her but she is too errant.. I played the game for 10 hours and then couldn't finish it. The style and concepts in the game were cool but it tried so hard to be abstract that the story dissolved away. The level design and problem solving were good but the gun play and survival elements were mediocre. Overall, Alan Wake 2 was a game that I wanted like but just didn't enjoy playing.. Really creative and fun experience, cool story and characters. Gameplay enhanced on the BIG flaws of the first installment of the series. Perfect horror game I have ever played GRAPHICS ARE NO JOKE MOREOVER STORY IS PERFECT AND GAME IS VERY HIGHLY POLISHED MUST BUY!. A remarkable piece of art! Surely AAA game that sets the new frontiers in gaming with the brilliant acting, very-well written and super-realistic characters, a whole real Finnish band is acting in a game and playing the soundtrack! Graphics are marvelous, motion artists did the best job here! There is so much creativity in the level design as I have ever seen. Also it is a huge Meta Game for Alan Wake, Control and also now Max Payne game and others. The game I want to explore every door and every corner simply because it is so beautiful. Thank you!. Game was just ok. Some parts are to drawn out and repetitive. Heavy on the jump scares with screen flashes. I actually enjoyed the Saga story line more than Alan Wakes. There is a sprinkle of Sweet Baby Inc.'s racist remark about ""white ****"" that really throws it off for me. So much so that I hateto create an account just to rate this game.. For me it was GOTY. The story, execution (with some small glitches) and the ATMOSPHERE was top notch. One of the best games I have played a long time (TLOU is the benchmark for my taste). Support the guys if you can. Games like these are trully special. Good work guys. Keep it up!. Alan Wake 2 is an outstanding game, and as someone who played the first game as a teenager, I remember being terrified of every ""Taken."" The sequel takes things to a whole new level, truly showcasing Remedy's capabilities. The graphics, environments, and overall quality are absolutely incredible. It sets a new standard for graphical achievements in the gaming industry.There are some genuinely terrifying levels and mind-blowing moments, with the musical level standing out—I'm still humming the Gods of Asgard song! Certain parts of the game are deeply unsettling, and playing with headphones, lights off, and the volume turned up elevated the experience to another level. The jump scares are well-placed, enhancing the tension in just the right **** gameplay itself is solid, with basic but satisfying shooting mechanics. What makes it special is the integration of the Alan Wake world, with iconic items like the flashlight, the clicker, and other unique weapons adding a personal touch to the **** story, however, is the highlight for me. It’s one of the best-written narratives in recent gaming history. The pacing is exceptional, and it truly makes you feel like an investigator, piecing together clues, changing time periods, and solving puzzles by paying close attention. The live-action sequences feel like a Hollywood production and add a lot to the overall experience.I’d highly recommend Alan Wake 2 to any gamer who enjoys a well-crafted story and doesn’t mind some horror along the way!. It’s absolutely a masterpiece, for me. Everything: visuals, levels design, horror moments, music, plot, characters — out of this world. Looking forward to play it in better quality on PS5 pro. One thing that could be fixed: it has some kind of survival aspect to it, and ammo is a bit limited, but enemies respawn right after you leave 50 meters area from them. So at some point I stuck without ammo, because could not find one key, and travelled around the area respawning enemies again and again.. This was my first game in the Alan wake series and while the game was overall a fun experience the game play was very lacking. The games strength was in its story which was very good. I stayed engaged throughout and I actually would have preferred this as a mini series instead ****. While the story was a 10/10 the game play was sub par. It was a very plain shooter copying games like resident evil but with more over used jump scares and no enemy variety and fewer weapons. Basically only worth playing for the story and the music which were both still good enough to make the game an 8/10. If you are looking for a good story this game is for you but if game play is important to you then I’d give this a pass.. As a huge fan of Twin Peaks , al through the years , other Lynch stories , anything involving the woods of North west America and also a fan of the detective attempts in Sunken City.. yes.. I mean the first Alan Wake was a masterpiece for its time , and this is a repeat on that level for this Era. The only difficulty for these Finnish gaming gods will be , what to come up with next . Perhaps go ever deeper down the True Detective / David Lynch rabbit hole and combine it with more different game mechanics , I didn't like Control that much , too simple , too much an action game . 90s Era adventure and tv shows is where this company needs to stay. Keep it X File .. I was gonna put a 7.5/10, but after the ""live rock opera"" level just dropped the game. **** it!. Anticipation is a funny thing because the longer you wait the more likely it is that you'll be disappointed. Like when a band goes on hiatus and then returns years later and it's just not the same, you're different and they are different. You'll always have the memories of when you lined up just right. Alan Wake is unlike any other franchise that I've encountered. I love Alan and his troubles with his darker side. I especially loved his agent Barry. And when the game came to an end and he uttered the now infamous line (go on, you can say it) the love ran deep. It's been 13 years now and I had become convinced he would never get out of the Dark Place but that was okay because I had gotten out of mine. So yes, when Sam Lake was finally able to say Alan Wake 2 confirmed, I can say I was overwhelmed. And that's the word I'd choose now to describe the whole experience of playing Alan Wake 2. It's still incredible to say those words: I've played Alan Wake 2. I could have listed my exact specifications for everything Alan Wake 2 had to do in order to not only be good but to be worthy of my investment in the series. And in the run-up to release I had become worried that I would be disappointed but then it was announced that the Old Gods of Asgard (the fictional counterpart to real life Finish band Poets of the Fall) would return. Check! That was one of the biggest moments, arguably bigger than Sam Lake announcing the game. The other moment for me was actually playing the game for the first time. Remedy drops you in and it's utterly confusing and terrifying. What is this? What's going on? I won't spoil it here but it was overwhelm","the game looks stunning and has a promising atmosphere, but it just falls flat right after the beginning . the story is convoluted and way too derivative of Twin Peaks . the music was amazing, really ties in well with the game ."
486.New Super Mario Bros.,"My first game ever. I am very grateful to this amazing game for introducing me to the world of videogames. Whatever New Super Mario Bros. is my second favourite 2D Mario game. It has a variety of Worlds, a catchy and nostalgic soundtrack, the greatest 2D Mario Bosses and very unique and enjoyable levels. This game is truly the perfect beginner's game. 8,4/10. a great start for a revival series sadly this great series never evolded but only countied doing the exact same thing. A fun return to 2D Mario, although it can be ran through rather quickly if you are skilled. Overlooked, underappreciated.This game, especially in the New Super Mario Bros franchise is really good. Everyone praised Wii for the new mechanics and multiplayer, but I still feel that this game was ****'s worlds and ideas are unique and first for it's time. The gameplay yet simple and digestable, has meat on it's bones. And it comes with the best group of mini games ever.This game both taught me how to burn bowser, and gamble with Luigi.. I have only played Mario on my really old console when I was a kid. Everybody thinks of Mario Bros as a chilling game for kids, or at least that was the mentality of everybody I grew up with. Not really the case. I died lots of times beating this game. I had a lot of fun playing it on my Nintendo 2DS. Every level is different from the others, so there’s enough diversity to keep you entertained. The game can be, as I said, challenging at times and chilling other times. It is a really great and fun platform experience. And as a bonus, there's also the mini-games that are quite fun.. This may come as a surprise to some, but I wasn't particularly shocked by this game. It's good, I'm not saying it isn't, but I think it's a step down from Mario Bros on the WII. I didn't like the fact that you had to find hidden exits to explore all the worlds. I get the impression that the game wants me to finish it as quickly as possible, but I'm not a speedrunner, I want to enjoy my game time, not hurry at all costs.. Best of its series as it actually innovated. Besides that its a very fun platformer, and I highly suggest playing this instead of the slop that followed it. Except New Super Mario Bros. 2 that one is actually good.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Mario VS Luigi: Dawn Of Justice It started with me and my friend wanting a fun game to play, ending in a hit and run. When I first played this game on lockdown I didn't think much of it but when I played the game it was enjoyable all the worlds are fun and most of them are easy. If you have a ds somewhere around your house go play the game to have a good time. Also a very solid Mario game but why is it so difficult at times, I mean Mario Bros Wii is childsplay compared to this. Maybe i am just bad.. Easily one of my most-played and forever-cherished DS gaming experiences. I can practically beat the game in a couple hours by remembering all of the secret locations and warps. The main story is fun, challenging, easy enough to learn, and always fun to revisit. And I spent plenty of time in the minigames too; I remember countless moments on the school bus playing with a friend over DS download. It was really fun to 100% the game again a decade later after fixing my old DSi!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The first and real new of the series. Whit this game nintendo expressed all of her originality whit original bosses, original worlds and original music. This game introduced all the 3d mechanics into the 2d platform series, like the groundpound or the wall jump. This game also introduces a very fun multiplayer mode. Even whit the stereotype that the ''new'' series has lost its originality this game still have it and for me it's the best game in the ""new"" series.. Revitalized the 2D Mario series by putting a ""modern"" twist on the classics. Adding some of the 3D Mario move set to the game added a lot more fun to the platforming, though most of the other new additions felt too gimmicky (not Monty Tank though that guy is cool).. It might've been revolutionary for it's time, but today it's just another Mario game.. New Super Mario Bros is one of the best video games in the Super Mario saga in my opinion, and the best of the ""New"" line. The levels are very varied and the bosses are quite original. It plays with a very good fluidity even for the time.. Amazing game, just really hated the stupid shy guy mini game.. To much world and secrets exits. Do it 100% is hard work.. banger game, the clones on other consoles are bad. It has gambling mini game, so automatic 10/10.. Great game, it's basically a DS version of Super Mario Bros but with upgraded graphics and minigames. It's a little easier than the classic ones but I still really like this game.. New Super Mario Bros. is a fresh interpretation of the classic Mario Bros. series that preserves old strengths and adds new touches. The game shines with creative-level design and original power-ups that provide a lot of variety. With 80 new levels and 18 new mini-games, the title offers some content, but it could have been a bit more. Some criticisms are also the too easy difficulty and the short playing time. Nevertheless, New Super Mario Bros. is a great new take, which laid the foundation for newer games of the series!. This is one of the best games on the DS system no joke. This game has such cool bosses comapred to the basic ass koopalings thay ate used in every game after Super Mario World. Easy 10/10 becuase thos game introdiced 2 of the greatest power ups ever to exist.. best 2d mario game around‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎. This game is literally perfect. It revived 2D Mario and it did it well by making the game look and feel fresh with all the new level mechanics, secrets, controls, and they even implemented some 3D Mario abilities in the game to make it feel more modern aswell such as the walljump, double and triple jumps, ground pound, etc, new powerups, new and unique bosses, and the 3D Mario abilities aren't just slapped in they were used to make brand new and unique levels that are required for you to use these abilities. The only problems with this game is the mid tower boss is exactly the same throughout all the worlds all you do is fight bowser jr and he slowly gains more abilities as you progress, the final boss ****, and it created a who series with this ""New"" brand that completely killed 2D Mario because of how bad the later games are like New Super Mario Bros 2 and U good thing Super Mario Wonder will revive 2D Mario again. Lets just hope they don't milk it dry like they did with the ""New"" series.. This game isn't bad by any means, but it really doesn't live up to the standard set by pretty much every 2D Mario game that came before it. It lacks the wacky creativity of Super Mario Bros. 3, the sense of wonder and adventure in Super Mario World, the originality of Super Mario Bros. 2 (which is still a great game despite being not originally being a Mario game), and the groundbreaking innovation of the original Super Mario Bros. This game has some new ideas, but a lot of them are wasted by being severely underutilized. Take the Mega Mushroom, for example. It seems like the game was designed around this power-up for a few levels in the beginning, and then they just kinda forgot about it after that. The mini mushroom is good for some secrets but that's about it. The blue shell is admittedly pretty fun, and probably the best and most unique aspect of the game. But compared to the Tanooki suit or the cape, it feels quite unessential to the game experience. The level design is nothing too special most of the time, and nothing really sticks out in my memory. I did enjoy the two hidden worlds as a concept, but i found their levels to mostly be just ok. The mini-games are definitely a fun time-waster, and it is honestly probably the part of the game that has the most replay value. Overall, I found this game to be decent, but not up to snuff with the prior entries in line of 2D Mario games.. It's alright i guess the controls are good and the levels look cool, i like that this game has unique bosses and not just the koopa kids. But the game feels a bit too easy and it's not really too memorable. Prettified reboot of the classic games that doesn't quite have the edge and inventiveness of its SNES forebears, but is a pleasing little platformer in its own right.. A real great game for a mario renew, a lot of elements will remember classic games, the giant mushroom makes it kinda too much easy (i literally defeated bowser in seconds without taking damage using it), all said, it's still a must-play DS game.. Perfect DS-Game and probably the best of the New Super Mario Bros. series. It has unique bosses and a diverse level design. It captures the feeling of the classic games while staying „new“. A very simplistic but fun experience. This game is a good one but after you beat it, it'll just be an ok game. Nothing more, nothing less. New super Mario bros is a great experience for the series as Mario is saving princess peach a simple plot and it's gets better this game They remade the Mario series in a amazing way to get Mario fans really happy the levels are incredible the graphics are great too look at and the gimmicks are good and the bosses are impressive one of my favorite 2d games. Not really much wrong with this game. All the levels are amazing although I do find the water levels most boring. The ship and castle levels are probably the most fun. The variety of levels make this game amazing. The variety of enemies if also impressive. Bowsers castle is also an amazing level. It's just an iconic game that has so many amazing levels to play.. The best experience the New Super Mario series can offer. On top of unique levels with little empty space, there a bunch of side modes that give the game extra value. Star Coins are a well designed collectible, as are most of the secret exits; though the game does occasionally get pretty specific and obscure with a few of its secrets.. This game basically made my childhood. Great in terms of gameplay and graphics, would recommend to a Super Mario fan.. This was one of the first games I ever owned as child and I can remember the smile on my face when i unwrapped it on Christmas day 2010 and it never disappointed. The level design is amazing and the best in the 2D series. This game is a masterpiece, there's no doubt about that. The multi player is soo good in this game as well. I used to play it all the time with my older sister and my friends and created some really great memories. The graphics, for a ds game, were great. 10/10.. An amazing Nintendo DS classic. Like any Mario game, you will find yourself coming back here.. (8.5/10) - I can't remember if I ever beat this one but I remember playing this all the time. The minigames and re-done soundtrack are highlights.. Multiplayer Is Top Notch, Music Is Nostalgic, New Super Mario Bros Is A Masterpiece! Story Is Simple. There Is Thunder In Peach's Castle, Mario Checks It Out, Bowser Junior Kidnaps Peach. Controls Are Very Good! Just Like Super Mario World (1991) But With The Wall Jump, And Ground Pound From Super Mario 64 (1996) You Will Be Running, Jumping And Sometimes Climbing In This Exiting Platformer, Buy It, Its Very Good! This Game Gets A 9/10. A lot of people say that New Super Mario Bros, turned what’s old new, and then old again. This was when it was new. At this point, there was no 2d Mario for 14 years. The last one could barely play in color. But this one, is a gem. It has the same story it’s always had, which wasn’t so bad back then, but it’s not good now. Story doesn’t mean a ton in a platformer, though. The new gimmicks are lots of fun. The mega mushroom is an utter blast, the mini mushroom is the worst power-up ever created, and the blue shell is the best power-up ever created. Water levels are still bad though, and mansions aren’t much better. That’s just how it is. Each level tries to do something new, and usually succeeds at doing that. The bosses can be hard, but are very creative. Mummipokey is fun to say, but also difficult and fun. There are 2 other game modes: Mario vs. Luigi and mini games. Mario and Luigi pits Mario and Luigi (by the way, you can play as Luigi normally by holding L and R and pressing A when selecting a file) and they have to get stars. It’s a lot of fun when you can play it, but by now you can’t. Mini games use the touchscreen and are “oodles of fun”. They’re even funnier with friends. I learned to play Poker from it. This game is utter gold and probably my favorite DS game. It’s so sad to see New Super Mario Bros as the platforming series which will never change, but this was a good beginning for it.. great level design, the best handheld platform game ever made. its a mario game, what do you expect. it's a good platformer i love it a classic mario game for all ages it has fun levels and powerups. This game deserves to be counted as one of the great 2D Mario games, up with Super Mario Bros. Super Mario Bros. 3, and Super Mario World. It gets a lot of undeserved hate, simply because of it being a ""New"" Super Mario Bros. title, but this was a really great game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. graphics are really good for nintendo ds, the gameplay is smooth, the difficulty level is balanced, i like it, it's not as difficult as mario bros nes which is really hard to finish. This is a great game, despite what anyone may say about the New Super Mario Bros. series. The levels are phenomenal, and there's just enough collectibles to keep you playing for a while. It does get pretty difficult at times, but it is just difficult enough. I would recommend this to anyone who owns a DS.. This was the start of the New Super Mario Bros series, and back when it was actually “new”! It re-invented 2D Mario platformers after so long and did a stellar job at it! The core gameplay is great and brings in some moves from 3D Mario games like the ground pound and triple jump, which worked super well here! The levels are fun to play through, with the traditional grass, desert, water, forest, snow, rock, sky and volcano themes for each world. The overworlds could have been a bit better and not as linear as they are. The main bosses are all very creative and interesting, including Mummy Pokey, Lakithunder, Mega Goomba, Petey Piranha and a few more. There were some cool ideas for new powerups. We got the Mega Mushroom which lets you smash anything in your path and it’s super satisfying, the blue Koopa shell which is fun to slide around in, and the mini mushroom which makes you tiny and is only good for certain levels. The graphics are a bit too pixelated and outdated, but it’s still an upgrade from previous 2D Mario platformers. The soundtrack is pretty good but I wish there were more world specific themes because the default athletic theme gets repetitive as you progress. In Mario vs Luigi, you connect to someone else’s DS and battle it out to collect the most stars. This mode is kinda dated now but it was fun at the time the DS was still alive! The minigame mode returns from Super Mario 64 DS with mostly the same ones, but some new ones included. This is still the most unique out of the New Super Mario Bros games to this day. It’s a great game but of course, it sold so well that it caused the series to get stale afterwards.. New super Mario bros. DS, a return to the Mario 2d platforming series. The game starts out really strong with well design levels catchy music that fits the tone and a fresh start to a new Mario franchise. playing further into the game the levels become either more boring or have not very fun gimmicks. For example the snake block levels felt slow but also unfair. I still have fun with the rest of the game but it felt very ""OK"" after the first few worlds. the music became repetitive because it is always bubbly which was fine in the first world but the other worlds songs have the same vibe. This makes the worlds feel less unique. Also the bosses get a little repetitive besides the castle ones which I enjoy but I don't like battling bowser jr. 20 times. on to a high note the levels are for the most part designed very well. This game was made to be played single player which allowed it to try things that you couldn't do in the Wii version. one thing I have mixed feelings about is the new powerups. the mini mushroom is fun to use but doesn't show up much and is only used for secrets. The blue shell I absolutely hate it has killed me more than helped and lastly the mega mushroom is cool the first time but a little underwhelming every other time I use it. Also the fire flower feels as good as ever in this game and added some quality of life changes such as fireballs being able to go up stairs which I like. It might seem like I disliked this game but I actually enjoyed playing through it. It seems like a fun game to play on a road trip or to just pop it in and finish a world. which is why im going to give is a 6/10 (good). A fun platform we with great new ideas sure this series has been done to death but this game is enjoy. my first ever game on the DS! quite fun and it was a lot harder than i expected. mario's slippery mechanics took me a while to get used to. the bosses are trivially easy if you bring a fire flower with you. the rng on some of the levels like the meteor one was annoying. nice platformer which introduced me to mario. I love this game. New levels, worlds and power ups. Mini-games is good too. But world 8 is TOO hard. I don't play multiplayer, so I won't write about it.. The Best game you could get for a Nintendo Ds, New Super Mario Bros DS has modes that others don't have. I loved the Mario vs Luigi mode, and also some of the minigames. The levels are creative, some are unique, and of course new items like mega/mini mushroom, blue shell is fun to use with. If you want to get started on platforming, start with this one.. Good - graphics are good for the ds - a lot of rehashed platforming from SMB and smw series. There are some new twists and platforming obstacles as well. Bad - only firefire power up. Mega mushroom is kinda boring. Shell power is useless. Mini mushroom is interesting but not enough of it. - the wall jump distance is inconsistent with the running speed. - I should be allowed to save any time in the overworld, not only between castles. - boss fights were repetitive. And not creative.. Great game. Actual bosses, cool secrets, fun power ups. all the others, while fun at times, are pretty corporate in their design and execution. It's just boring at times.. I just love this game, is just fun and I have many good memories related to this game.. Brilliant game! It's clearly the best game of the series and it's a classic. Nice music and lovely level design.. This is one of the best 2D games ever. The level design, the length, the music, the power ups, the multiplayer. If you want to play a 2D Mario game, this is a must play.. This game is almost perfect. The level design is awesome. The enemies make the levels indistinguishable from each other. Even the bosses are great (even though they're too easy to defeat). What's the problem? The new powerups. The Mega Mushroom is a bit messy. It is not designed for every level (sometimes you might just stuck somewhere, where you have to wait until the effect ends). Mini Mushroom is just annoying. You cannot know where you have to use it. And it's a rare power up, so if you want it, you just have to repeat the level 1-4, where you surely get it. The shell is... ok, I guess, but let's just talk about it as a bonus power up, that is needed like 4 times in the game... other than this, the game is perfect. Multiplayer is fun, too.. This game was another childhood staple of mine. I will admit I like it a little less than I once did tho.. I spent so much time on this as a kid. I decided to play it again before reviewing as to not let nostalgia take over. What can I say, the game holds up!. I don't have nostalgia for this one, but I feel the Wii U and Wii ones are just better. Sorry.. Amazing levels, unique characters and beautiful graphics for a ds game. It still holds up the test of time even to this day. Really enjoyable and controls very well.. remember when i said new super mario bros wii was my favorite new series game? yeah this is second place but this started when of the worst series for me. Gameplay: 8, Graphics: 7, Varierty: 7. One of the frist platforming game i've played, it's quite hard to me, but i have fun memories with it although there aren't a lot of variety here. This, bar none, is my favorite game of all time. It may be just nostalgia, but New Super Mario Bros introduced me to video games and I owe it the world for that. It also has great multiplayer.. A great return to the classics with interesting new powerups and an intriguing level design that makes for a fun end enjoyable game all the way through. The multiplayer is fantastic, and the minigames are fun and addicting. Definitely the best of all of the New Super Mario Bros. games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. New Super Mario Bros is a fun game. It's nothing special, but it's fun. I'm not a HUGE fan of 2D Mario (Unless it has World in the title) and this one is no different. I think it's better than all the rest of the so called *New* Mario games (except for maybe Wii). I will say the bosses were all original and unique, which is something that the rest of the 2D Mario games have completely ignored. I really don't have any complaints, or anything that blew me away. it's a good game , but forgettable. I would overall give it a B-.. Surely Recommended If You Need A 3DS Game But Only Have 10 Pounds If You Want Do Have A Good Mario Game With No Reused Stage Layouts. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Classic mario game in classic NDS era with clsssic fun. The game also has a good replay value with your friend thanks to the multiplayer modes.. This game is a absolutely classic, and envelops well the magic of both 2D Mario and the Nintendo DS alike. This should be in every Nintendo DS, and its a great fun in your pocket. Sadly its a bit repetitive, easy and the final levels are poorly designed, but overall its a solid game.. This game is so good, the levels are very creative and interesting, the multiplayer and the mini games are so funny and I think this is one of the best ds games. If you own a DS and need a quick, accessible and fun adventure, this is the game for you. It's charming levels and worlds mix for a fun experience along with collectibles that enhance the satisfaction of completing the game fully. The extras that add on to this game is what adds to the fun and charm of this mildly long adventure. My Review: Between 7.4 and 8. this game is good to this day i love the minigames and it has multiplayer vs mode and multiplayer minigames. The return of the 2d mario platformers is a very underrated game. I think this is due to the overload of 'New' Super Mario Bros games in recent years. If you (somehow) forget all of those and the legacy they created, this games is really enjoyable. I think the artisic choice works, especially for this game being a handheld platformer. The level design could provide a bit more challenge, but in saying that there are some tough levels as the game goes on. The soundtrack is the best in the 'new' series and had an original feel before the other 'new' games came out - the bowsers castle/boss theme song is an underrated gem. It also had some fantastic, memorable minigames and multiplayer modes which really gave this game some more life and worth. So, even though this game isn't as good as past 2d Mario platformers such as Mario bros 3 and Mario world, it still holds up today and is a great purchase for the DS system. [OBJECTIVE QUALITY REVIEW] This reiteration of Mario into 2d isn't a BAD one and thus isn't a BAD game, by any means, but even though it was impressive for its time especially when then compared to later entries of essentially the same name, this is still slightly disappointing and lacking somewhat in content when we actually stop and question the game itself. It is impressive that a new Powerups were introduced into the game - especially those as the Mega and Mini Mushrooms that certainly allowed players to alter the experience in a fun and exciting way, and let's not forget the Koopa Shell Powerup that allows for Koopa Shell-style movement across the levels as well as pummeling enemies and breaking down obstacles along the way - but although there are certainly more new power ups than in later titles, there wasn't actually that many powerups to go off of, and that in itself is disappointing for some players who would've loved to have a large variety of powerups at their arsenal. The levels are unsatisfyingly generic even for what it was at the time; I actually found myself getting bored at times, more often than not in fact, just trying to push through the levels that don't really have that much variety in them anyway. The controls are also a bit shoddy and slippery even for its game theme; these controls, along with more questionable enemy hitboxes, actually goes as far as making combo stomping much more difficult, especially on an emulator where gameplay is slow, than previous Mario titles, where it was relatively easy to a degree if not easily executed. The soundtrack, however, is actually quite strong even for what the sub-series is now; some of the tracks are very melodic, and the graphics are also quite strong even for the limited hardware of the DS, especially with the true 2d sprites, which some are actually very colorful and beautiful, unlike the next installment NSMBW, which actually had somewhat questionable/ugly graphics. Overall, more, especially much more, could've been put into the design of the game as a whole, especially being New Super Mario Bros. That's not to say, however, that it needed much improvement much less was a bad game in any way at all; the game actually fulfills its bare minimum requirements for that New Super Mario Bros.-gamestyle quota, but it could've easily used more, and again, especially much more, with better, more fun and exciting level design, probably more powerups, tighter and thus and otherwise better controls, and an overall more fun experience. As one of two last notes, although the wireless multiplayer would be fun in theory and still actually can be, this is weighed down by the mediocre level design, and along with all its other problems, would actually make the multiplayer little to not satisfying, and your partner would likely quit after only a short time if they were in the same position as me, due to boredom or something else. Personally, the game was only slightly satisfying for me, and would get a lower to mid mixed rating at best. I've experienced some of if not all the same problems with gameplay fun as the objective review exhibits, and although this personally would get a decent rating, this is only a mediocre title that, while quite well executed, had fully plenty of room for improvement and could've used a lot more in the long run, especially with the later titles getting even fewer over time. What a crying shame for what was genuinely once quite a fun, diverse franchise.. Music: 4/5 Game Play: 4.5/5 Graphics: 5/5 Story: ???/5 Time-Value: 5/5 Overall:4.5/5. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The New Super Mario Bros DS is a very good game, about the steps, about the puzzles to get the big coins, about the new power-ups, those are so goods and innovate a lot and about the enemies. But I didn't like so much some points of the game, like the duration, the game is too short, even if you get all big coins and play all the worlds. Other ""bad"" point about the game is the innovation in the movement points, I wish the game innovated about the movements with new ones.. This was easily the best NSMB. It is actually innovative, unlike the rest. (That doesn't mean they are necessarily bad, though.) There are so many ways to play the game, several worlds being completely optional. Plus, Star Coins actually have a use. Apart from the base game, there is also the BEST Two-Player versus mode, and it also has the minigames from Super Mario 64 DS! NSMB is one of the best DS games you can get, and I have had a great time with it.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Truly a spectacular game and a big leap forward for platformers. Rating - 87%. This has got to be the best 2D Mario game ever made. The levels are well designed. The bosses aren't just ""hit a turtle on the head three times and win"" like the other New Super Mario Bros games. All the bosses (besides Bowser) are really fun to fight, not to mention pretty original. The soundtrack is one of the best in the entire Mario series, especially the final boss and castle music. Overall, New Super Mario Bros is easily the best 2D Mario game I've ever played.. New Meets Old New Super Mario Bros Is An Extremely Unique Game Because Of It.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I played this a lot in my younger days, and if it was as popular as ocarina of time back in 98 it would certainly be remembered just as fondly. The visual charm/aesthetic are unique compared to smb 1 2 and 3. It doesn't change the core Mario game but the new gameplay features and abilities like ground pound, sliding (which were exclusive to 3d mario) and new power ups are great. I would say that although the platforming and level design is great, combat is a little easy and boring. The level design is not quite as good as SM 3 or World. Excellent game overall. This is really the best Mario game I've ever played. Innovative level design and themes, the right amount of challenge, many things to unlock by spending Star Coins, the multiplayer is super, and if all that wasn't enough, the F**KING MINIGAMES!. I Love this game. It was the return to the 2-d mario games and is as solid as mario world. It has good graphics, great music and most of all great levels. I do not recall a single time where I got bored with this game because it was that fun. But I have two problems with this game. 1. Is that the game is too easy and 2. if you want to go to world 4 and 7 you have to be mini mario. Which is one of the worst powerups in the game. And so are all of the powerups like the shell. You need to run and you curl in a ball and it ****. And this game spawned 3 other games just like it. But like it because it is fun. And it gets 8/10. this game is the first game I've ever played and I have insane memories with it I love this game and it and the company will always stay with my heart. Every day before I got SM64DS I would play it every weekend and try my hardest to get through every level, but is it as good as I remember it? Pros: + Gameplay: It's basic SMB gameplay modernized, and it's fun. + Level Design: While the worlds did feel long, the levels were fun and had some variety within them. + Collectables: Star Coins were pretty great and had actual uses, unlike Yoshi Coins in Mario Worlds. + Difficulty: While it's far on the easy side, it still offers a lot of challenge in the game (especially in the hidden challenge mode). Cons: - Enemy Variety: It's just Goombas, Koopas, Bullet Bills, Dry Bones, and Wigglers. Overall, New Super Mario Bros., which was actually my first video game, is my favorite 2D Mario game and warrants a 9.3/10.. This is one of the best mario bros games and ds games and this is a comback to the old 2d games this game is very fun. A 'reinvention' of the traditional Mario platformer on the DS. It has gameplay that is both addicting and easily approachable, whether you are a long time fan of Super Mario or not. However","a fun return to 2D Mario, although it can be ran through rather quickly if you are skilled . the gameplay yet simple and digestable, has meat on it's bones . it comes with the best group of mini games ever ."
487.Silent Hill 2 (2001),"This is the best game of all time, the best story game I have ever seen, if my memory was erased the first thing I would finish is Silent Hill 2 yes this is the best Silent Hill I have ever played even the remake was awesome, the strange thing about the game is not in the game itself but the rating imagine Resident Evil Code Veronica got a higher rating than Silent Hill 2, Resident Evil Code Veronica is a nice part but not at the level of Silent Hill I mean in Resident Evil the character cannot put a mark on the map okay now how do I remember the location of the puzzle or the missing piece something not at the level of Silent Hill I mean all the characters in Silent Hill put a mark on the map like this place is closed here there is a symbol of simple movements but very important and influential. Masterpiece. Also it's scary but has just the right amount of jumpscares. This is how all horror games should be. Psychological horror is the best kind.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Reading some reviews made me realize why they don't make games like this anymore today.Nowadays,gamers are alarmingly stupid.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. best game in horror genre, best atmosphere and music.music and characters details a phenomenal! 10/10. In my opinion its one of the best games I have ever played i love everything about it, specially the story. For me its the best silent hill game. the story is great, kinda tedious to play though, alot of clunky controls throughout, which im not a fan of.... Gameplay - 7 / Graphics - 9 / Performance - 10 / Sound - 10 / Story - 10 / ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ. This game is dumb. Graphics are bad, controls are bad, and enemies aren't scary. Right from the jump you have to do everything in a linear order or important objects don't appear for you. Trying to solve a puzzle? Oh wait, important parts are missing unless you did A, B, and C in a specific order. It's artificial difficulty and I'm not enjoying a stupid linear game with bad voice acting that I have to wander around to trigger specific cut scenes in a specific order to progress or look at a guide. Play Resident Evil. Any Resident Evil over this.. One of the greatest, best written games ever made. More than just a video game, it's an experience everyone should give a try.. One of the best games that I ever played period. Also story is probably the best one that I ever played.. A masterpiece from a different time that still holds up today. Excellent music, story and horror all put into a great horror game.. Silent Hill 2 is arguably the best psychological horror game to ever grace the gaming landscape. Harrowing, tense, and dripping in an atmosphere of existential dread and trauma, our second trip to the titular town plays host to a variety of heartbreaking stories that are as honest as they are painful. The series’s signature blend of scrappy, clunky combat and riddle-infused puzzles creates a strange addiction to exploration that is rewarded and punished in equal measure. Overall, Silent Hill 2 is a classic of a bygone era that richly revels in regret and the very human tendency to get ourselves stuck in cycles of self-destruction. It’s terrific, thrilling, and my only real negative note would be over how darn difficult it is for casual gamers to access and experience, especially as a sequel that outshines its predecessor by miles.. I played this game until the hospital part. I did'nt finish but for a 2001 game is good,i hate horror puzzle games but this is different. THIS IS A F*CKING 2001 GAME, the fog is so aesthetic. Simply put. A masterpiece **** in metaphor. Silent Hill 2 is an all time classic and an unforgettable title.. This game is pure perfection that never needed any ""modernization for the masses"".This game defends itself to this day with everything (from the brilliant dreamlike atmosphere to the ending ""In Water"" which is the most canonical.A game that IS the best psychological horror in the gaming industry, similar to The Shining in the film industry.. One of the greatest videogame of all time there is nothing else to say about it, just play it if you haven't already.. Best game I have ever played. Ever. It is a master class in Survival Horror.. Silent Hill 2 is one of the greatest horror game and my favorite for good reason. The atmosphere is amazing, the foggy town is eerie and disturbing, while otherworld sections are dirty and uncomfortable. The acting is weird but in a good way. It’s uncanny and adds to the unsettling nature of the game. The graphics aren’t too bad by today’s standards and gives another layer of uncanniness to this game. My main complaint is combat, it’s a bit clunky, but I can ignore it for the most part. The game is amazing and should be played by everyone at least once.. Such a Horror masterpiece I love the protagonist everything about this game was perfect. If the remake is like this, then I’m in it.. A masterpiece. The visual design combined with the haunting sounds create an unmatched atmosphere, same goes for story and characters. Also it is one of the very rare games with well made puzzles. No other game regardless of genre comes close to this one. It is just outstanding.. no words to describe the history of this game, no words to describe the feels you get in certain parts. One of the best survival horror games of all time. A classic. If you haven't played it yet,what are you waiting for? Oh yeah the remake? hope it capture the original! Big shoes to fill.. This is the best game of all time. There is nothing else to say except one thing, WOW. Silent Hill 2 is a great horror video game. It's not the scariest one in the franchise, but it has the best storytelling, disturbing enemy designs, a great atmosphere, and a great score & **** the combat system and camera angles feel so dated at this time, anyway...Team Silent did a great job. Let's see what happens with Bloober Team's remake. Score: 8.7/10. This game is perfect in every aspect, the way it uses symbolism to explain a deep and difficult situation is amazing and it has the best plot twist i have seen in a while.. This game is a masterpiece. It has quite everything for an horror game: ambience, atmosphere, music, lore, characters, tricky puzzle games, claustrophobic rooms and buildings and so on. One principal mess: the clunky gameplay, especially during the bosses. However, especially for those who are into narratives games, it is still playable and enjoyable. I would anyway recommend it to anyone! This game is a huge experience, like reading a good book that will remain in your heart forever <3. It's Silent Hill 2.. This is my personal favorite game of all time across all genres and console generations. No need to go into detail :) Final Rating: 99/100. Improved basically everything possible from the previous game. Brilliant in all aspects.. One word. Overrated. I’ve been playing survival horror games since the beginning. Everyone talks about how great this game is. I can’t disagree more. Even by PS2 standards, the graphics are horrific. The fog is not scary or creepy, it’s an excuse not to have a real town. The buildings are all the same and almost all are unexplorable. The voice acting makes RE1 look like King Lear. The monsters are all the same and there is NOTHING frightening about the stupid radio, it is only annoying. Here’s hoping the remake can at least keep me awake. This series can’t shine Resident Evil’s shoes . Just one person’s opinion .. EN- The gameplay is still wonderfull even in 2024, the athmosphere is realy crazy. Story, cimematics and musics are incredible. A REAL MUST-PLAY. FR- Le gameplay est toujours excellent même en 2024, l'ambiance est complètement dingue. L'histoire, les cinematiques et musiques sont incroyables. UN VRAI MUST-PLAY.. The smartest story telling ever on a horror game. Every element makes perfect sense and has a meaning, its just amazing how team silent created such a perfect piece with so little amount of resources.. Genuinely one of the most moving narratives in a video game, filled with genuine room for lots of player interpretation. Coupled with one of the greatest soundtracks in Gaming. Brought down slightly by some poor combat mechanics, abysmal ""bossfights"" (if theycan even be called that) and some frustrating puzzle design.. Protagonist James Sunderland receives a letter from his wife asking him to meet her at their favorite place, Silent **** problem is that his wife has been dead for 3 years.What surprised me about the game, besides the great story of two young people, James & his wife, is it's use of a masterfully crafted atmosphere being used to unnerve the player rather than relying on cheap tricks like jumpscares.Symbolism, anxiety, dread, sexual frustration and an endless wave of fog are what surround James as he tries to discover how it could be possible for his dead wife to be writing him a letter. Why doesn't he dismiss it? There is no way for his wife that passed from a terminal illness to really be at Silent Hill. Could she really be there?He does eventually meet a person heavily resembling his wife but he is convinced it isn't **** never ending fog James is seeing constantly is something of a PlayStation 2 limitation to help with the render distance but as it happens in all forms of art, working with limitations creates boundless imagination.There is something beyond the fog that James doesn't **** James a reliable narrator? He sees monsters that others don't see. The woman he meets that resembles his wife even has a name similar to his wife's and yet it isn't her.Only the player can eventually see clearly into the fuzziness that occupies James' head. As he delves deeper into his own mystery, he finds out things about himself and his marriage that he doesn't like.What's so special about the town of Silent Hill?Only one way to find out. Step into the fog.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. At first, I didn’t expect much from this game. After all, it’s just a 2001 game with terrible combat and “masterfull” voice acting. However, what I got is an elite story with one of the most tragic main character. All the monsters reflect traumas of the characters (I find Angela as one of the most interesting characters) and when I beat this game, I realised that the true horror lies inside of these disturbed individuals.. Always liked the game and watched it for many years. Now I got the chance to play it and I can say it is 100% in my top 5 games oat. The story, atmosphere, soundtrack, writing, characters, pacing, ending and more are 10/10. It is by a mile the best horror game of all time. Dude, just one of the best games I've ever played in my life. It's a masterpiece, I remember myself getting scared a lot by this game getting confused, sad, regret,I felt everything I needed to.. One of the best games ever. It shows its age a little, but it is still a haunting experience.. ""Silent Hill 2"" is a survival horror masterpiece. It's the best entry in the series. If I could use ONE word to describe this game, it would be ""haunting"". The tone is surreal, the story is sad and the characters are strange. Unfortunately, the combat is clunky, but the storytelling and atmosphere are the reasons why you play ""Silent Hill"". While this isn't a perfect game, it's still a great one. I would rate it with a 9.1 out of 10.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What a horror masterpiece created by the glorious Konami. The gameplay isn't that good, but tye story about every character and pacing of the game it's just perfect, 10/10. This is a horror masterpiece! The atmosphere (music, artstyle) and the story are admirable. The game mechanics are a bit clunky.. I remember playing this as a kid and being absolutely terrified. Its soundtrack is still one of my favorites today. Having just replayed it, it is less scary and the terrible voice acting takes you out of the game a bit, but back in the PS2 era this was, with Resident Evil, the best horror game. The story and themes are still shocking today and I wish more games would tackle such mature subjects. We can only hope the remake will do it justice but by expectations are unfortunately very low.. A work of art. Influential and sad. Every-horror tittle wants to be Silent Hill 2 — not many video game narratives deal with anything this adult/mature with so much care and compassion. A Unique experience that is on that level of elevating video-game as modern art pieces.. This best game ever play in the ps2. Silent Hill was a game ahead of its time, and Silent Hill 2 builds on every one of its predecessor's qualities to make this one of the greatest horror games ever made. Silent Hill 2 is a chilling experience, with one of gaming's most finely crafted narratives and an iconic soundtrack.. Wasn't very silent. Great game the story is amazing and some people going to say the gameplay just but it 2D style. One of my favorites of all time, I keep going back to it (watching someone play it, watching videos about new discoveries, listening to it's OST) from time to time, non-stop for the last 20 years.. ITS A MASTERPIECE OF TRAGIC , PSYCHOHORROR and FRUSTRACION!! This is for me Game of The Year all Time. In my restless dreams I see that town. Silent Hill. You promised you'd take me there again someday, but you never did. Well, I'm alone there now, in our special place, waiting for you. A beautiful and sad psychological horror, one of the best PS2 games with one of the best scenarios. The realistic theme weighs heavily on the player, and the city, enemies, and direction are all intertwined with the main storyline, adding depth to the story through their synergy, which is what makes Silent Hill 2 a masterpiece. Although it is called ""Silent Hill 2,"" the story is independent except for the setting related to the town of Silent Hill, which is not a problem at all. The story is similar to Final Fantasy 10, although the gameplay and genre are completely different. The truth about Mary is revealed as you follow a letter from her dead wife, Mary, with the clear objective of searching Silent Hill for her. This is James' story of redemption. Those of you who make it to the end will surely be moved to tears.. Idk who really likes this game. I heard that is a good horror game, A game with gameplay like: Find a **** in giant location and this not marked on map. After that go back to your first location and on your way a millions of cockroach will enrage you. I dropped the game after i find a girl with knife because i didn't want to seek a 5 items for finishing a puzzle. I can't imagine enjoy this even a ten years ago. Graphics not bad but gameplay is just unreal **** And the last. I'm never get scared at this game. A whole game is just raging me with his gameplay. P.S. I tried to play it again and now im at boat location. Actually after first location this game is not so bad! First location is piece of sh it but after that this game become more interesting and fun! ( But fighting mechanics is still bad /: ) Story becomes more interesting every minute. Fun story: In hospital location after pyramid head hitted me on the roof i lost Maria. I thought someone kidnapped her. But actually i was entering wrong door whole time XD. After i finish the game i'll gonna edit this review. Also i have some sort of problem with items. Some of them is invisible. Maybe this is a issue of emulator but this is really makes game hard. This forcing me to press X button at every empty desk. (Music is really nice) P.S.S Finished the game... This is **** story masterpiece. I never maded so big mistake... I never played game like this... I'd liked to set 10/10 but gameplay and fighting is pretty bad. **** i watched again a intro in menu and this is contains more meaning and hints. And you understanding this only after completing a game... Hiroyuki Owaku you genious,. This game is one of the best psycological horror that I have ever played. Simply art! No more words need to be said, since its a landmark in horror of the 2000s. One of the best games in the genre of psychological horror. One of the best games in my personal rating in principle. It is not boring to play even in 2023. I look forward to the remake, I hope its creators will not let down the expectations of fans of this wonderful series of games.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Players assume the role of James, who receives a cryptic letter from his wife (who has been dead for 3 years) beckoning him to meet her in Silent Hill, a place that holds great meaning for the couple. The mystery of the letter compels him to return to the surreal horror and all-too-real danger in Silent Hill. Silent Hill 2 is the pinnacle of the series. It's a bizarre and haunting horror masterpiece. And yes, it's even better than the first game. Graphically, it ranks up with Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Xbox's Splinter Cell. This is a must play for fans of the spooky stuff. I would rate it with a 9.1 out of 10.. This game does have its flaws, that being said, the game is so good that the flaws are actually good.. I have no clue what to say about silent hill 2. it was probably the best horror game I've ever played. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It improves the atmosphere of terror of the first Silent Hill and accompanies it with a story that shows us that the greatest terror is not the fictional monsters, but the real problems of everyday life such as illness and the loss of a loved one.. I don't have much to say, except that I think it's one of the best games ever. sure, seen nowadays it may seem that it hasn't aged very well on the gameplay side but, on the other hand, when you judge a work from over twenty years ago you can't pretend it came out yesterday and judge it as you would a modern game . whoever does it is probably more interested in lowering the average than anything else.. Silent Hill 2 gets everything right about Horror. It knows exactly what to keep ambiguous and play up to the player’s imagination. It is so deep that almost every last little detail, from a wall's wallpaper, to a whisper that's just barely audible, and a radio's seemingly random burst of static, all has a profound and revealing reason to be there. one of the best horror ever made, if not the best. everything from the soundtrack, to the plot, to the gameplay helps to tell a story that has remained in the memory of those who have played it. A beautiful cursed love story. Fantastic game,fantastic story. I hope that the remake lives up to this incredible masterpiece of gaming history.. Prof_wild_young:think how stupid you have to be to believe that anyone who thinks this game is good has been brainwashed. unlike you, who instead have only one problem: non capisci na sega. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the best game I've ever played. The story and the characters stick to your head for real.. I get that its the first game to do true psychological horror, so I'll give it credit for that. But it has to lose points for the twilight zone dialogue, mediocre level design and horrific controls. Even the story, I have to say, was rather predictable. The enemy design and how it ties into your guilt is definitely a really good concept, and revolutionary for the genre.. The good: legendary story, legendary character, legendary music and sound design, legendary monster design, legendary overall The bad: some puzzle is completely doesn't make any sense because how little clue it given, but only some though.. The already iconic fog used in this game, intended to hide the rendering distance, is the best move the developers have made. Thanks to this trick, the atmosphere we find while playing turns everything 180 degrees. I think Silent Hill 2 is an example of the best horror game, because we don't encounter short pulse jumps in the form of jumpscares, but a long growing tension / fear of the unknown, hidden beyond our sight. What proves that Silent Hill 2 is one of the best items in its genre? That 20 years later, it's still being talked about.. Jumping down holes all willy nilly has never been better. 10/10 overall. Amazing.. One of the best horror games ever with an exquisite soundtrack, pure atmosphere and no cheap screamers.. Disappointment. Original Silent Hill is arguably better and much scarier. I never felt really nor interested not scared. Boring.. The best horror game of all time, hard to explain with words. This is when a game became art. Perfect..................................................................... Just finished the game and loved it the last part of it made me cry. It was so amazing the story the music, I hate the puzzle, but I enjoyed all the other parts. palace of the game where I got stuck in so I had to use a walkthrough mostly because I get stuck because of the puzzles. But when you get hit by that sed characters and the voice acting that is still amazing that is old comes together in a way where I can only sit with my jaw on the floor. I loved it. This is amazing this game make me feel things. I'm not used to by a video games. I have bought this game 5 times and sold it 4 this is my 5 attend to completed and I finally did it and I finally understand I finally understand what people's se in this game. Last month the game had a User score 9.1. Now it has 8.6? Why change the Score of a 21 year old game?. Best psychological survival horror i've ever played. Terrific in every part.. A masterpiece, I love the atmosphere that it manages to create together with the soundtrack and the artistic direction, the story is excellent, although at first the plot is not very convincing, it ends up taking shape as the story unfolds. And as for terror, it manages to be scary even in empty corridors where there is absolutely nothing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. It's one of those games that has aged very well. It is a quality work. They used sound and music in a highly artistic way. in my restless dreams i see that town silent hill. Silent Hill 2 is not for the faint hearted. The oppressive and often surreal atmosphere created by the beautiful story, absolutely consistent graphics and excellent sound is best suited for gamers who are looking for a game that can blur the lines between virtual reality and fiction.. This games story is remarkable. A deep and amazingly well constructed story. Great environments and puzzles. However, the enemy design is lacking which ruins some of the game for me. The controls are also a major flaw.. unbelievable. i cant recommend this enough. this has become my favourite game ever. I like silent hill game series. Best silent hill game. I don't forget this game.. No doubt this is a remarkable experience; although I don't find it to be as scary as people say it is, it's still very haunting, depressive and has an insanely well-built atmosphere surrounding its rather interesting characters; Eddie, Maria, Angela, and of course, our main guy, James. Speaking of James, this story is mostly about him, as he meet other people, and searches for his late wife, who's been dead for three years, yet somehow sent him a letter in her handwriting, asking if he could come visit her on their favorite spot, located in Silent Hill. This game is honestly, a slow-paced walk into the abyss, as places become more twisted and people sink into their own guilt. Just like Silent Hill explored Alessa's terrible past and tried to represent her feelings through monsters and environment, Silent Hill 2 dives into James' anguish, and sins. Almost everything is somehow connected to James' past, and how he feels about things he did. Gameplay-wise, I honestly liked it, except for the extremely messy camera angles and controls; but overall, the exploration and item search of Silent Hill always satisfied me enough to keep me from lashing out on other very annoying points of its gameplay. As we're getting a little more into technical aspects, I'd like to congratulate this game's graphics; it's still so beautiful to look at, somehow to this day, and there were basically no bugs or glitches. It plays very well. And all of this, of course, is backed by master artist Akira Yamaoka, and his incredibly amazing series of original soundtracks; this has got to be one of the most amazing things about this franchise. Silent Hill 2 proudly waves its horror banner, and has the power to scare without jump-scaring, which is honestly, a hard feat to accomplish. Its story will try its best to haunt you. Between the two, I prefer the first one, but the second entry deserves its recognition for its incredibly mature story and rather bold take on some themes. It probably stands side by side with the greatest horror experiences. A VERY GOOD game. The special edition comes with ""Born From a Wish"", which focuses on Maria just a little before she meets up with James. She explores a really creepy haunted house, as she tries to help a Silent Hill resident, whose family was taken from him. I liked this extra content, but it honestly left me with more questions than answers, on both the main plot and it's own little plot. It was good while it lasted, though; around two hours max.. SH2 is one of the few games that I completely underestimated on the first try. In fact, I had to read through fan reviews to realize what this game was all about. The awkward controls and the seemingly endless back-and-forth tarnish the enjoyment of the game in my opinion, but it's still mind-blowing.. In my restless dreams, I see that town. Silent Hill. You promised me you'd take me there again someday. But you never did.. Problaby the best survivor horror that i've ever played, the story, the lore and the enemies are perfects. The puzzles, as a Silent Hill game, are hard and pretty good. And i have no words for the Pyramid Head, one of the coolest bosses ever.. The best part of this excellent game was its soundtrack. And certainly I could say that the soundtrack is enough for upgrading the gaming experience by far.. What a amazingly horrifying and straight creepy game! The final act is bone chilling and hugely satisfying with a equally sad and hopeful ending. A story this good was complemented perfectly adding its ambient music collection.. It's **** incredible,if you have never played it before you need to,very nice story and,game plays fun too.. Perfection. Perfection. Perfection. Perfection. Perfection. Perfection. Perfection.. The silent hill series has truly beautiful yet disturbing games while some other ones in the saga needed more work put in, however this one (silent hill 2 ) stood out as the most hauntingly beautiful story and well made survival horror game the world has seen. Upon playing you'll immediately feel compelled to the story and want to find out what' this game is about. Along the way you'll come across deformed monsters, disturbing environments and bones chilling music and sounds made by stellar music artist akira yamaoka.There's also engaging and weird puzzles with some interesting yet bizarre characters you'll meet along the way . This is a deep and complex game that dives into the maddening world of emotionaly broken humans minds and will make you feel for these characters. It's hard to put into words what I experienced with this masterpiece. This isn't the first time that I've played Silent Hill 2, but it's the first time that I actually finished it. I'm glad I did. Ain't no point in delaying my verdict: this is one of the best games I've ever played! Silent Hill 2 isn't just a good survival horror, it's a deep psychological dive into the minds of disturbed characters, a masterclass in subjective imagery, a horrifying story to uncover and a stunning work of sound and music. One thing that needs to be absolutely praised here is how this game uses sounds, noises, music and ambient songs to scare and soothe the experience. Not only every single noise, and even silent moments, is masterfully used in the right moment to put you in the mood that it wants you to feel, but it also packs a modest, immersive and beautiful soundtrack. Thank you, Akira Yamaoka. But sound design isn't Silent Hill 2's only key feature. The writing is interesting, level design is near flawless, pacing keeps you tense, the eerie voice acting fits the atmosphere, the dark graphics are nerve-racking and even the puzzles stand out. Not to mention the story. In its own unique and subjective way of capturing your attention and desire to keep going, James Sunderland's melodic and frightening tale manages to tell one of gaming's deepest stories. It even manages to pay off with its 6 different endings. The only bad aspect about Silent Hill 2 is that the gameplay is outdated. There's no running away from it. It may still hold up better than most survival horror games out there, but it's undeniably stiff and clunky. The camera ****, tank controls are harsh, movement is too rigid, animations may feel a bit off during cutscenes and MY GOD the combat is bad. I know that the game's clunkiness adds up to its horror-factor, but the combat is just not fun. The good thing though, maybe compesating to SH2's outdated mechanics, is that the experience is VERY scary. It messes with your eyes, ears, reflexes and perceptions. Even here, in 2021, this game is still one of the scariest and most intense games ever made, in my opinion. It not only does right by the genre, but by video game design as art. If you somehow get your hands in this game, whether it's on a PS2, PC or even on the inferior HD remaster, you're in for a memorable experience. One for a lifetime. Especially if you're a survival horror fan. Trust me. Take a trip to Silent Hill. You won't regret it.. One of the best games ever PS2 era, graphics also served as an amazing example of how well a game can be pushed on PS2. This game had smart developers, especially with the dog ideas so that you got more play time than loading time. Perfect idea, perfect game. Scary,. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. absolutely perfect story line. game atmosphere is freaking scary with an iconic soundtrack.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is absolutely perfect in every single thing. The music made by Akira Yamaoka is perfect during the entire experience and it helps to make a very good atmosphere for the game. The story is very good, i didn't expect that plot-twist at the very end, i just don't have enough words to describe how many emotions this game make me feel, it's just the bes horror game i have ever played.. MASTERPIECE! story is phenomenal, soundtrack is breathtaking, even the graphic holds up pretty good till this day. If you haven't experienced it yet just get it and immerse yourself in it.. It is a really good game with a fascinating story but I did not see the „Best videogame of all time“ or „Deepest story of all time” many associate with the game. To clarify: I do not say that it is a bad game (not even close) or the story is garbage (it is really good). I say it is not the best ever and it uses the old trick to tell the story in a more indirect way for you to fill the gaps. For many this created the feeling of depth in a story (Like the TV show Lost or Neo Genesis Evangelion for example where you see at the ending that they had no road-map for the story / conclusion). However the story is still really good with some layers that added depth. Back to the review. The prequel was a remarkable game that impressed many gamers and critics alike. This put the bars higher for any sequel. Luckily it delivers and it is also a classic of survival horror genre. In contrast to the Resident Evil games it is focused more on psychological horror and deep atmosphere. It succeeds as it has the same haunting atmosphere as the prequel and feeling of dread while the gameplay is also really good. The story starts when protagonist James Sunder","the story is great, kinda tedious to play though, alot of clunky controls throughout, which im not a fan of . right from the jump you have to do everything in a linear order or important objects don't appear for you . this game is dumb. Graphics are bad, controls are bad, and enemies aren't scary ."
488.Castlevania Dominus Collection,"10-10 must play collection, there is not a single bad game in this collection. Castlevania Dominus Collection is a well-crafted compilation of three standout Metroidvania titles: Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin, and Order of Ecclesia. Each game brings something unique to the table, from the soul system in Dawn of Sorrow to the dual-protagonist mechanic in Portrait of Ruin and the challenging world map in Order of Ecclesia. The collection features high-quality emulation, enhancements like save states and rewind features, and historical bonuses, including the remastered Haunted Castle. This package is a treat for Castlevania fans, offering both nostalgia and modern accessibility. I finished all 3 games and haunted castle og and revisited. If you love metroidvania games then go for it! 3 games for 25€ is gifted imo. The gave every game a rewind Option for New player which is good for gamers with less time for gaming!. Ultra rare Konami W here. It took the three titles from the DS Era, Order of Ecclesia, Portrait of Ruin, and Dawn of Sorrow, and added a rewind feature to make it easier for new players to experience. Order of Ecclesia is one of my all time favourite games alone. Another good feature is the inclusion of Haunted Castle, with updated graphics. Plus, the UI is very helpful, using the DS second screen effectively. And at a great price, the Dominus Collection is a must buy for both Castlevania diehards, and potential newcomers. Just get used to difficulty if you fall into the latter.","Castlevania Dominus Collection is a well-crafted compilation of three standout Metroidvania titles . each game brings something unique to the table, from the soul system in Dawn of Sorrow to the dual-protagonist mechanic in Portrait of Ruin . the collection features high-quality emulation, enhancements like save states and rewind features ."
489.Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Between all the ""mgs3 type of gameplay"" games in this franchice, this was the one that clicked for me the variety of things you can do is really fun like the cqc, holdups, walkman, magazines, etc. The gameplay is just so addicting; the main ops, building your motherbase, and the score system. The missions that require you to play the game in a certain way make it so fresh that the not so remarkable story doesnt matter. If you take your time not just to rush the story, but to dig deep in this game, you will find not just the best game on the psp, but one of the best games ever made.. Metal Gear Solid isn’t anti war, it’s pro peace. When a PSP game makes you cry.. It's a good game, definitely don't is the best of the series, but is a good game for PSP. Maybe it is because I played it in 2024 in a simulator. Bur I found it kind of boring.. The beginning of the end, thematically and metaphorically, MGS on Playstation's portable platform represents the first cracks in Big Boss' philosophy— the MSF, and the Metal Gear Series as a whole. Stellar voice acting and narrative moments aside, a shoddy control scheme and the mind-numbing structure of its final (hardly optional) chapter shows that 'Peace Walker' is only in parts brilliant. Without ever really living up to the potential of a numbered entry by the engulfment of illogical game-pace decisions, Kojima produces an enjoyable experience that is, in nature, too much ''Monster Hunter'' and too little ''Metal Gear.''. You need check game out one the best game and lot action game and good music and story best and good day. Great game, Although being a spin-off it would totally deserves its place in the main line.. One of my favorite PSP games and definitely one of the best M.G.S games I played. The story is great the only downfall is the graphics as i played it on the P.S Vita on a Oled screen, so it look outdated. If they remake it with the current engine i might replayed it again .. This is the beginning of the end for me. Some weird **** in this game. Weirder than usual.. a good concept with clear design , metal gear peace walker starts well , tank battle is way to hard for a psp game that would a lot skill to complete , good render and visuals , and good design overall , not the best Metal gear solid by far less humour , less weapons , and poor layout of weapons , its a game with many mistakes with success of metal gear brand , weapon layout , tank battles with 1 human and 1 tank is unrealistic , where limited weapons ,. The best PSP game of all time, it’s a peace of art, a full main link to the series, story got told by a unique art style cinamatics and great linear gameplay + challenging bossfights, the soundtrack and characters, the cassettes and all the moments in this game including the ending gives it the title I mentioned. This game has so much value and it's one that should never be skipped even if it was originally released on PSP.. Best portable Metal Gear Solid game of all time! It still holds up well and is incredibly fun to play!. so much fun, a more linear MGS V, though not as sandbox-y. I wish you could aim like in MGS 2 and 3 though.. Truly amazing game with so much content and a great story. The only thing that's holding it back is the system. Due to the limitations, the graphics have been downgraded (although not too noticeable) and the resolution is a bit low. The cutscenes are also presented in a comic book style fashion, but they are still entertaining to watch and easy to understand. The controls have definitely been improved compared to the last 3 games, but the lack of a second analogue definitely weakens it a bit. Other than that, the gameplay is fun, the story is great, and the final boss fight is epic. And once you're finished with the main missions, there are still a lot of unique and fun side missions you can do. Definitely not perfect, but the pros severely outnumber the cons. In my opinion, the HD version on PS3, Xbox 360 and Xbox One are the best way to play it, so if you own any of those consoles, I suggest you get the HD edition rather than the PSP edition, due to it fixing some of the problems I listed. If you only have a PSP, it is a definite must buy for the console.. The best and most complete game made for the PSP. It pushes every boundary of the handheld system. Amazing story, amazing graphics, amazing gameplay.. The best psp games ever made, and one of the best metal gear games of all time.. A great game but not as good as his predecesors in almost every aspect. Still. Recommended for the fans.. A unique masterpiece that can be easily the best PSP game ever created. Amazing story, great graphics, fantastic gameplay, etc etc. MGS Peace Walker has everything we can ask to a Metal Gear game. One of the best in the series and as I said before, by far the best PSP game, even better than GOW Chains of Olympus or Ghost of Sparta (and that says everything).. Best game on PSP. Characters, story, boss fights, everything is great. One of the best games ever.. I love how the story is told through illustrations and the plot is actually insteresting and captivating.. Are you blind people? this games only 8.7 ? 9.0 this is real score for this masterpiece ,much more better story than boring Death Stranding HALO PEOPLE WAKE up and high score this brilliant game.. While the control took some time to get used to, the story telling and visual presentation were the best of that era. The missions which come in chunks don't immerse the player enough in the game. Compared to the home console titles in the series, Peace Walker feels like a downgrade. The laborious post game also should have been cut down to give a present a tighter game.. Negative: -Characters are really boring -Kojima didnt put a lot of stealth missions, is this game GEARS OF WAR?? -Controls -Bullet Sponge boss fight Positive: -Ending of this story -Combat -Gears Of War mechanics -Stealth mechanics -Frame Rates are really great -Graphics For me Peace Walker was a really good experience and I know there is a lot of mistakes about this game but PSP is limited technology 82/100. As someone who is not a big fan of MGS 1,2,3 or 4 I was very surprised that I loved Peace Walker. The controls and tight and you are never fighting for view of the enemy or having to crawl everywhere on your nuts, because you can crouch walk in this game, AMAZING. The story is also well told and has far less pretentious rambling, it stick to the important details and is told in very stylish animated slideshow. Peace walk and MGS 5 are so different from all the other MGS games I have a hard time believing that Kojima had much to do with these games.. It is a great nostalgic journey through MGS folklore. By far the best game on the psp. A 9/10 taking into consideration the limitations of the psp. Its intelligent design using limited resources. A real old school approach. And if youre not dancing along to the music during THAT fight then you have no soul.. Best PSP game. Was in Japan when this came out and it made the long train rides fun. Sunk Probably 200 hours into the game. I have 100 percent beat MGS 1, 4, 5 and this game. Got the Big Boss medal in 4 before they patched it, had to reset ps3 1000 times. Anyways. I give the game a 10 because it is in the top 1 percent of PSP games. Soo addicting.. The greatest Metal Gear Solid Hideo Kojima has created and the best Video Game you can buy for the Sony PSP. MGS: Peacewalker is simply the best portable game I have ever played. Exciting story, excellent controls, deep base management, and tons of bonuses and extras to keep you playing, even after the credits roll. Almost every mission can be played co-op as well. The missions are actually quite carried, having you perform a large variety of tasks keeps it interesting. The cut scenes are somewhat interactive, and more so than simple QTE sequences; occasionally for hilarious results.. As an intro MGS:PW sets a few years after MGS:PO , Big boss disappears and sets to make an army with the aid of KAZ. The presentation of the game is outstanding, the comic cutscene are nicely done and the story makes sense even if you aren't a follower of the Metal gear series. Graphics here are solid, it is very well done, the effects such as the rain and night in certain mission adds. Brilliant game. It doesn't compare to other Metal Gear Solid games like MGS3 or MGS but still, really really good. At first, the story is boring but the more you play it, the more interesting it gets. However, I disliked the fact that boss battles were only machines or ""metal gear"" bosses instead of human bosses. Still, great game, definitely in my top 10 of best games of all time.. Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is another great game in this amazing series. This game continues the story of Big Boss and I liked that. The story is great as well as the writing. Overall it's what you'd expect from the series, except it's also not. The controls could've been way better and I wasn't a big fan of the comic-book type style of the cut scenes. It just didn't fit. In the end, this is a great game.. For a PSP game this is one of the best however when it comes to overall MGS franchise this game falls withing the lower end of my favorite MGS games. The game mechanics are new and sets up for what you can expect in MGS V.. Game with a lot of content and a lot of variety accompanied by a great story and essential to follow the saga metal gear.. Wow! What a masterpiece! This game alone is worth buying a PSP. I haven't had this much fun or spent this much time playing a Metal Gear since the original for the PS1.. A good game. The presentation is ok and I like the drawn cutscenes. The voice-acting is good and the story is enjoyable. The gameplay was great and I adored mother base. I liked how replayable it is because of the missions. The soundtrack is probably one of the best in MGS. Now, my problems is that nothing is explained, you can't change weapons during missions, the bosses are uninspired and it's **** that you have to do busy work to unlock the final chapter. Well, I didn't play so much psp games, but I've managed to look through all the AAA games and I can say with all the surety - It's the biggest PSP game. The most advanced and absolutely full of content! If you want to beat all the side missions you'll have to spent more than 30-40 hours of your life! And I'm speaking only about the single missions content! I am a big fan of the series and my favourite from back in the days till now on is the Metal Gear Solid! I've beated the Snake Eater just recently and I can say with no hesitation - although MGS3 for PS2 is the chicken considering the plot and mechanics, but MSS Peace Walker (being the egg) is far more beautiful, deep, fun and various! I also like it's graphics and storytelling! Not to mention all those side quests and whole chapter, that is only available only if you are a true fan and geek) I played this game on the PC via emulator, and I'll tell you that even in 2017 it still does the trick!. The game seems to me like a prototype Metal Gear Solid 5 the Phantom Pain. It plays like it and since I played MGSV as my first Metal Gear game it was welcome. The base building and combat teams were similar .The story was great and made me understand the plot of Ground Zeroes. My only peeves with the game are the crappy controls. I found the mission before the second peace walker battle a nightmare that gave me cramps and tight muscles from the left trigger being so vertical unlike an Xbox controller where they are out. The game also assumes you happen to have a pal with a PSP and this game with four player coop on boss battles and 2 on some stealth making the bosses a difficult grind and often taking me hours of time and trying to find someone at my school with a PSP and this game which is like finding a hint of politeness in the presidential debates. Other than the controls the game has beautiful stealth with pretty great AI of the soldiers. Pick this game up if you have a PSP and love metal gear and have a pal to play with you through the game.. I thought this was a brilliant game as it gives players a chance to experience the tactical espionage that comes from all metal gear games by playing through the story and watching as Snake accepts his heritage as Big Boss and the birth of Outer Heaven.. The PSP is ready to explode with the quality of this game... In a good way. The weapon ammount is massive, you can recruit Kojima, paint ZEKE pink and go on dates. Simply put, the best MGS game since the PSX.. Metal Gear is known as one of the many critical acclaimed franchises in the game industry all thanks to Hideo Kojima and the ""support"" of Konami. Though my first game was Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty back on the PlayStation 2 during its release, I only decided to return to the franchise with Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker back in 2010. I'll be giving this game a score based on my opinion and not what others think of it; I know there are many people who gave this game a certain review such as the following: love it with no explanation why, hate it with no explanation why, love it and judge gamers who never understood the plot of the franchise and finally hate it and judge gamers who have understood the plot. My review will be honest as it can be. The plot takes place ten years in 1974 after the events of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Naked Snake, or Big Boss, now runs his own small private army named MSF 'Militaires Sans Frontières' (Soldiers Without Borders) alongside Kazuhira Miller. They are given a small off-shore plant Mother Base which players can expand the more they play, more on that later; the base is given to them by a professor/CIA chief Ramón Gálvez Mena who plea for Big Boss to force an army out of Costa Rica as they are suspicious to carry weapons and nukes in what was once a peaceful country. I won't spoil the further of the story here but it gets better as you go along; flashbacks to MGS3 are shown constantly throughout the story so newcomers aren't left out of the plot. The game play is pretty basic and easy to use on the PSP; the analog stick to move, X to crouch and crawl, the left D-pad to bring up the items window while right is used to bring up the weapons window with Square and Circle to navigate, Triangle or D-pad up to attach against a wall or to reload. The left trigger is used to aim down the sights with the X, Square, Circle and Triangle buttons being used to control the camera and right trigger to fire. when not aiming, right trigger is used to hold up enemies or to use CQC (Close Quarters Combat). The graphics are gorgeous on PSP, many consider the graphics as a weak point with PSP games but sometimes forget that the PSP isn't capable of enhanced graphics. The game is mainly stealth but the option for run and gun is there if the player is that kind; the main feature of the game is Mother Base itself, you manage the departments by placing soldiers into the departments they have a special skill towards ( S rank R&D soldier, B rank Intel team soldier, etc.) and through this you can expand Mother Base's size and capacity. Mother Base allows you to put your soldiers at work and have them produce weapons, food, intel, GMP (the game's currency) as well as deploying the soldiers into battle. You need to keep the GMP count high and own a lot of food by putting skilled members into the Mess Hall department otherwise soldiers will leave due to low morale and food or will fall ill and will be transported to the Sick Bay, sometimes they will die and you will lose some good soldiers due to this. You can play all missions alone but it is better when you play with another player; story missions and extra missions are up to two players while all boss battles are four players. The game will keep record of your results on all missions, single and multi, you can achieve four different ranks depending on how well you play: S, A, B and C. On the Mother Base screen, you can play multiplayer which is up to six players total; this version of multiplayer is similar to Metal Gear Online from MGS3 with all the game modes such as Team Deathmatch, Capture the Base, etc. with the maps being from the main campaign as well as some exclusives. Peace Walker's multiplayer is time consuming fun and is better than that of a Call of Duty game where skill actually counts and not everything is run and gun. I highly recommend this game to anyone, Metal Gear fan or not, you always get some enjoyment out of it whether it's sneaking past enemies in a cardboard box or using heavy weapons like a minigun or a sniper rifle to make potshots out of enemies from a distance. The ten in the score is really my given opinion, even if many users gave it the same and not explain much more why they give it the usual 10/10; some that give it a 0/10 would've never played a Metal Gear game before or don't know how to do a game review while some give it something like a 2/10 and explain deeply why and I accept that.. I find it to be a great game, an easy to understand gameplay (even having 3 different set-ups), a great story that you can understand even without playing or knowing much of the other games, and great quantity of content. And all of that ONLY on the single player, having double the fun on multiplayer. The only thing i find it lacking, was that the guards and enemies were nothing special. You could go gun blazing naked with the lowest powered pistol and still be able to pass the whole game (except bosses). Now, the bosses, they were great battles. Each with a different feeling to it and each has at 3 different versions, the last ones being hair tearing. Also, Monster hunter. OVERALL:10 Peace Walker is my favorite Metal Gear game, The Phantom Pain included. I could not stop playing it. PRESENTATION:10 It has the best music of the series, one of the best stories (presented in excellent monochrome motion comics, which I prefer to CGI), and David Hayter's (the actual Big Boss) voice. Unlike TPP, audio cassettes are organized by mission, and aren’t where PW puts its most critical plot points. My favorite line, though, (“Revolution or no revolution, you pick up a gun, and sooner or later you're going to hell. Are you prepared for that?”) isn’t in a cutscene. Kojima had intended PW to be MGS5 before relegating it to a device few own. Whereas TPP was a disorganized side-story adding little to the cannon, PW is integral and delivered linearly. It presents Snake heroically, but he crosses the moral thresholds (i.e. forcible drafting, child soldiers, ironically endorsing nuclear deterrence) that set up Metal Gear 1. Kojima's games (ZOE:2nd Runner) always push the limits of Playstation systems, and PW looks gorgeous for a PSP game. Individual leaves on a snipers’ ghillie suits hid them in the foliage and added to gameplay. The interface both in the field (damage readouts per hit) and in menus are works of art. CONTROL:6 PW is a third person shooter with stealth options and close-range grab/throwing. Controls are always awkward in MGS games, and the fewer buttons of a PSP isn't helping. I like half-pushing the joystick to walk silently. But with only one analog nub, PW resorts to “tank” controls (left and right turn instead of strafe) so I ran in alot of accidental circles. Aiming is stilted by relying on the D-pad (or buttons). Autoaim (the ""off"" option just means ""less"") helps, but I never like autoaim. There’s not enough buttons to go around comfortably, but try “shooter” control in the menu to at least move and shoot simultaneously. Supposedly the PS4 version in the Metal Gear HD Collection solves these problems with dual analog controls, so I recommend that. If the HD collection didn't exist, PW would justify buying a PSP. Movement while prone or against a wall is absent, but was never useful in past games. The dodgeroll cancels the reload animation and is great when missiles start raining. Inexcusably, the game doesn’t pause while switching weapons/items (which controls awkwardly), limiting your ability to react in time. Some of the motion comics have QTE's, a horrible idea (especially the impossible torture bit). But there are 2 comic sequences with gameplay (albeit simple)--aiming at the kidnapper and horse-galloping between missiles; more of those would have been nice. Stealth improves as you unlock items. My favorite trick is tossing a smoke grenade, running in with nightvision goggles, and chain-throwing a whole group. The E3 2013 trailer for MGS:TPP intermittently sped up, and I wish there was a 3x-normal ""speed-up button"" in PW (not just 12-hr-blocks like the TPP Phantom Cigar) while sneaking, to relieve the annoyance of waiting for guards to turn around and walk away. The key selling point is the boss battles. The mechanical behemoths have various patterns and multiple targets, so combat involves prioritizing either weak points or specific parts to stop different attack patterns. Cocoon is almost a ""Shadow of the Colossus"" with guns. Missions where a tank/helicopter is protected by soldiers best integrate all the gameplay elements. DESIGN:10 TPP lifted its best elements from PW, primarily Fulton extraction, which ties the upgrade system to motivation to play stealthily. ""Auto-assign"" and signposting which upgrades are ready streamline what would otherwise be a chore. PW isn't open-world, but I like that: missions are short enough to play in bursts. Multiplayer is amazing, the one time I could find someone to try it with. There's nothing like taking on a boss or sneaking through a level co-op. Others have complained of onerous requirements to beat PW (Chapter 5), but it's just that many things are hidden (Google the Straw Box, Monster Hunter levels, and the last Zadornov). I never felt like I had to ""farm"" levels since I didn’t care about trying out every gun. Some of its coolest items are locked until the late game, when the necessary missions are available. What’s the point of new ways to extract after your base is maxed out? Or of newer guns after you’ve beaten every boss? You do unlock enough, at a steady enough stream, to get everything you really need just from the main missions. And there's little motivation to switch out the M16 and LAW. I appreciate that PW lets you take the lower-level versions into battle to preserve challenge on easy missions. Similarly, you shouldn’t skip to the hardest Extra Ops until you have the better guns. PW is enormous, 20 hrs+ even without unlocking everything, and it never got boring. Even if you didn’t like previous Metal Gears or already saw the cutscenes on Youtube, get PW for the boss battles alone. But get the HD Collection on PS3.. this is a psp masterpiece stealth game,awesome graphics for the psp,awesome gameplay system,awesome controls and a major story,i don't see any bugs playing it,i recommend to everyone that likes stealth games.. There's so many things to do in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. It's story isn't the best in the series, and the bosses are really annoying to fight alone, but because it's a great continuation of MGS3 with intelligent game design that's comparable to Monster Hunter AND with a wealth amount of content, it's a game I'm still playing.. Great game. Just **** game itself looks really good and is one of the best games for the **** missions are nice and playing with others is very nice. Took me a while to remember the controls tho.. One of my favourite games out there. It's missions and motherbase system while its new to the franchise, is the strongest point of this game. The story as always is stunning and immersive but kind of short. However, we have a ton of extra ops to complete and trust me, you will need to spend a lot of time to complete them or to developed all types of weapons and objects in the R&D team. My save file has over 120 hours of playtime I haven't finished it yet!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The controls for MGS are not good on PSP. The setting is in a lot of open forest area which isn't good for sneaking, the AI realism, or the size of the PSP screen, and the darker color scheme. The levels are like MGS:3 which were not tight. This removed a lot of the pre-programmed camera angles forcing you to move the camera yourself. Camera control is a contant hindrance in the game. You can be right in front of guys and they barely see you. You can walk out in front of someone and not know whats going on because of the camera. I'm going to be honest, I can barely aim my gun. The story doesn't start out strong and cut scenes are like an animated graphic novel. Here we have another MGS set in a time that doesn't have a lot of advanced technology, which was half the point of MGS1 and 2. This game also has an annoying menu system. You can't just play through, but you need to equip several things and switch characters and gear ahead of time. So far, MGS: Acid2 has been my favorite PSP game. I don't think MGS was meant to be on the PSP like the console games. This is a non-essential game.. I don't play PSvita or PSP, because in this platform you can put some greats storylines on the games (and i love the story on games). this was the reason that i am a Metal Gear fan. I don't put a 10 on all the metal Gear games bacause i am a fan, i am a fan because i considered the games deserved a 10. And i guess this deserves a 10 too. I mean if you compared this to a overall PS2 or PS3 game, maybe it deserve a 7 or 8. But this was for PSP. I can really imagine another great game on the PSP console. Kojima adapted the gameplay and the scenarios of metal Gear for this platform, and this was bigger on graphics than portable Ops. The bosses fights was really good, even than the bosses are only machines was really goods. At the beggining i wasn't to interested on the Mother Base thing, but even that it's so catchy i send my army to fight and was cool fight with tanks and helicopters for your army can use on the war. The thing that i most like, (like all the Metal Gear saga it's the history). How Kojima can create such a great storyline and put it in the PSP was incredible, the only way to do it was on the comic thing. I love the fact than the story is on LatinAmerica, the return of the Cold War thing, the importance of master Miller and for Huey. The end of The Boss storyline. The cassetes tapes too. And the final battle with Peace Walker, i didn't have development the Supply box from Miller, and was out of ammo 2 times after playing something like 30 minutes, and then when i kill Peace Walker i didn't press the triangule button....Really good experience playing this game. never expect to have so much funny with a PSP game and for that i give this a 10!. This game is EPIC.. I literaly ended my psp life with this game. First of all its huge!!! The things they have puted inside is mindblowing... The graphics are perfect for psp... i dont think that any game could do beter with that device and with that gameplay. You can do almost anything... buld a base, recruit soldiers, steal helicopters, tanks, literaly every venicle you encounter. YOU CAN BUILD YOUR OWN METAL GEAR!! You can upgrade your metal gear with cards from boss batles. Replayability to 200 hr. And its freaking hilarious... inside jokes. funny dialogues. I wish to remaster it for a pc with fox engine someday.. The game is filled with content, gameplay has been improved compared to previous titles, the story is great and easy to follow ( somehow ) the base building system has kept me going and I'm well over 100 hours into this game and I bought it for my Xbox and psp like two weeks ago. This is outer heaven. This game is one that everyone who buys it will either keep or rage to. The controls are pretty easy ( X to fire, analog stick to move, etc...) and killing enemies are pretty easy.... unless they are alerted of your presence and every bad guy comes to kill you. The story is easy to follow, and the graphics are awesome! The cut scenes are done in a graphic novel, which is awesome, but are sometimes boring to watch. A lot of times, you have to fight huge bosses (mostly machines) and losing to them will make you restart the level. This game also lets you knock out bad guys and recruit them by using a Fulton system. Overall, This game is one of my favorite PSP games. If you like stealth games that you can play for a long time, give this game a try and see if it fits your criteria.. One of the best titles on PSP. Looks good, gameplay is good. Every boss is hard, but not impossible to defeat. makes game challenging, but not frustrating. The enviorment falls apart in places ,so you cant hide from a tank eventually the wall your behind is destroyed. Enemy AI are pretty good espeacially for PSP. This title could be good on any system.. Two things: First of all, this game... is amazing. Why? Because you can do many things... you can even put on some camo, upgrade weapons, recruit soldiers and many other things. Second of all: To all those fans and other people who dislike this game... even if you can't crawl or even if the controls are messed up, you can still play and enjoy it. It takes some practice and skill... you have to be smart, but think about it before rushing... it's a tactical espionage game for God's sake... but one thing is for sure... the story is amazing, the system and graphics (for PSP) are simply the best and the side-mission are a-lot and fun. People should focus on it and play for some time, get to know the controls and you're OK! Hideo Kojima simply creates the best games... every MGS that he and his team made so far are just simply amazing. Nothing is impossible in this game, you can hide to evade the enemy alert, you can knock them out before they realise it... and so many other things. Simply amazing!. This comes from a MGS fan. This game is not MGS at all. It smells very Japanese, RPG elements that tries to make you grind, silly co-op, silly boss battles similar to Monster Hunter (fighting mechanic monsters) and most of the time, stupid cutscenes. Cutscenes are stupid not because of the cartoonish style but the way characters are written and voiced over (in English). If you are looking for more MGS, avoid this game and instead see a Youtube all story video.. Pretty good. Although it took me until the Xbox 360 and PS3 version to make me decide ""this game is massive and brilliant!"" It was mainly because of controls. Regardless, this is a great game despite some big flaws.. Amazing game for PSP. Especially game play is really comfortable than the other games. You can easily get used to it. Also, it has a great storyline. It's very gripping like the other games in the series. If you are a hardcore PSP fan, you should try this game. I can easily say that it's much better than Portable Ops.. As an intro MGS:PW sets a few years after MGS:PO , Big boss disappears and sets to make an army with the aid of KAZ. The presentation of the game is outstanding, the comic cutscene are nicely done and the story makes sense even if you aren't a follower of the Metal gear series. Graphics here are solid, it is very well done, the effects such as the rain and night in certain mission adds some taste for it. Sounds, music and voice acting are very well done too, you can also equip a radio and listen to music As for gameplay missions are divided into 2 missions, Main missions which follows the story of the game and side missions to help improve soldiers, make new weapons and items as well as unlocking further content. MGS also returns camouflage which has grown to be better and more real Another nice Add on is that you can now build your base assign soldiers, scientist, doctors and send soldiers to the battlefield. As your base grows it will expand and your army will become stronger to develop new weapons, items and even your very own metal gear The game also has m","the gameplay is just so addicting; the main ops, building your motherbase, and the score system . it's a good game, definitely don't is the best of the series, but is a good game for PSP . a shoddy control scheme and the mind-numbing structure of its final chapter shows that 'Peace Walker' is only in parts brilliant ."
49.Red Dead Redemption,"The second is definitely the stronger game & narrative - but that doesn't make this any less of an incredible experience. Considering its time, the quality and attention to detail is stunning, and is definitely a game worth playing.. Just a Masterpiece. Been waiting for 4 years to play this game, glad it got ported to new gen consoles.. I play this with a xbox 360 disc in a Xbox one S And the graphics are good and the story is amazing I’m waiting RDR2 to arrive but RDR1 story and characters are perfect and the gameplay is really fun. The best western of all **** beatiful design and atmosphere are doing their job.. never in my life has a game made me want to kill a horse more. never in my life have I screamed such profanities at a horse. 10/10. Exceptional story and great mechanics 14 years later I specifically took a liking to the character Nigel west **** he had a charming chubby atmosphere and a great story. After 14 years the game shows its age — both in terms of mechanics and, most importantly, at a technical level — but this is still a solid experience. Quest design gets a little repetitive and the storytelling has the occasional plot hole and ellipses, but the atmosphere is top notch. All the areas are designed so well… it’s still very much a beautiful game. If you keep the aim assist on, it’s also an enjoyable casual third person shooter. If you’ve never played and you’re into westerns, this is still very much worth playing.. I'll start this off by saying that I'm probably the wrong audience for this game as I don't really enjoy the GTA games either. Honestly, I find the Rockstar formula bland unless the story is excellent- which wasn't the case in this one. The story missions and characters are absurd, I get that Rockstar have a thing for satirizing and ridiculing the extreme of American society but I don't understand what was the point of it in this game. The ending did get me teary-eyed a bit but it does feel cheap and made to be a tear-jerker. Other than that the shooting itself is good alongside the general gameplay loop. However, while playing in hardcore it's extremely frustrating to sometimes be one shot and sometimes be able to take a couple of bullets form the same enemy which was really annoying.. Red Dead Redemption was Rockstars approach to a genre that was very much ignored by the gaming industry. They did a fantastic job capturing the loneliness and freedom of the wild west. But other than in their GTA series, the real star of the show is the story. John Marstons struggle to escape his past and find redemption to live a peaceful life with his family is timeless. The graphics on the Xbox 360 were state of the art and the dialogue and voice actors outstanding. An instant classic.. Please add AutoHDR and FPS Boost Feature on the Xbox Series X|S version .Thank you Rockstar games. an all right game honestly it **** cause Red dead redemption 2 is my favourite game this was just really mediocre and the Bonnie mission **** I only got invested when bill,Javier and Dutch was there but after you find you meet Dutch it gets really good. Red Dead Redemption captures the wild west near perfectly. It is a package worth its price of entry. One of the greatest games i have ever played, this game perfectly captures the dying west, and the beauty of it, this game is beautiful, whether you are in the snowy mountains in the very height of the map or in the very lower parts in the stunning mexico cities, this game never ceases to amaze me with its beauty and amazing story 200/10 Highly Recommend. A True masterpiece with a wonderful story. Even better when you play 2 and then 1 for the best experience. The story is great and the atmosphere IS IMO even better than in RDR2.. Overall, a very good game. After 14 years, you can feel the marks of time, mainly due to the slightly wooden controls and animations, but apart from that, the game is good. + Great atmosphere and immersion.+ Cool and refined characters+ Rockstar's dark humor + Good shooting feeling, although Aim Assist takes away most of the fun. + Very good storyline. - Wooden movement of the hero. - Binary Aim Assist (when zooming in on an enemy, it immediately lands on the enemy, when we move it to the side, there is no more assistance, so shooting looks like non-stop: 1. zoom in 2. shoot 3. zoom out. This takes away almost all the fun of shooting, because in reality, the only thing we do ourselves is pull the trigger). - Abridged presentation of the characters of Javier and Bill (who, after all, are one of the main characters of the story) - No Polish translation. - Only 30 FPS on Xbox Series XI rate the game 7.5/10. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Rockstar games always excel in their games they are incomparable with other games, Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece in all the ways the gameplay world graphics and certainly the story. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The original Red Dead Redemption is wicked fun. Its gameplay is tighter and sharper than its sequel. The music has no right to be as good as it is. And its protagonist, John Marston, is a badass and a compelling character in equal measure. This is one of the greatest games ever made.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Story: 10/10 Characters: 10/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Visuals: 9/10 Soundtrack: 9/10 One of the best games of all time.. I played this game when it first came out years ago. I hadn't expected it to have such a profound impact on me, but I felt like I was living out the Sergio Leone's movie ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" The desert scenes are so true to the old Southwest, and the music and cinematography were just gorgeous. I particularly appreciated that I could go and spend as much time as I wanted gambling within the game ... mainly to get better outfits so I could run with the gangs! To this day (15 years later), this remains one of my all-time favorites.. Red Dead Redemption is a great game. Rockstar Games definitely lives up to their name by… well, being rockstars. The story is rich as the player goes on a journey to get revenge while doing some dirty deeds in the process. Players have to make moral decisions that impact whether you’re seen as a lawful or awful person. Its open world concept makes this game near-unending. John Marston, as a main protagonist, is wonderfully written. The side characters… are either mediocre or stereotypically bad. After playing RDR2 (the better of the two games), it’s clear to see that this game could definitely have done better with character writing. Some other (small) gripes with this game: first, it gets a bit repetitive with main and side missions. For its time, it was groundbreaking as a “Wild West GTA”. But playing it years later, it comes off a tad stale as you need to constantly accompany people before you kill a that randomly shows up, or you need to save them from some inconvenience. And don’t get me started on the lines and LINES of dialogue during your accompaniment… good lord. I found myself searching for “Skip to Destination” prompt after the first act of the game. It gets unbearable listening to constant exposition when I’m trying to move the story along. Overall, this is a great game; but RDR2 is the clear winner - Granted, RDR2 had much more developments in programming and developing. I think Red Dead Redemption is a game that should be played for its story and leisure. It still holds up today very nicely.. Another masterpiece by Rockstar Games. It's very much like ""Grand Theft Auto IV"", but set in the Old West. The game pays tribute to Western movies, while staying true to the Rockstar formula. The action is great, the story is compelling and the presentation is amazing. It's easily one of the best action-adventure games on the PS3. Overall, I would rate this with a 9.5 out of 10.. This game was so ahead of its time and absolutely goated. the online mode was also very fun. I don't even need to say much here, this game itself is a Rockstar masterpiece, John Marston is one of the best protagonists in games (in my opinion) magnificent gameplay, magnificent STORY, really a Rockstar masterpiece. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Truely one of a kind. Truely a groundbreaking game for the time it released and truly and emotional spectacle. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Truly a phenomemal experience I will not forget. This is a masterpiece!!!!!. A good game where you can have fun with the open world, the story isn't the besy. Definitely the best game I've ever played after red dead redemption 2,the game at first maybe won't be very good but with more missions and more story the better it gets and it has a great world with great stranger missions and there's a lot of things to do in the game especially if you have undead nightmare which is one the best dlc ever. In general the history looks good but I have seen several Bugs in the game, even playing with different OS. It is really imposible to manage it. Uninstalled After playing few hours.. I like it, but this MF game has so much bugs, i was playing, this **** Just stopped let me walk. And much times i try tô get a gun but it dont let, why? A **** BUG.. One of the best games I’ve ever played and it’s not just the nostalgia speaking. Nice Gameplay,Story,Characters and the physics are on a whole another level!. Great game overall. i'd give more like 8.5not 9/10. Played on xbox series x only on 30fps and still loved the game. I really do hate 30 fps. If game does not have 60 fps mode it's not completed. Because it's old game i do not mind.. I love this game, one of the best games ever made in videogames history. Is an experience to ride with John Marston around the West. Nearly reaches masterpiece level with its storytelling and open world. A game that leaves a lasting impression.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I approached the game patiently and seriously. Its an unparalleled depicition of a broad range of realities and mentalities of different actors of people living in rural southern north america and the civil war-torn North Mexico in early 20th century. Apart from my apparent historic interest the story itself is a stripped down and narrow-goaled manhunt with a protagonist that seems stripped down and simple aswell, but both the quests and the protagonist are writtem and depicted in a way that is unyieldingly absorbent and hinting at an iceberg the player only scratches the surface of from a distance. So keep patient and observing, for me the game always payed off even if it has its few moments of anticlimatic emptiness of storytelling, bloated episodes that seem to stretch the game unnecessarily and hellishly long trailing missions that were avoid of joy or atmosphere.. Interesting plot, missions, Wild West atmosphere, and good graphics for an old game (played on Xbox One X) make it a fantastic game. However, I give it a 9 because there are some bugs.. Overrated as frick. Missions are boring, combat is awful,story is AWFUL, half of the game is driving a horse, rockstar has this structure for 20 years now and nobody criticises their games. Red Dead Redemption is a great game although marred with a few flaws the 2nd act of this game feels extremely drawn out and a little boring but the 1st act,3rd act and the final act are all wonderfully done. John is an awesome character a true family man. It's a lot of fun to play this game there's so many interesting characters. Awesome music! Gameplay is fantastic and mostly fast paced. Would recommended. An excellent atmospheric game, in some places it feels worse than Mafia 2, in some places it is better. In fact, the same GTA 4 only with horses and more elaborate.. A barely playable mess ****. Even at the time of release, this game was barely playable. Stiff movement, terrible controls, idiotic AI, the whole works. Rockstar have been making the same game time and again since GTA III and its clear as day in this rendition. Almost at 100% completion and its been an absolute slog, just because of how badly made it is. It can be hilarious at times, but not for the right reasons. How anyine has been giving this game more than a 6 or 7 over the last 13 years is hilarious, too.. While many look to acclaimed Sony studios such as Naughty Dog and Santa Monica for cinematic and impactful stories in gaming, the importance and influence of Rockstar cannot be understated within the medium. Not only is Red Dead Redemption a ridiculously fun time and an incredibly immersive game, its true strength at its core lies with its phenomenal characters and overarching story. The passion for this storyline has been shown by the hasty development of a sequel that grants further context for the motivations and past events of certain characters. As far as the gameplay, Red Dead contains many similar ideas to those seen in the Grand Theft Auto titles but with a genius Western twist. Being able to freely roam the entire world on horseback while coming across new areas and activities is truly liberating, and each side mission is carefully laid out within the main story. The map is of decent size and naturally opens up as you progress. Handling your horse and John himself is smooth, and the gunplay is particularly satisfying thanks to the Dead Eye mechanic. For 2010, the graphics hold up surprisingly well, and there is luckily a new remaster to smooth over certain textures. The sound design is also phenomenal, with great music throughout the entire journey. Narratively, I can only gripe that John spends a bit too much time with annoying characters that do little to further his adventure. From a gameplay perspective, I wish that there was a bit more variation to overall missions. My true complaints that keep this game from being a masterpiece stem from technical issues; I struggled with auto-saving problems, janky AI, and was forced to restart the console once. A bit more polish would have gone a long way for an otherwise outstanding game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Really great but in my opinion, not as good as its sequel. The story doesn’t feel as strong to me and it’s just not as fun. But it’s still great and fun enough. John’s redemption arc is one of my favorites after Arthur and Vader. Would highly recommend.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Great Game. Just the right balance of story and gameplay. The pace is great and it doesn't get bogged down like the sequel. This is a great Spaghetti Western with exciting missions.. I love this game, one of the best games ever made in videogames history. Is an experience to ride with John Marston around the West ️. This is a great game. Unfortunately, I played it for the first time only in 2023. The game does not impress as much as it could have impressed in the year of its release. But it's still fun to play. The graphics still look good in some places. Great characters, however, as always from Rock Star. And a great soundtrack.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is pretty good when you start out; you do all these activities that really make you feel like a cowboy/outlaw of the old west but eventually about half way through you’re forced to head to Mexico where the story and gameplay take a really fast dive. Why are we getting involved in some Mexican civil war? The only reason seems to be that Rockstar felt if they threw this in they could claim the game had some historical significance. Or that they didn’t have enough ideas for a full game and if they made this giant map you wouldn’t notice how empty the world and quests are. They’re pretty much all fetch quests around 5-10mins in length and the game’s favorite is to have you cut scene travel across the whole map, do the ‘mission’ and then it wraps up and leaves you there, no matter that the next quest is back on the other side of the map. Come on ride shotgun in the carriage! How this game ever won Game of the Year and got critics to herald it as one of the best video games ever made is beyond me. The game is downright boring and the ending has to be one of the worst ever made, not to mention then switching characters and now being left as this character 10 years later but you can continue to play quests you picked up as John Marston??. The game it's amazing! I have replayed recently and I can confirm: RDR it's one of the best games I ever played.. I'm reluctant to give 10/10 because today it does show some age. But I'm trying to think back to when I played this 13 years ago (it's hard to believe it's been this long). 13 years ago, this was my absolute favorite game. I loved it so much that as soon as I heard about Red dead 2 I preordered it, which was the first game I'd ever preordered. By todays merits i'd give it a solid 8/10. The only place it falls short today is the gameplay and other areas other the game are clunky.. Impactful story, interesting characters and nice gameplay. I prefer the 2nd one but this is undoubtedly a classic.. I played it on xbox one with backward compatibility. I must say, I didn't like the story and the quests that much. And random encounters on the open world is basically **** but the **** the ending is amazing, I was blown away by the ending.. Best western game ever ! (Better than the 2nd). Red Dead Redemption is more than just a video game; it's an immersive experience that sets the gold standard for open-world adventures. From its captivating storyline and well-developed characters to its breathtaking soundtrack, this game undoubtedly stands out as the pinnacle of its generation. The Story: At the heart of Red Dead Redemption lies a narrative that is both captivating and emotionally resonant. The game transports players to the American frontier during the decline of the Wild West, and it doesn't take long to become engrossed in the tale of John Marston. The protagonist's quest for redemption as he navigates the treacherous world of outlaws and lawmen is a rollercoaster of emotions. The intricately woven plot keeps players on the edge of their seats, and the moral choices they make have real consequences, making it a truly engaging experience. The Character:John Marston is not your typical video game hero. He's a complex and morally ambiguous character, making him all the more relatable and compelling. His evolution throughout the game, from a hardened outlaw to a man seeking redemption, is a testament to the exceptional character development in Red Dead Redemption. The supporting cast is equally well-crafted, making each interaction and mission feel meaningful. The Ending:Without giving away any spoilers, the conclusion of Red Dead Redemption is both poignant and memorable. It's a fitting climax to the journey players embark on with John Marston. The emotional weight of the ending is a testament to the exceptional storytelling and character development that Rockstar Games has achieved in this game. The hauntingly beautiful and evocative soundtrack of Red Dead Redemption sets the mood perfectly. Composed by Bill Elm and Woody Jackson, the music immerses players in the world of the game, enhancing the emotional impact of every moment. From riding through the prairies to intense gunfights, the score is a work of art that complements the game's atmosphere **** Conclusion:In summary, Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece of its generation. Its exceptional storytelling, complex characters, memorable ending, and evocative soundtrack combine to create an experience that transcends traditional gaming. It's a testament to the power of video games as a storytelling medium. If you haven't experienced it yet, it's time to saddle up and ride into the Wild West with John Marston – you won't be disappointed.. I beat it after Red Dead Redemption 2. And I loved every second of it. The writing is just amazing. 10/10 would play again!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Honestly, I don't like it at Red Dead Redemption. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Played the OG on Xbox 360. John Marston and this entires story go crazy. 3rd best rockstar game of all time imo. Behind Gta 5 and Red Dead 2. It's a good game but in the start it's pretty boring, but the more you progress the more fun it get's.. one of the best gamesof the PS3generationnot just greatopenword but a great storyandamazing ragdoll physics.. شخصیت پردازی شخصیت ها بسیار قوی است و من واقعا از آن لذت بردم The characterization of the characters is very strong and I really enjoyed it. Another masterpiece from Rockstar Games. Dubbed at the time as ""Grand Theft Horse"", Red Dead Redemption has stood the test of time and still holds up as one of the greatest open world games of all time and the second best western game of all time (right behind its successor). John Marston is a fantastic protagonist and all the side characters are equally fantastic. The story is gripping and deals with a lot of different issues that were going on around that time. The gunplay issome of Rockstars best. Itfeels like you're in a Tarantino western with how the rag doll ends body's flying. It makes for a really spectacular technical showcase that I don't think Rockstar have still topped to this day. The ""stranger"" missions in this game are some of the best side missions I have ever played. Particularly the mission strand ""I Know You"". This game is a masterpiece and is still an industry standard on how to do an open world game right. Official Score- 9.7/10. A truly great game and it’s fully backwards compatible to be played on the newer gen so play it if you don’t mind a little bit older graphics. It still has a great story and good gameplay. The online is surprisingly still fun and has people in it. If you like story games with combat and a big map and collectible guns, outfits, and properties then this would be a great game for you to play. Liars dice is also a highlight and poker of course. I 100% the game so you know I’m pretty much an expert.. Very good game . Impressive Graphics . Impressive Story . And Good Gameplay. Like Canis Canem Edit (AKA Bully) before it, Red Dead Redemption is the sandbox format of GTA transferred to a different environment, this time the wild west. It's all beautifully represented and technically very impressive, but like the aforementioned game the change of setting does little more than limit the scope of the missions and scenarios; they are always little more than ""ride to point A, shoot some people, then ride to point **** shoot some people"". As a whole it looks great and the story keeps you reasonably interested, but it lacks the variety, humour and likeable characters of GTA San Andreas.. After reading all 330 of the mixed reviews I found not one of them mentioned the game's most glaring flaw. GJ ppl, it's no wonder gaming continues to improve at such an incredible rate. It's a sandbox game made by control freaks who put systems in the game that punish the player for doing anything more than bumping into an NPC. It invalidates the point of the sandbox genre. If GTA III, VC, or SA had attached a permanent character penalty every time you ran over a pedestrian, they would not have been popular games. RDR should not be a popular game. For example, out in the middle of nowhere with no other people around, a law officer chased an outlaw to get his bounty. I stepped in to help, shot the bounty, and in response both the bounty and the officer start shooting at me. So I kill both, incur a -200 'Honor' penalty, and game pop-ups messages telling me it's going to lock my out of quests and erase my save file if I don't start playing like a nice boy. It's pants on head stupid, it completely defeats the purpose of the sandbox genre, and removes all the fun from the game. This is less like an actual game and more akin to some kind of virtual training simulator for dogs, where the players are the dogs, being trained to do completely pointless and unrewarding things for no purpose that they have to do anyways because that's what the designers wanted. The entire game is designed as an anti-fun just follow instructions control freak's training exercise. It's basically an interactive cut-scene simulator, where every single moment and every event that occurs in the game is scripted according to what the developers wanted or did not want the player to do. It has almost zero actual entertainment value, and as noted, not a single critique on this site leads to the game's most obvious flaw and are all basically invalid or I wouldn't have left this review.. one of the best games ever I played the game story and it game play are fantastic. This game captures the cowboy atmosphere better than almost anything. It's story and themes are heartbreaking and profound, and fitting for the era. Its gunplay is responsive and and it goes out of its way to offer depth to the non-combat life on the plains. Overall a tragic and profound experience, and a ton of fun.. In my 30 years of gaming, Red Dead Redemption is my favourite game to date. It’s a shame R* didn’t supersede this with RDR2. A true Masterpiece if you’re into Wild West movies and feel like taking the role of the lead character.. Like GTA games but with horses, except horses are nowhere as fun to use as a car or bike as you'd imagine. No cool radio to set the mood either cause you didn't have those back then. And just those two things alone make it a lot more boring, there's not a lot of interesting things to do and the story was pretty forgettable tbh. GTA with cars is better than with horses but overall Rockstar games are really overrated and its gameplay mechanics aren't particularly deep or rewarding. I tried to replay this game because tbh it looks really pretty and immersive but quit in the first hr because I just remembered how boring it was the first go round. Giving this game anything over a 7 is pure madness.. Her story is very beautiful And I recommend playing it to say the least because it is legendary. The story is amazing, emotional and the ending is just breathtaking, it takes the characteristic humor of Rockstar as always but makes a great narrative still. And the gameplay is as good and immersive as the story,. Update 3/31/23: I used to have this game on Xbox, Red Dead Redemption Digital Edition (the game itself is a 10/10) on Xbox, until Xbox banned my whole gamertag 15+ year old account with over $10k in digital games, movies, tv series, dlc all for something I posted in a GAME REVIEW yet they cant quote me as to what exactly I said and respond to my BBB complaint with ""we have no obligation to provide evidence"" when I violate their fragile ""TOS"". The multi-billion dollar business has no obligation to provide valid evidence for something so permanent as a PERMAMENT SUSPENSION FROM ACCESSING ANY OF YOUR PAID FOR CONTENT ON THEIR SYSTEM?!?! The thing **** CANT leave any real hateful comments and cuss words in reviews or XBOX doesn't even even save them, just blanks it out like you didn't type anything at all. Also I would've never said anything that warrants this kind of permament suspension, at worst I was talking crap on EAs Sims 4 predatory gaming practices of cutting a main game up and selling it to you in 20-$40 ""game & expansion packs"". So the suspension is complete BS, groups of circle jerks can get together and report something you typed as offensive and it auto-bans you and some lame gamer on a power-trip volunteering for their ""ambassador"" program (more circle jerks with fragile egos) reviews the ban and appeal. Boycott Xbox, they don't deserve your money with their ""woke"" parenting of even the lamest of things like GAME REVIEWS. I literally cant even sign into my account to access offline content, its ALL GONE thanks to an Abusive system MS lets auto-handle, the first miss steps of ""AI"". Buyers BEWARE. (END UPDATE) OLD POST FOLLOWS: Did I forget to go back and review one of the best games of all time?! Well let me rectify that situation, given the abolish spawns gaming hath given us since thy release of this classic. Story-A+, Graphics at the time A+, Character personality A+ Mission amounts and Side Mission content A+...this will forever be the pinnacle of gaming, because its been nothing but downhill since this game in the industry. So much so that I know Red Dead Redemption 2 coming up in a few months, wont live up to its older sibling in terms of old gamers familar with this series. This was back when ""DLC"" wasnt being chopped from the main game to be sold later, and once that trend started, games have been shallow and too short, for ""full"" experiences to be sold to you later for more $$. This company ""Rockstar"", used to have my upmost **** GTA V online ruined that. I fear, actually, I know, Red Dead Redemption 2 online will have low trickling pay offs for their in game $$ and way overpriced EVERYTHING just to try to get you to buy their in game currency ""Red Dead Bonds"" or some BS. You heard it hear first...I wont be buying Red Dead 2 until its on a huge sale or I just playing the single player when I can borrow a disk from a friend. I no longer tolerate, play, or recommend any game that models EA/Activision/Ubisoft and all the rests predatory game models. My wallet is closed like the rest should be until this industry changes its ways back to being consumer friendly and non predatory. Get ready for ""loot"" boxes in Red Dead 2 **** Red Dead Redemption, your legacy will never be forgotten.. This game is by far the best game on the Xbox 360, and one of the best games of all time! While RDR2 surpasses this game greatly, this game is still incredible!. One of the best games ever made!!! 1. Mr. John Marston's a good man! 2. I'd had an opportunity to play 'Red Dead Redemption 2' for a very short period of time and was more than impressed by the physics, gameplay mechanics, and other technical details done by RockStar Games. I thought of getting RDR2, but then thought to give it a try to RDR1 before RDR2 as I compared the graphics of both games. Personally, I would've not tried RDR1 after playing RDR2 as the graphics of RDR2, I feel, are exceptional. Keeping the graphics apart, I was stunned and surprised by the minute details RDR1 has. Details such as the sounds of horses’ shoes riding from one turf to another change the terrain sound, the ground's heat rising at distance, dust eroding while walking or moving wagon, NPCs getting annoyed if bumped into, etc. I have to mention that my friend persuaded me to take RDR1, and I was more than happy and pleased to play this game as all my friend's assertions were correct. 3. The main character's development and other characters in the game feel real while playing this video game. Apart from the main story missions, this open-world game took me by surprise regarding the Stranger Missions and the behavior patterns of such characters. The reactions of the Non-Player Characters while interacting with them were surreal all the time. Playing this game would make the player feel like living in the real old west world. 4. The dialogues and the grammatical language were fabulously scripted as they portrayed how people used to converse in that era. The advantages and disadvantages of both sides- outlaws/uncivilized and civilization can be inferred through the dialogues of the in-game characters. 5. Running on horses and playing missions give a very different feeling in this modern age. Action, thrill, adventure, and many items and aspects can be discovered while playing and exploring, apart from as well as while completing the main story! 6. The background score and the music in this game are simply great as they provide great intensity while playing, whether roaming free or doing missions. 7. All in all, the story is beautiful and enthralling at the same time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoil","after 14 years the game shows its age - both in terms of mechanics and, most importantly, at a technical level . if you’ve never played and you’re into westerns, this is still very much worth playing . if you keep the aim assist on, it’s also an enjoyable casual third person shooter ."
"490.WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!","Pretty good game, it's a very uniqe game, it's not like mario party, it just so uniqe. As much as I prefer the Wario land platformers this game is VERY fun to play. The amount of random **** in this game is funny, weird and Wario-like to the point where you might grow a zig zagged mustache. This game will make you like garlic so WATCH OUT!!. I was surprised at how good and funny it was. I appreciate how much there is to unlock. It got old fast though.. Best Wario game of all! It's very simple yet very hard to master. Finally no stupid blowing into the microphone or tilting the device, just simple button combinations. It's hard to belive that this game on GBA have best sound tracks of all wario games... It's ridiculous! Fast pace and lack of long boring cut scenes. After finishing that game I've realized that it's a shame that almost every other Wario games were treated like a benchmark for Nintendo consoles and they must use some weird unnecessary controls. That game is just the best. I just only wish that there could be more levels and that's why it's not a 10/10.. It's so cool and fun, one of the best Gameboy Advance games, the characthers are great and the idea of this series is original and awesome. This is a fine game and so fun and a blast to jump into, the bite size fast paced microgames makes it have it's own style.. This was one of the first GBA games I ever played and it was instantly a charming classic. Such an odd game with so many quirky moments and fast gameplay with the micro games. I loved how you can unlock mini games to play individually as well. It's a fun one to return to for a bit of nostalgia. If you're a GBA collector it should definitely be part of your collection!. Absolutely astounding amount of content in this game. Sure, it doesn't really have a story, but it has an amazing amount of replayability. Every microgame is fun and addictive and you can try and beat your own high score. Unlockable minigames like Sheriff and Dr Mario (Wario) will make it so that you will keep returning. A great pick up and play/time wasting game as well. One of my favourite GBA games. The graphic are good for GBA and have a somewhat quirky charm.. Normally I would rate a game on things like graphics or content or even music but this one was on what truly makes a game, This game was fun, that's it. It wasn't technically advanced in any way. The graphics weren't that amazing, the music was reused but the game was one of the most fun games that I have ever played. I could play this game with friends for hours and it would feel like minutes and that's what makes a good game. This one really surprised me honestly and I can't wait to see if they make something like this for the switch. This game really brought my family close together and is one of my favorite party games of all time. You won't find a load of fun and struggling anywhere else other than WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$! Look forward to those 213 microgames to start your fun and struggling.. I keep coming back to this one––I've been coming back to it for maybe 8 years now! Extremely enjoyable and perfect for some quick fun. You'll keep challenging yourself to beat your highest score, and that's exactly where the beauty of this game lies. For WiiU owners: get it now!. The game is really, really short (2 hours), but it was meant to be so. Replay value is what makes me keep playing again and again, and that is why feels seemingly filled with content, like a small sundae with an overload of chocolate sauce.. Some cool, great music and the cutscenes are fun, but the singleplayer campaign is designed to make you fail and try over and over again. It's a short game if you run through it, and the gameplay is too simple (timed single button presses) to make it fun by itself. The fun consists of your thought process in the moment you try to figure out the task. The artists/designers did a great job to try to make the game stand out, but what you're doing isn't really special in any way. Would be a really fun game for kids (bizarre kid friendly humor) if it wasn't punishing. No real reason to seek this out in 2013. A fun celebration of 'style over substance' nevertheless.","it's a very uniqe game, it's not like mario party, it just so uniqe . i appreciate how much there is to unlock. it got old fast though . it's so cool and fun, one of the best Gameboy Advance games ."
491.Grandia,"Grandia is an absolut masterpiece in story, music, world building… it’s an story about adventures and you truly feel like an adventurer while playing this game. Even if it’s an Ps1 game and you just see some pixels with some pictures which show you the emotions, you can feel every emotion the Charakters are feeling. The gameplay is also very creative how you level up you’re skills and how you combine all the element magic. Everyone who loves JRPGs should play this awesome game.. + Characters develop / grow+ Battle system takes the best of both action and turn based combat+ Battle system provides replay ability+ Adventure is Romanticize / feels like one+ Story isn't traditional / interesting~ Voice acting in english is decent at best~ Pacing can be off putting at first~ Not really challenging- Constant loading times between certain menus- Can't skip attack animations- Literal backtracking seems more like padding. I love Grandia with all of my heart! Played it as a kid, replayed it several times by now. The graphics are charming, the battles are a perfect mix of turn-based and real-time action, and the characters are lovable. The story is a rollercoaster ride of emotions, and the soundtrack is top-notch. Just play it.. A unique world which truly gives a sense of adventure. Iconic characters and music. Fun combat. Great story. One of the best JRPGs of all time. Plays great even in 2023. Combat is fun and upgrade system is addicting, auto fights are great for grinding. Environments are rich and everchanging, supported by great soundtrack. Story is intriguing, full of unexpected turns. Highly recommended for jrpg fans.. Grandia Genre: JRPG Age Rating: Teen Original System: Sega Saturn Original Release Date: 1997 Visuals: 7 - Though the 3D graphics are a bit dated by more modern standards, the 2D sprites are very detailed and is always easy to tell what actions the characters are doing. The animated cut-scenes are absolutely beautiful too. Audio: 6 - Sound effects are outstanding and very fitting. Voice acting is good and emotional (only played with Japanese voice acting, so the English voice acting is not considered in score). Music can range from mostly forgettable to genre inspiring! Story: 9 - The plot and characters of Grandia is full of life and wonder. The adventure the player embarks on will bring smiles to your face and tears down your cheeks for happy and sad reasons. Gameplay: 6 - Gameplay consists of standard JRPG tropes of exploring towns and dungeons fighting enemies, opening chests for loot, leveling up and talking to NPCs. Items appear frenquently and even represent what they are on the field before picking them up. It is always very exciting to find a new item on the ground and then figure out a way to get to them. NPCs are where this game really stand out. In Grandia very nearly every NPC has Multiple things to say and they change at what seems to be any small change in the plot. They also directly talk to certain characters in the party and even better, a good amount of the time a party member repsonds or reacts to what the NPCs say. I highly recommend taking the time to talk to NPCs as often as possible. Combat is basically turn based but with bars that need to fill before a character or enemy can act. In battle characters and enemies move about the screen, sometimes seemingly random, and stop when it is your turn to act. Actions can range from regular attacks, magic attacks, special attacks, critical attacks, defending, evading, using items and running away. There is a lot of complexity to combat, enemies have their own weaknesses and strengths and there is a good amount of strategies and options the player can take advantage of in combat. A frustrating flaw to combat that would appear every so often is that if a character is too for away or can't reach an enemy after an action is selected, the character would give up after a while and waste that turn. Another battle quirk that frustrated me personally is that there are many AOE attacks enemies have and it seems impossible to separate characters to keep all of them from getting hit, though it could just be me not understanding that particular part of the game. (Did I mention that this battle system is complex?) In Grandia The player can level up their proficiency in weapons they use, magic atrtibutes they learn and their overall stats. As typical for almost any RPG get enough EXP from killing enemies and characters will level up and better their stats. Magic and weapons only level up if the character uses them and it can lead to some extra grinding or some less effective battles specifically to increase one or both of these. Difficulty: 7 - Grandia is not as old as some other JRPGs so it doesn't try to break your spirit like some old classics, but that does not mean the game holds your hand. Knowing where to go is not a problem and since enemies appear on the field, instead of randomly encountered, it is hard to get screwed by an unlucky encounter. Actually battling, on the other hand, is where the difficulty lies. To my knowledge the game doesn't let it be known or really even hints most of the time what enemy is weak to or strong against for the most part. It is up to the player to try everything they have to see what weakness their enemy has, which can lead to botched first tries. While playing I battled every enemy I saw on screen even if they weren't in the way, while using them to increase a magic attribute or weapon level, because I do not like to grind in any game. Enemies and bosses for the most part did not pose too much of a threat for most of the game but, especially towards the end, bosses became more numerous and much tougher. I can imagine a Player rushing through levels just to see the next cut-scenes are going to have a very tough time and a lot of grinding later on. Grinding is a big factor in terms of difficulty to me personally. I did not grind in my play through, but on the last few bosses I had to use my tiny brain to its max to win.....with some luck. Final thoughts In the end Grandia is a Superb game that will stay with the player that is willing to put in the work and time to achieve victory late game. The visuals, audio and Story weave together to make a very moving, inspiring and fun adventure for players of all ages. The best way to play this game is through the HD remaster. I bought it online for $19.99 and it is worth every penny.. For a PS1/ Dreamcast rpg, this game is absolutely phenomenal. Pros: - Insanely good battle mode and leveling up skills, my favorite about this game. - Great characters with good chemistry and interact with each other alot - Long rpg, with adventure mindset and many places to visit. - For its limitations of its console, its actually **** how amazing the game looks - Disc 1 is by far the most best experience that the game offers. - Buncha towns to explore, very lively atmosphere, so much details and stories to explore if you look for them. Just how an rpg should be. Cons: - Terrible camera and its hard to get use to or enjoy the dungeons because of it. - Fun music that seems to be sometimes playing for 15 secs then starts over on a forever loop, i thought the audio for this game needed some serious update for the remaster but its still pretty unpolished. The volcano section and its village i have to turn of the audio completely the whole time. - Disc 2 is 3/10 to me, i hate how the story went from being adventurous kids on a boat visiting new places and just having fun - into terrible anime plot that wasnt enjoyable at all. Disc 1 is 9/10 to me but the last 10 hours was dreadful in terms of story, characters and basically everything, i thought it really fell apart at the end. Overall one of my favorite jrpg's by far but i really dislike how unsatisfying the last 10 hours were, otherwise it's an easy 9/10 for me. A rich experience and few jrpg's match the creativity Grandia 1 exudes.. For its time a great RPG with some flaws. Lets start with the good things: The story and characters are charming (Be warned here too. It is the kind that can also be annoying for others), the battle system was refreshing and the humor works well. On the negative side the localization is poor, its starts a bit slow and for the magic system I should give you a warning later on. Just for clarification: The game is now really old and does of cause not hold up in the technical and graphics categories. This however can not be hold against the game but I think the warning is fair (Also some people say it was not that good graphically back then). It is the story of teenager Justin who sets out to be an adventurer like his vanished father. He is still a bit naive but has the hearth of a hero. His adventure will become much greater and impactful than he had imagined in his wildest dreams. Firstly it sounds and look like a cheesy and child-friendly story but the plot deals with some serious issues and it is the good kind of cheesy. I already warned you that it is also the kind of story and characters that can annoy you. Even if I enjoyed it a lot I can fully see why others dislike the story and characters. For me I enjoyed the main and side characters. There is a lot of character development and interaction that never fails to deliver. It was satisfying and enjoyable in this regard. They also get the mixture of humor and seriousness right. The humor in particular was great. Be it for example the accident on the ship with Feena, the dealing with Nana, Saki and Mio or miss-expectations that lead to hilarious situations (Special mention the whole Justin to the rescue of beautiful helpless females arc;-). Lets continue with the game play. The battle system has some interesting mechanics. You can see enemies and depending how you engage or the enemies vice versa can get the initiative (Touch them behind and avoid the opposite). Then the battle starts. It is close to the Final Fantasy active time turn based battles but with a twist. There is an IP bar that shows which party member or enemy will act next. If you reach a marker you can input your command. The twist is that you have to reach the next marker to execute the command. This gives tactical options as special attacks and powerful magics take longer to perform. It is possible to cancel attacks or delay your enemies and vice versa. For this you have a fast and strong normal basic attack. Some special attacks and magic will also do the trick. It total this was a good system that added tactical depth to the battles. For special attacks: Each character has a set of weapons he / she can use. If you use these they level up and get stronger. If you fulfill the requirements you learn new skills. Beware not all skills can be used with other weapons like for example a whip attack is not possible to use with a knife. Magic: I like the system but hate how you have to unlock magic. You have no access to magic until you find a special item which was called fairy egg if I remember correctly. With each you can unlock one element (Fire, water, earth and wind. Since we don't have love no Captain Planet support for us;-). Those work like weapons. If you use them you level them up and gain access to better spells. There are overlaps like multi element spells and elemental (weapon) special attacks. Be warned that there is a finite amount of fairy eggs and these are missable. What makes this worse is that not all party members are permanent. You can waste some on characters that leave the party permanently. I think I give you the final party composition for you to plan as it helps at the end of the review with a spoiler warning. Again the total battle and ability system works great and I beat the game multiple times from beginning to end. There are also 3 bonus dungeons which are not connected to the story. These have very good items, some additional fairy eggs and strong bosses. Presentation wise the game has a unique style but the graphics divided the players already back then. Some said it was already outdated. The soundtrack is still good but the voice acting is awful. This was screwed in the localization. Overall this was a remarkable good game back then and I enjoyed it a lot. Maybe not up to date but it still has charm and good characters. SPOILER: Final party consist of: Justin, Feena, Rapp and Liete. Only use fairy eggs on those.. One of the best rpg´s ever made. A must play game. The story is fantastic. The combat system is unic and awesome.. This game inspired me when I was young. It has the most beautiful wholesome story. You can't help but be in a great mood playing this game. I even encouraged my husband who never plays RPG'S to try it and he loves it. I feel that I'll never be able to articulate well enough how amazing this game is. :D. Played on PlayStation. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GOOD. Control/Dialogue: GOOD.. Cast: 7/10 Story: 5/10 Fun: 5/10 Gameplay: 6/10 Not Recommended ----------------------. Cute, fun RPG about adventure that is just all around a good time. It does the RPG formula well with charming character designs, a simple yet fun plot, and a battle system that keeps the turn-based standard fun and interesting. Dungeons seem a little long at times, but feel rewarding for getting past them. The art direction in this game is simply beautiful! A great addition to the Playstation's RPG library, and one that still plays well and is enjoyable to this day.. Quite..strange to write a review 18 years after playing it. BUT I saw this mixed score and I couldn't believe what I saw. Are people stupid? Yes people are stupid. I can sadly understand why this game did not get out of FFVII shadow back then, because it hit a more popular nerve and being released on Saturn first. I was bored back then and rented this game 3 days and thought this game might appeal to me. Then got hooked so pretty bad by every single characteristic of that game, that I amassed rental penalty fees. Then I had to return it...next weekend I rented it again and faked being ill at school to be able to complete the most emotional, passionate adventure story with the most likeable main characters I ever witnessed in a game. This adventurous passion the game **** don't even get me started with the OST arranged at Skywalker sounds, best game score I ever listened to. Back then the battlesystem is also to be mentioned as revolutionary fresh and superb, THIS ladies and gentleman is not any game, THIS is not any JRPG. This game is the pinnacle of JRPG and for me even games alltogether with (FFVII quite side by side). I play videogames since 1989 across many platforms and those two games are on top of it all. If I would believe in God I would wish for a proper remastered version of this game (without doing much changes...). The 3-4 times I completed this game was not enough. Sadly the sequels are not even on the same level, but hey... Square also kind of failed FF series over time, so.... Grandia 1 was my 1st rpg game for the Playstation 1. I was totally enjoying it as a kid. The hard thing about this time was that I did not know any english words at all so it was rlly hard to explore that game but I did manage to finish it. I played that game so often and long that I even could beat Gadwin in the 1st battle you met him but the game still told me that I've lost. Well yeah the skill system was also rlly nice. You could lvl up earth to lvl 99 and water had a rlly cool lvling up way like standing infrond of a trap and taking damage untill you end up with 1 hp left then open the menu and heal yourself to max ofcourse it worked best near a savepoint to refill the manapoints aswell. This method made it easy to reach water lvl 99 really early in the game. It had allot of funny situations. The character are really amazing. I totally liked Sue and her little pet. Hope to play this game again as a HD remastered version for PS4 or PC. Just an amazing game and everyone who loves rpg should play it.. This game would be much more appreciated if it had fewer dungeons and towns; it way overstays its welcome.. I feel when reviewing a game, the date it was released has to be considered. During its time, Grandia rivaled Final Fantasy 7 as the best RPG to date-- and in many ways surpassed it. A grand adventure that was light-hearted with a sense of humor but also a deep story with many happenings to keep you on your toes. As the story progresses, so do the characters. The battle system was cutting edge with the ability to level up weapons and magic separate from your character. Put it all together and you have Grandia. The cartoon-ish graphics don't work for most games, but in my opinion they combine with other elements of this game perfectly.. The game has some very witty and funny dialogues. Also, the display photos of the characters when they talk to show how they feel are just so expressive. The characters are easily some of the most memorable I've seen in a game.﻿. I played this game for the first time ever this year on my PS Vita and I had a blast playing through it. I love Grandia 2 and playing through the first one seemed like a great idea. It has almost everything that I loved about Grandia 2. The great fluid combat system, a not so complicated way to upgrade your characters, a solid story with some fantastic music. The visuals are obviously lacking by today's standards but they are very charming and I honestly had no problem with them, only a few times some of the areas were a bit hard to navigate due to the graphics. If you love old school JRPG's this one is simple to wrap your head around and is a really fun time. I spent around 60+ hours playing through the whole story so prepare for a long journey if you decide to try it out.. Grandia is a very good JRPG because it has a great story and a gameplay. The story is inspirational because through Justin they shows that we should never give up on our dreams. The story has everything: happy, sad, funny, dramatic and tragic moments. The main themes of the story are adventure, drama and dreams, but they also show human greed. The gameplay is great, I especially like the battle system. The idea of changing the characters in a party through the story is great because it allows the player to use all the characters in the battle. The battle system in Grandia games is one of my favorite because it is similar to the ATB system. Unlike the ATB system, it is more active and is much faster which makes it more interesting. This game deserves remake. They should revive this great JRPG so that new generations can enjoy Justin's adventure. With a brand new graphics and improved battle system from Grandia III, and with the same gameplay as the original, the remake should look perfect on PS4. Also, they could make a direct sequel of the first Grandia game. The story should continue where the first Grandia game ended. After defeating Gaia, Justin and Feena go to a new adventure where they discover a new continent which is located south of Elencia. On this new continent they found a strange relic which may be related to ancient civilization. They wanted to discover the secret of that strange relic, but Feena soon became pregnant and after the children are born it was difficult to continue the investigation of a strange relic. After ten years, Justin and Feena decided to return to Parm with their children. Year passes and they completely forgot about a strange relic. Fifteen years later, Justin and Feena's daughter Xeena finds a strange relic in grandmother's home (Seagull Restaurant). After learning something about a strange relic, Xeena decided to become a great adventurer like his parents and continue where they stop with their investigation. So Xeena went to the new continent to solve the mystery of a strange relic. On her journey she meets new people and humanoids, creates new friendships, falls in love, her Icarians power awaken and save the world from new threats. With a similar style of gameplay as in the first Grandia game and with an improved battle system from Grandia III, and with this story the new Grandia game would be great on PS4. They should definitely revive the Grandia series.. Grandia is a game that sparked my fascination with RPG's when I was a young child, along with Final Fantasy IX (and X shortly after that). The visuals are well done, the story is great, and the audio is fantastic (aside from a few voice actors like Justin and Sue's characters). And the soundtrack, oh that soundtrack. Words cannot describe how amazingly fantastic the music is. It was one of the first games to have a fully featured soundtrack. Personally, this is still my favorite game soundtrack ever. The gameplay is also expertly designed and insanely fun...under the right circumstances. The base game is horribly imbalanced, with many spells, skills, and items completely useless. It is an extremely easy game. I had to dock off a point for this only fault. This issue is easily fixed however, with the mod called ""Grandia Redux."" Look it up and play it. It changes the balance of gameplay to be challenging and rewarding, and easily makes the game a 10/10.. Really? Mixed ratings? Oh my this can't be! And 23 bad reviews right now? Why! This game is amazing but I do think that Grandia 2 is better but this is still great.. I'd like to keep this review short and reasonable. Grandia is a J-RPG game that first came out to the Sega saturn but later was ported to PS1, it was one of my first introductions to an RPG and that includes FF8 and FF9. Anyway, Grandia stood out on it's own with it's design and colorful story that really made it feel like you were destined for ''grand'' adventure. With an unique combat system that this game was praised for and some of the best soundtrack composed to fit in every mood in the game it was easy to fall in love. Let me summarise with the pros and cons. Pros. - Well phased story that didn't overstay its welcome. - Pretty pixelated graphics on a 3D landscape - Unique fighting system - Likeable characters - Three rewarding sidequests that extends gameplay. - 60-80 hours of gameplay. - Great soundtrack Cons - Voice acting hasn't aged well. - Sound effects seem to desync sometimes. - Enemies do not scale on your level. - Camera tends to get obstructed (this rarely happens). Grandia in a word is: Excellent. New gamers may think the story drags or is too long. BUT! that's how a RPG is supposed to be, you know. Do not confuse story telling with the game dragging. From beginning to end, this is one of my favorite games on the PSX. A real RPG game, not like the current games that focuses too much on ""fan service"" leaving everything else aside. ""New RPG's"" should learn from this. Can't really complain about anything. Progression, leveling, enemy encounters, every single thing is just amazingly done. Can't find a single fault. 11 out of 10.. Not only the characters are epic designed but also the story is. It may begin with a kid who's playing around and imagining of be on a adventure but it ends with an epic guy who's got the blessing of the spirits holding their sword and fighting against evil. I like the anime art they included. Its really epic,my first and favorite rpg as good as ff7 or even better. The way the main character deals with some situations is just good and the music is like someone mixed all epic soundtracks together into one track and presents it to you with gods earphone affiliated to the mp3 player. This game changed my life and my behavior and it's really worth play it.. This is my favorite Playstation game I first started playing it when it first came out and still enjoy it today. It a really easy game and fun to play and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.. Grandia showcases one of the best RPG combat systems ever developed. The combat mechanics paired with a passable storyline and colorful characters makes Grandia one for the collection.. This is the best game I have played till now. I loved every single moment of that game. The characters, the gameplay back in time, the History of never giving up. When Justin climbs that huge wall that divides the world and discovers a whole New World to be explored, it´s simply amazing. The love between Justin and Feena. The sad moments. Everything about the first Grandia is brilliant.. A long adventure with a naive but touching story, nice characters, good battle system and lots of ingame details. The worst things are tedious random battles and awful navigation, though I still enjoyed the game.. This is a great adventure with endearing characters, lively towns, and fun combat. The attention to detail is much higher than other games of the time. The interaction between the characters as well as the expressions on their portraits during dialogue is excellent. This game is absolutely gorgeous and the character sprites will stand the test of time compared to early polygonal characters in other games (look at cloud in FF7) My only two issues with the game were to lack of field maps and the casting of spells took much longer than necessary, but they were still awesome. ""Come power of the Universe! HA!!!!! Dragon King Slice!!"". The game becomes long and drawn out towards the end which does the game no favors in terms of enjoyment and the dialogue and plot is very, very cheesy. the battle system and magic and abilities was solid and kept me playing in what was otherwise your typical but overly cheesified cheese fest **** that wasn't great in anyway shape or form. Oh yes, and Justin seriously began to grate on me too. graphics 4/10 game play 7/10 story 3/10. The game is worth playing for the battle system alone. The characters and story are dumb, and i just couldnt wait for the game to end, it dragged on and on.. Things which seemed epic when you were fourteen don't usually stand the test of time. Grandia with its shambling plot and cringe-worthy anime moments fits squarely into this bracket.","Grandia is an absolute masterpiece in story, music, world building... you truly feel like an adventurer while playing this game . even if it’s an Ps1 game and you just see some pixels with some pictures which show you the emotions, you can feel every emotion the Charakters are feeling . the gameplay is also very creative how you level up your skills and how you combine all the element magic ."
493.Colors! 3D,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. What makes Colours 3D superior to painting apps you might have on your phone is the obvious inclusion of 3D. So now you can paint anything you want to have much more depth. It's a breakthrough in art. You can also look at other people's amazing drawings, and submit your own (though I wouldn't dare!). You can also play a fast-forward video of the painting. Seriously, what some people can do with it is just incredible. The only thing I dislike is the menu system for brush types, colours, and things like that.. A fantastic drawing application with many layers to make 3D pictures, you can even make animation in it if you get the hang of it. There are a fantastic amount of tools for you to use. There is also a massive online community built into the application where you watch watch tutorials and look at how everyone's drawings are done for inspiration.. Colors! 3D is the best painting tool I have used. It's less complicated than Art Academy, and it allows you rub out what you have done at any time. The online database of the thousands of paintings is a very very good feature, as you get ""likes"" for each painting, it really does drag you in with this feature. Now the actual painting tool itself is very robust, simple to use but hard to master, it has an undo function (which is very handy). The colour mixing system is very well done and easy to use to great effect. The 3D also is easy enough to use simply, but can be hard to master. However, it does not get a ten for a few reasons, after a while of painting the ""undo"" function stops working. Whilst viewing the online gallery, it can crash, relatively often this happens, dampening the overall experience. And the final fault of the game is that you cannot search for paintings, or artists (as you can on the website on the computer) which means paintings are often ignored and do not get the recognition they deserve. Bottom line: If you want a simple, yet robust painting tool for the 3DS, this is the one!. This is not a game, this is a painting application. Just thought i'd get that out of the way first so there's no confusion. that being said, it's a rather robust and somewhat intuitive painting application and the inclusion of painting in 3d (which is actually more like slices akin to the multi-planar camera from animation days past) is pretty darn good! IF you don't have an artistic bone in your body and you can't even draw a stick figure to save your life, avoid this application as you're probably going to consider it wasted money... IF, however, you like painting/drawing or you're keen on learning, it's certainly worth considering. the screen size is a bit of a trade-off for portability but that's a rather small price to pay in my personal opinion.. Amazing its one of my most fav apps on 3DS love online gallery its great place see other artists works and show off you own:) the interface is simply and great to use and its worth every penny:D enough said:P. ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS DL IS TO LOOK AT THIS (and watch the ""video"" that shows its creation): ****. Also, I am not saying just anyone can accomplish that phenomenal painting, but the point is that it shows the ability of Colors! 3D. If you are an artist, you can make a masterpiece and finally show it in 3D (to a point, there are 6 ""layers"" of depth). It isn't great for making an object seem like it is moving from one plane to another, but it is amazing when you are trying to put objects behind or in front of another. Just look at some of the forestry that people have made and you will 100% understand the awesome potential of this for artists. Those lions were CREATED on the 3DS and look that flawless. The possibilities are endless. I think for true artists used to one-dimensional painting/drawing, this could be a game-changer. This is a new medium, and to call it anything less is denying where this could eventually lead. I, by no means am, but I have been mesmerized by painting after painting in the gallery. Some would rock considered what tiny screen they were created on even in 2D, but some people have truly embraced the possibilities of still 3D art. And for $6.99, I cannot be missed if you have a 3DS. You'll spend more time looking at other people's work than making your own in some cases, and it still will be worth far more than you paid.. I remember playing this on my DS that had a flashcart. It was one of my favourite home-brewed pieces of software out there. Fast forward a few years: it's great to see it get full official support and become one of the best apps on the 3DS! It's really easy to use and the 3D effect is really good! It's like a mini Corel Draw/Photoshop in your pocket, minus the $500-900 pricetag!. A relatively cheap way to have fun, whether or not you are a good artist. There's a lot you can do with the app and the layering to add 3D to the drawings really make more room for creativity. You can have up to 5 layers, and the controls for colors! 3D are very easy to use. Worth the $6.99 it costs.","colours! 3D is a fantastic drawing application with many layers to make 3D pictures . it's less complicated than Art Academy, and it allows you rub out what you have done at any time . the actual painting tool itself is very robust, simple to use but hard to master ."
494.NBA 2K11,"Still enjoyable in 2023, graphics still look realistic thanks to the 360° photo shootings the NBA does with the players. Also when creating players they can visually get really close to the real ones. Moves are certainly more limited than in newer 2K games. Overall I like the graphics, menu, casters and gameplay more than in newer 2K games (2K12-2K18) for the Xbox 360.. Greatest 2K game I’ve ever played. The gameplay and everything about it felt extremely deep and fun. Animations are also great. Almost anything you think of from the PS2 era for NBA Live, IS in 2K11. Never seen a game this.... GREAT, since NBA Live 05. 2K11 is just an incredible piece of art and playing this now, shows how much 2K cares about their games, even in 2010! It just hits different. Like I said, best basketball game I’ve ever played.. Where to start, well first the animations are awful and gameplay doesn’t hold up, but it doesn’t have to with the time of great game modes. I have had this game for over a year now, and am still playing it. Probably have logged in about 50 hours already and is still hooked as ever. That should say enough.. NBA2K11 is hands down the best basketball game ever made. it's only flaw coming in the ""My Player"" mode where you must play all 82 games, which takes too much time. However, it offers easy and learn able controls, and it's overall fun. Even if you're not a huge B-Ball fan, you'll enjoy this game.. Instead of being a case of diminishing returns, NBA 2K11 sees the franchise in peak condition. The inclusion of the sport's greatest player is much more than just a stunt for the cover and resurrects a time in basketball that we remember fondly. Nostalgia aside, NBA 2K11 is much like Air Jordan himself. This game really was a big let down for me, and it took me several hours of frustrating gameplay to nail down what bothered me so much about it. I'm a long standing fan of the NBA Live series, but thought I would give 2k 11 a chance. The first thing that hit me is just how much crap you have to sit through, with sponsored replays, timeouts, half time dancing girls, all the time the game is taking the control away from you so you can stare at what is essentially a giant billboard. The controls are some of the most sluggish and unintuitive I have ever played and had me red in the face with frustration when even simple moves or plays fall flat because my team appear to have suffered serious brain trauma and can't get that superglue off their feet. Seriously will never come back to this series, I appreciate its trying to bring a high level of realism to the table but the dreadful control system, shameless advertising and endless parade of minor annoyances make me regret spending what little money I did on it. Avoid at all costs. Great Game. Great game modes. But there some bugs. Like creating a character, you cant customize the face size and other features. But other than that its a great game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One of my favorite sports games of all time. Everything offline is fantastic. From association mode to My Player, you can't really go wrong. Given the fantasy draft option for association mode, and the ability to play 12 minutes quarters and 82 game seasons for each of the 5 positions you can create in My Player gives this game virtually infinite replayability. I was playing it all the way from launch until the release of 2K12. The only real drawback is the online. 2K's servers are absolute trash. But like I said, this game is fantastic as a single player experience, or a local one with friends. The lack of a strong online component detracts very little.. Here's the deal,I grew up in Chicago,I love Michael Jordan and the bulls I played basketball from age 5 to 25 and I'm 38 years old,so put it **** wait your whole life for a game like this and most of the time it doesn't happen but guess what--It happened.I would probably love it even if it was a crap game but it's the best basketball game ever made to the date of 10-2010.I can't even count the times I made Jordan in past basketball title but..that's the **** game,well the presentation is bar none the graphics are real,The sound is awesome and the game play is a game with a replay value where there is no end cause it's so freaking awesome.2K's football titles in the past on the xbox used to be so ahead of there time that it would give me the chills and I'm back to that **** can make you an emotional mess than it's one of a kind and Love it Jordan fans cause there will probably never be another game where the focus is so high on Michael Jordan.Ladies and gentlemen the greatest basketball player of all time is back in the spotlight and he's hotter then ever!. This game might be old but I decided to give my two cents. Before 2K12, this was the best basketball game ever. Ignore those people making bad reviews. It sounds like ALL of them do NOT know how to even play 2K ball. 2K10 was one of the worst to have come out on the 360. 2K11 is much more smooth and fun than it's predecessor. The game felt more complete. The Jordan Challenges are a nice feature. You were put in 10 of MJ's most memorable games. (Like dropping 63 Points on the Celtics or humiliating a Drexler-led Trailblazer team with Jordan dropping 6 threes in the first half for an NBA Finals record) My Player was decent. It had the draft combine which was DLC for NBA 2k10. Quite similar to 2K10's My Player but was a little bit more improved. For the price of this right now it is quite a steal.. This game is the basketball game you have been waiting for your whole life.I'm from Chicago so you know how happy I am sense I watched just about ever game Michael Jordan and the bulls played throughout the whole 90's.Even if it was a different star like Dr. J it still would of been ****'s just an added bonus for me.Honestly the passing is a bit off with the players sometimes acting like there psychic but I am not going to knock it for that because that really is all that I see is a bit **** this has to be played to be **** makes all NBA Live's games and the other past 2K games obsolete.. it can be super hard and frustrating, but this is seriously one the most addicting and fun sports games i have played in a while... Player ratings are a little on the unrealistic side learning curve is steep so many addicting modes.... association, myplayer (**** you in) and the jordan stuff is awesome series will only get better only qualm is the online servers just seem to be terrible, super laggy (basically have to play nba jam style and constantly dunk) but yeah.. get over the learning curve and get into it! (still much more accessible than madden and other spots games). This is a really great game. If you are new to basketball and or aren't that interested in the sport, don't buy this game. However, if you are in love with the game absolutely buy this game. It's the most realistic sim I've ever played. It is frustrating at first because it's so difficult but if you continue to play the game and get better it is extremely rewarding. Hands down the best sports game I've ever played.. I don't know what game the reviewers played, but this game is simply not fun. Not accessible at all, you'd need to put in dozens of hours of at least to even have a chance against the AI on standard difficulty, and the canned animations frequently cause you to do things you don't want to. Further, being forced to run plays in my player mode makes the game unfun: at best you get a wide open shot that simply comes down to correctly pushing a button (or wiggling a stick). While realistic, this isn't very rewarding, especially when it happens as rarely as it does (most plays simply entail you running around and setting a pick for someone). Which is really a microcosm of the whole game; realistic but not rewarding.. Every year 2k increases the amount of player animation on both offense and defense which gives us less and less split-second control. 4 out of 5 times you won't be able to take advantage of pump-faking your defender into the air because it takes 2 seconds of animation to go where you want to go, nevermind not being able to take a jumpshot exactly where you'd like to, either. Also, the unpredictable animation will make your jumpshots inconsistent now that shot releases for some players are unfairly quick. When you are defending the animation punishes you heavily for pressing to one side a little too much. If this franchise wants to keep it's simulation reputation it better start giving back full control to the player - more animated moves does not accomplish this. Oh yes, and after they updated the game to force mandatory play-calling for the My Player mode, I stopped playing it. It totally changed and wrecked the game for me. I will not buy 2k12 if this is not changed back. Everything else, especially the presentation, is great. The amount of animation and mandatory play-calling for My Player mode ruined it for me.. NBA 2K11 is the best NBA game to date, the gameplay is realistic, the presentation of the game is awesome and the sound is amazing although the commentatery could be better, the Micheal Jordan content adds hours to this already massive game. I would highly recommend to anyone.. Its Amazing So Amazing. Playing Michael Jordan and competing against some of the best players in NBA history is awesome. You can play against Dominique Wilkens and see him do some insane dunks, play against Jazz Duo Stockton & Malone, watch Patrick Ewing dominate the post, its just awesome. The controls are a little tough to handle. You might lose for a while, but after you get use to the controllers sooner or later youll start to dominate. Also while playing a game, you feel like your watching a live NBA game, people passing by will ask you who's playing. Franchise mode is always fun, building your team to win a championship is cool, but your always gonna get the Lakers or Heat in the finals. great gameplay, good graphics, great commentary in game, also great music playlist. All around great game.. The only game feature that drew me to this game was my player mode. 2k10 was the first game I ever played in this franchise and it blew me away. 2k11 improves on graphics, animations and neat new features like the Michael Jordon mode which adds in the chance to play as teams from the 80's & 90's. Playing in short shorts was awesome! The 2k basketball franchise is so solid, variable and so complex that it is nearly like watching a real basketball game. The winning formula of realistic gameplay and the many great game modes **** you in. In regards to the controls and learning moves the game has a steep learning curve but it is well worth it.. OK, while I understand some of the criticisms from reviewers who gave 2k11 low marks, there are a few ways to look at it. I play my friends locally and online and I have an absolute blast. In player v. player competition, the game has never been better. In fact, this is right there with FIFA 10 as the most innovative and most complete sports titles I've ever played. The dynasty is deep and well balanced but I do have complaints, too, especially if done with friends. On the down side: almost unplayable against the computer. Extremely frustrating on darn near every setting except rookie, which is way too easy. I won my first game on rookie by 85 and shot 81 percent. Boring. The Jordan experience left a lot to be desired, as well. Lastly, in dynasty mode there seems to be no rhyme or reason to what makes a team good. My team of LeBron James, Blake Griffin, George Hill, Mark Gasol and Ty Lawson went 42-42 and missed the playoffs but the team that won had D-Wade and that was about it. The team had five power forwards and the PG was T.J. Ford. Umm... what? After rambling, this game is a 10 if your playing friends and having a competitive dynasty. If your going it alone, it's about a 6.. They made a lot of stuff really nice, there is a lot of customization in creating players, building teams, everything. It lets you automate the intricacies of being a coach in game so you can focus on playing, or you can take full control yourself. All this would normally make for a great basketball game, if it weren't for one thing. The controls are horribly sluggish and inconsistent. I have had instances where i had a clear fast break, hit the shoot button 5 feet from the basket, and the player ran past and out of bounds, then tried to shoot. 5 minutes later, i had the same type of fast break, shot 6 feet away and the player stopped on a dime and did a jump shot. When trying to beat a defender, even if you have a clear lane, your player will slow down and some times turn around(!) when you are telling him to charge through. These types of problems would just be annoying, except when the computer gets in the same situations and worse (heavily defended) the player will just charge through and your players move out of the way. Basketball requires fast reactions, and when it takes a full second for players to respond to your button presses if they don't decide to out right ignore them, it makes the game simply unplayable. One more problem i have pales in comparison to the glaring control issue is what i will call turbo mode, this is where your players will actually move at more than a leisurely walk and will generally put more umf! into their actions. It lasts way to short for what it does. Any basketball player that couldn't go at more than a light jog for 5 seconds would quickly be out of work, but that is the standard in 2k11. I haven't played a basketball game with a controller since live 1995 (i tried the wii, but had issues with the remote registering the wrong commands) so maybe this is just how NBA games are now, but i sure don't like it.. Incredible game! Needless to say that the whole jordan thing rocks and if u were watching him at the time a kind of nostalgia will rule you....... Association:Great! i believe the best mode in the whole game.Myplayer:Very good even if i sometimes get frustrated and very rewarding.Jordanchallenge:Amazing Graphics: id give a nine out of ten but still top notch Controls:nine and a half out of ten. The contros were really easy to adapt to as this was my first 2k game.Sound:Very realistic and you can even listen to the games soundtracks(they are pretty good) during the game.Replayability:I think ill keep coming back to this game for a long time...... This is honestly the worst NBA 2K game ever made. The whole reason for a video game is to be able to score. You cannot drive at all. Players dont finish. You cant get buy your defender. In all other NBA games it was much easier to score. The worst thing about this game is you turn the ball over all the time. It is ridiculous. And its IMPOSSIBLE to shoot 3s. I looked at the highest 3 point percentage online and it was 33 percent. Mine is around 12 percent. In 2K10 my 3 point percentage was 40 something. They tried to make the game so realistic that it is awful. I do not recommend it at all. This game should continure to get horrible reviews because this is a horrible game. I have played every NBA 2K game and this is buy far the worst one.. I have this game and its good but it is very similar to NBA 2k10 and i am disappointed they did not change the dunking controls. Also it lacks player skills like even Michael Jordan he is not that amazing in this game also with Kobe Bryant one of the best basketball players right now and he is lacking skill. Next theres people that are overrated like Steve Blake he knocks down almost every three pointer no problem. But overall its a pretty decent game.. In the last jordan challenge against utah, i can score 60, 10 assists, win by 20 against the jazz and lose the challenge for having only 3 steals and thats frustrating. rest of the game is great. 2K11 is an incredibly deep basketball sim. It's also the only noteworthy basketball sim this year since EA chose to cancel their Live/Elite entry for 2010. But, don't let that give you the idea that you'd merely be settling. 2K11 boasts a complex control scheme which grants the gamer unparalleled control of his/her favorite team. Add to that the inclusion of the the much publicized Jordan Challenge mode and this is one of the greatest sports games ever released.. Iam totally pleased with this game!! Not only is this the only basketball game EVER!! To have MJ its the best basketball game ever made. From the controls to the graphics to the gameplay perfect!!. Such a disappointment. They tried to make this game too realistic. Controls are awkward. Lacks the simple finesse of the 2k8-10. I couldn't care less about playing as Michael Jordan or the 96 bulls. Players do some awful mix of what you tell them to do and what the game wants them to do. Play calling is the only way to score on the impenetrable defense, which takes forever and you sit at the top of the key and wait for players to shift and hope you don't get a back court violation when you try to turn on a dime and the computer wants to go left like its a nascar track. I only played this game for about three hours before putting 2K10 in and feeling better about over the top basketball.. I rarely if ever buy a sports game, but as a Bulls fan how could I resist the first game to give us a real Michael Jordan. And I was not disapointed. The Jordan Mode alone is worth the price of admission. Getting to match the 96 Bulls against the LeBron lead Heat will forever answer your questions as to the best team ever. This is a must buy for Bulls fans, a must buy for basketball fans, and one of the funnest games I've played all year.. As a kid growing up and idolizing Michael Jordan, I always pretended I was him playing basketball. I had the jersey, the shoes, and even drank Gatorade after I was done playing hoops. When basketball video games would come out I missed the fact the Jordan was not in the game. If you were like me, you would go to the â. I am what you may call a 2k fan boy getting pissed off at those who claim live/elite to be better. In saying that this years game is little short of brilliant, I had high expectations and almost everyone of them was surpassed. The gameplay is so tight and realistic I found myself enjoying watch the computer play itself. There is much more control with isomotion and the players run in game plays with a real sense of urgency. Watch Mike Miller run through multiple screens to get an open look is sensational. The game is not perfect however as there is the occasional choppy animation and the classic teams while great for the starting line ups are largely made up of 50-58 overall made up bench players who play for several teams. The MJ features are a lot of fun and tearing John Starks up for 55 is a fond memory of mine. Its not perfect but the best basketball simulator of all time and will give you hours and hours of realistic fun.. After remarkable releases over the years that changed the dynamic of simulation in basketball video gaming, NBA 2k11 delivers a highly enticing treat of basketball to fans who feel as it is there duty to engage in one of the most anticipated releases of this decade. However, aside from the fantastic gameplay and realistic style of play modeled by the NBA of today and the past, I can't help but to wonder if the Michael Jordan attraction caused this game to become superior than it really is. Don't get me wrong, of course. This game is sensational, from the innovative style of gameplay dynamics, to the presentation. This is a flawless franchise and it has improved considerably from the previous year, but beware. This game is about michael jordan, not about the NBA as much as we don't like to admit such a claim, so please keep that in mind when delving into the title.. Awesome game.From the presentation, to the player models to the core gameplay, it's just terrific.Brilliant simulation of the game of basketball, loved the hp half tome report.10 on 10.. IMO, this is a heavily polished version of 2k10, with the addition of His Airness. It's still a good game, but not that much has changed and there aren't a terrible number of new ""features"", apart from the few MJ sponsored scenarios. It seems most of what MJ touches, he makes better. 2K11 is no exception. The MJ sponsorship is definitely tugging on the heart strings of gamers and bball fans everywhere. However, if you peel that away, it's a bit of deja vu, unfortunately.. By far this is the truest adaptation of the NBA by any and every standard. From small intricacies of the new crossover system. To the new and improved physics and shooting techniques. This game will absolutely blow you away whether you are a fan of the sport/NBA 2K series or not. Graphically the game is a cut above anything we've seen in a sports game to date. This is how I came to my score of a Perfect 10 rating: Graphics: 9.5 (Best looking sports game out right now, can't quite give it a 10 here though.) Sound: 10 (Commentary is INSANELY accurate. They speak about events outside of the game as well.) Gameplay: 10 (New controls, New features, Awesome All-Around.) Replayability: 10 (This is a 10 for me because I'm a huge basketball fan, This may not be the same for everyone, but for a fanatic like me it is definitely worth it. With the new Jordan Challenges, My Player Mode, Jordan: Creating A Legend Mode, Online Team, Crew, and Exhibition games, it has a wealth of options for any gamers style. Overall: 10 BEST SPORTS GAME EVER!!!","2K11 is hands down the best basketball game ever made . animations are awful and gameplay doesn't hold up . ""My Player"" mode where you must play all 82 games, which takes too much time ."
495.Disco Elysium: The Final Cut,"Not a good game, perhaps a decent book but the gameplay just isn't there. This more like a visual novel, not my cup of tea.. It is one of that games that makes you interiorize yourself and think about how you act. I really enjoyed it and i believe everyone should give it a rey.. Disco Elysium is more than a game Disco Elysium is a unique detective game where you live the life of an amnesiac alcoholic, investigate a murder and make moral choices that determine everything. The game is like a book, where every day is a new chapter, and the characters come to life thanks to their vivid characters and unforgettable dialogues. The world is filled with details: from key items and weapons to the little things that affect the development of the plot. You are given complete freedom to be whoever you want to be, make decisions and build your character. This game is suitable for those who want to feel the atmosphere of a real detective, dive into a deep story and feel responsibility for every choice.. I can't really say I was thrilled throughout my entire playthrough of this game and too often skipped through dialogue when I wasn't really engaged in certain conversations. But I can't really give this anything other than a 10/10. For me I had to be in the mood to play this game since I tried it once but dropped it because lack of 'gameplay', but after the second time around I'm a full convert to the school of Kitsuragi, and will definitely play it again in the future to see what other paths I can take. It's unlike anything I've ever played. Probably has the best written dialogue in a video game ever.. I played some have to finish to give full review sdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdsdds. If you are an RPG lover, wait, scrap that. If you are a nCRPG lover and you didn't know of this game you must play it, if you are already playing it stop reading this and continue doing so. However, if you knew about the game and you are not playing it, I would not want to know how the rest of your life choices are... I never wanted to disco more in my life: 10/10. In general the game is AWESEOME and I would have loved to give a 9-10 here. But unfortunately I faced repeatedly some save game bugs on PS5 causing me to lose a total of 4-5 on game progress. Since could not research about how, when and if theses issues occure again I stopped the game after 26h without finishing... @ZA/UM: I know you are small and have little ressources. But this bug KILLS your game. I just hope you manage to do better in future. All the best nevertheless!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For me, Disco Elysium is an unique experience, showing me how to make a great interactive game with a compelling cast of characters and a truly beautiful and believable world. The writing has many moments that I would consider masterpieces and barely any flaws. My recommendation is to go play this game as blind as you can and without a guide. Any spoiler will ruin the experience. 10/10.. Some of the sharpest and most insightful writing in the medium. The dice-roll system makes for a unforgettable and unpredictable experience where no playthrough is the same. Set in a world that feels familiar and alien at the same time. Doesn't provide easy answers. A beautiful affirmation of humanity in the face of a corrupt and decaying society. Memorable characters.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ""Choose one of the fascist or communist things to say, or **** off."" Best line in any game ever.. One of the best and most unusual games I've ever played. It combines an original story and plot with depth and uniqueness in gameplay. The game explores interesting themes, offering a one-of-a-kind visual style that makes it truly stand out. An unforgettable experience that stays with you long after you’ve finished playing.. A game where you talk to the same NPC for 20 minutes and eventually forget what you are talking about. I'm talking to the woman, I forget why I'm talking, I forget what I'm talking about, you've written so much text, but couldn't you find a more entertaining way than left-clicking the player for minutes on the screen? Recommended for those who have a good memory and really want to deep dive into the story.Translated with **** (free version). One of the best games I have ever played, and I have played a bunch. Even so it is so much different to any other game gameplay wise. For everyone that loves deep story and detective narative binded with some mind games, I very much suggest trying it!. I would have really liked to give this game a higher rating for its unique narrative structure and ideas. Ideas that have already been talked about in depth, like fracturing the inner voice of the character in a modernist style for instance. So, surely this game has earned itself a place in the video game canon. But there is one aspect of this artwork that seemingly is of no concern to the wider public, which is why I would like to talk about the world this story is set in. I really believe that the entire narrative suffers immensely from being set in a fictional world. A world that is torn between trying to evoke the semiological and cultural complexities of reality while also attempting to estrange the fiction from this cultural reality. The result is that the player finds himself in a fake baltic city of the fake former Russian Empire where people speak fake French. This becomes even weirder when we learn about the fake Germans in Gottwald, the fake Dutch from Oranje or the fake Japanese from Seminine. This game uses a lot of academic terminology and in my opinion it is okay that there are also works of art with complicated language that isn‘t for everyone, but when you start to filter academic language with all its complex cultural and semantic connotations through this fictional lense it just becomes confusing and frankly a bit silly. When Marx becomes Masov and Marxism becomes Masovianism reading the texts becomes quite annyoing because you always have to translate the fictionalised versions of common concepts back into their original form. If they had set the game in an alternate history scenario where the Russian Revolution failed they could have just used all of the concepts they are so clearly referring to directly. Now one might argue that this estranged reality was somehow necessary to convey the amnesia of the protagonist to the player, but I would argue that if this was the case they made the world to similar to our own. It is a strange amnesia where the protagonist remembers what socialism, or social democracy is, but needs an explainer on fake Marxism i.e. Mazovianism. The amnesia story is just a necessary plot device to communicate all the concepts that have been altered in this fiction. In short the fictional world wants to profit from the infinite cultural and linguistic complexity of our world without actually setting the game in the real world. You can clearly observe that in the name Elysium. It is a Latin term that was infused with a lot of nuance and meaning over the course of human history and is specific to our world with our history. The fact that they named the fictional world in such a fashion is ignoring the complex etymology process of this term and therefore it seems completely out of place as a name for a world where this etymological history does not exist. In a normal sci-fi or fantasy setting that doesn‘t take itself too seriously all of what I mentioned wouldn’t really matter, but when the story takes itself seriously to the point of using academic terminology it should refrain from distorting the true semantic origins of the concepts it is dealing with.. meh, overrated Reddit TM game, just your regular modern day slop, nothing innovative and boring gameplay... One of the best RPGs of all time. Choice matteres, fantastic writing and ambiance, unique setting... memorable.. an unrepeated rpg experience with excellent writing. Will never forget how the story ends, wrapping up in the highest synthesis possible. Just the best finale i ever experienced in a videogame. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Peak, peak gameplay, peak story, peak soundtrack. 10/10 best 2019 game by far.. Its a near perfect RPG/adventure game. It's funny, beautiful - at times incredibly touching. It takes place in a decayed worls and your character is a slob, yet it left me feeling hopeful. The depth of the RPG mechanics are the best I ever tried, and just going with what happens without reloading the game on failed rolls, made for some incredibly satisfying moments. It definitely takes some investment, and I can imagen its not for everyone. But it's the best game I've played for the last two decades.. I'm not at a level to understand the quality of this game, maybe I'll try it again later.. Disco Elysium 9/10 It’s Called Disco Funky Baby Disco Elysium is one hell of a ride, and a LONG ride. You are constantly walking back and forth between locations and going through dialogue, you’ll be holding the sprint button a lot to circumvent the travel time, picking up items that you are unsure hold any value to the main quest or side quest, but the game holds you with a death grip! The dialogue is fantastic, and people doing this voice work are doing their job phenomenally. As mentioned before there is a lot of talking going on in this game but damn if you don’t want to listen to every word of it, every character is carefully crafted, and when you run into a new NPC you will be excited to see their character art and hear their voice. I can tell there was an abundant amount of time and energy that went into developing every person you can interact with and I really appreciate that, and these NPCs have so many side quests! It felt like anytime you were talking to someone you were bound to get some sort of “pointless” side quest and not necessarily did you receive these quests from the NPC you were talking to but from the mind of the MC, which brings me to the gameplay. The game has a unique way of presenting the skills in which you interact with the world. They are voices in the MCs head but are all of different aspects of the characters mind and inner dialogue with himself I.E: Logic, Authority, Physical Instrument, and Composure. These are just 4 of the 24 skills all pulled one each from the 4 attributes categories of: Intellect, Psyche. Physique, and Motorics; it is through these skills and attributes that you play the game and depending on their point values they will be added to a 2d6 roll when the appropriate skill comes into play but that’s just how the game operates, what is more interesting is what these skills have to say to our MC.They talk to each other and the MC in his head whilst in conversation with the NPCs and sometimes after clicking certain thought bubbles in the game. I loved hearing Authority get fed up with teenage delinquents, or Composure trying to make the MC keep his cool while he questions someone. What might be even more fun is getting to know the world of Disco Elysium. The MC is recovering from one hell of a hangover as the game opens but it's not just a headache that has him, it's also a serious case of amnesia. He is essentially a blank slate, and similar to the player he is essentially a newcomer to the game's fictional world. The game has alot to tell about the world that you find yourself in. By feeding you trivia having to do with the geography, culture, politics, ect you get to learn a lot and really gets you invested in the world. The worldbuilding in Disco Elysium is well crafted and thought out to say the least and for people that like that sort of thing you will definitely enjoy the 30 hours the game has to offer, anytime I played there wasn’t a time I wasn't learning something about the world and its inhabitants. Also by the time you start entering the final hours of the game It feels like no side quest you did or person you talked to was meaningless. I have to say Disco Elysium was a fun and unique experience, while I wasn’t 100% satisfied with the ending, I must say I still enjoyed every moment, and character I encountered on my personal playthrough. Not immediately but maybe in a year or 2 i’ll try another playthrough. This game was amazing, an easy 9/10. What else can I say, Disco never dies brother-man. TL;DR 9/10AMAZING VOICE WORK AND DIALOGUE, FUN INTERESTING WORLD, UNIQUE GAMEPLAY AND USE OF SKILLS. Amazing RPG with an elaborate, fantastic narrative, plenty of ramifications, beautiful graphics and sounds. A must play for story-driven RPG fans!. This game just perfect all of the lore and choices drag you into the gameevery single choice drag you somewhere else just play it.. An awesome game. It is like reading a thriller book while deciding how to procced with history.A must play.. This game made me laugh. It made me think. It made me sad. A true work of art.. At first glance you can say that this is a game not for everyone. Nonetheless, with me it was not the case and I managed to pass the first 3-4 hours and it got really good. The more you explore the city and people who live in it, the more you get interested. Every character is well written and has a background story to share. The main plot is also intriguing till the very end and can surprise even after. The only thing that bothered me is a map, which exists but it is barely any useful.. It's a peculiar game for people with certain taste it's not for everyone - not in a snobby way but more esthetic and gameplay wise - it's a dialoge narrative based game with little more than reading and listening to npcs. You get an illusion of being able to make a change in the world but in the end it's just the same result with differt paths to it - it has a low replayability ratio since you won't see anything new trying a new approach or different dialogue options. Overall a good story with a boring gameplay.. This game is something else. It's sadly ironic that we will not see sequel any time soon or most likely never will given the unfortunate dissolution of core designers. That being said this game is timeless masterpiece that anyone into video games should at least try out. Writing is on another level really and even though I don't usually play ""reading"" games this one did grab me right from the start and hooked me all the way to the end. It is a game you will think about long time after playing.. Cannot recommend enough. This game--quite literally--gave me vertigo in real life.. Disco Elysium – an unprecedented game from an incredible team with a sad story. Somehow, the dramatic and depressive mood of the world of Revachol has spread to the ZA/UM studios. Despite the fact that Disco Elysium is one of the highest-rated games in the entire history of games, ZA/UM went through such a series of scandals, problems, and dismissals of key employees that we can’t even hope for a continuation of the game anytime soon.Visual 10/10There are no vivid visual effects, but the style and art are very deep and interesting. Many companies try to earn marketing points by not using AI instead of real artists’ concepts. However, usually, these human-made arts are dull. Disco Elysium’s art is the rare case where artists have really done great work. The genre is poorly visualized but still, the environment conveys the depressive and melancholic mood of the world; the portraits of the characters are made in different styles and highlight their personal traits. My favorite art in the game are the pictures of the skills. They are absolutely amazing, and I've seen many people on various parts of the internet use these images as avatars, including myself. Narrative 10/10The plot is not overloaded with delusional elements like parallel universes, but there are still plenty of crazy and interesting things at the junction of reality and madness, which give you space to interpret and guess what is happening. The basic story is solid and interesting, developing alongside the game as are the character arcs. One of the best indicators of the high caliber of the game's characters is the fact that there are plenty of groups on Telegram, Facebook, and other social networks where people create and share memes and fan fiction about the game's characters. But the main gem of the game is a bunch of philosophical, social, political, and historical questions, which the authors explore through dialogues between the player and the characters. In some ways, this is not only a game but also a socio-political and philosophical treatise and discussion at the same time. And precisely this aspect makes the game so amazing and unique. Gameplay 10/10I’ve seen plenty of discussions about the gameplay in Disco Elysium: some people assume there is hardly any gameplay at all, and it’s more an interactive book than a game. But look – it’s not just a big text that you read. Instead, the entire dialogue tree depends on your character traits and personality. I’ve played twice, and each time I created completely different characters, resulting in all the dialogues being different. This is a main feature of the game: the role-playing aspect is truly inimitable here. You can find something like this in very old-school RPGs like Fallout 1 and 2, but there are very few such games, literally a few. And Disco Elysium is probably the best among them. Sound 10/10It might seem odd, but yes, even the sound is magnificent and flawless here. Musical tracks from the game have become legendary, and you'll understand why if you have played. The voice actors have done truly amazing work; I haven't seen better voice acting anywhere else. I’ve heard that the development team did not plan to voice all the dialogues in the game since the whole game consists of them and there are tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of text. But in the end, they voiced 100% of the text in the game, and I am sure that the voice acting has become one of the ingredients of the wonderful cocktail that is Disco Elysium. Overall 10/10I hope I have explained why you should try this game if you enjoy role-playing gameplay, an interesting plot, distinctive arts, and good music. I am really happy for you if you have not played this game yet. But I am also happy for myself and everyone else who has played it, because, first of all, we gained an amazing game experience over dozens of hours and, secondly, we still have the opportunity to return to the game, create a new style of character, and play the game from almost scratch. And I am also happy for humanity because ZA/UM created this miracle for us.. Story and characters are deep. Visuals are cool and refreshingly different. But you have to run through the map back and forth just too much in this game and it’s cumbersome often when you have to run around little bushes because there is no way. Also the mechanic to try white challenges again doesn’t work out. This was supposed to be one of THE game mechanics which many players ended up solving with saving and reloading to retry.. Disco Elysium is a complex story about post-war aftermath, politics, existential crises, the choices you make, and how they shape the world around you, all with just one D20 dice.. It's simple, I'm too dumb for this game. It's looks amazing, it's interesting and I enjoyed what I did play for the most part but my brain had had enough after a few hours. At first I thought the game was crap. But it was just a high barrier to entry for me. As a result, I deleted it. Thank God I decided to return to it again and saw that this is a real game, with a great narrative! I can’t remember a more interesting plot since The Witcher.. Honestly one of the best story games I've ever played. Packed full of interactions and side-objectives.. that was incredible. I was playing this kind of game first time and it was an excellent experience.. Disco Elysium is a masterpiece in the RPG genre. Set in the captivating world of Revachol, it offers a deep narrative and a unique character development system. The game's outstanding atmosphere, brilliant writing, and philosophical undertones make it truly unforgettable. While it has minor flaws, such as occasional unintuitive interactions, they are overshadowed by its immense value.. we wont see a game like this again for many years. ZA/UM, being the true creatives they are, went out in the most rockstar way possible. Rest in peace comrades. I haven't played this game at all. I've adjusted the rating to reflect its current average rating, since it's not possible to delete my initial entry. Apologies for any inconvenience.. This game stands out for its excellent writing. It's philosophical, emotional, and oftentimes very funny. It reminds me of Obsidian entertainment in its prime. It is very rare that I replay a game, but I played through Disco Elysium 3 times to get all the trophies, and although the major story beats are mostly the same, I was delightfully surprised in each playthrough just by using alternative builds and choosing different dialog options. On the downside it doesn't quite stick the landing, and the dialog sometimes get tediously political. I didn't like the cryptid stuff. 89 hours to platinum.. It not a game, but its not a VN too, its neither a movie, nor a boardgame - its an experience. I am in awe and the ride reminded me when I first played through Deus Ex 20odd years ago. Absolute disco, baby !. Gave this game two tries. Found it extremely slow and boring. I don’t think Im the dice rolling type.. Really want to like it. Have only heard great things about it from everyone else whos played it. I just cannot get through the first 8-ish hours without feeling completely lost or bored out of my mind. Almost assuredly my own fault, but since I'm 'me' I can't in good faith rate it well.. Pretty good story and conclusion. Ending is satisfying. But there are some (in my opinion) loose ends for the side tasks, which gives a sense of ""incompleteness"". Die mechanics is not as well implemented as BG3, and the given probabilities are not correct. Their RNG is probably not sampling from a uniform distribution. There are some unskippable animations, which is never a good idea. But overall, it is an enjoyable and easy-to-get-hooked game and definitely should be played if you like these kind of games.. Cool concept, but drags its feet later on and lacks polish. The game development self-reflections are amazing. Moreso after what happened to Disco Elysium's creators.. The port is full of lags and bugs that spoil all other components of this game.. I had very various feelings while playing this game: sometimes it became too boring with all those tons of text and all the political stuff and sometimes it was very interesting to know what would happen next. This game is really one of the best RPG I've played for many years. Not that RPG with magic, orcs and etc., but the RPG where you can realy play the character you want to be with the setting and the decorations the developers offering to us. So we here have the really good game, but because of too much boring political things in dialogues (which often are too bloated) and because of the weak finale I can only give seven.. Game broke at Day 2, ran out of money and no way to return if you removed all earlier saves. One ofthe deepestn interest storiesi ever saw, gameplay r funny af n has a really cool final.. This is one of my favourite games of all time. Even though ZA/UM's situation is still really bad, i have to admit that the Final Cut Edition brought so much to it. The voice acting is nothing but perfect. The art direction by Aleksander Rostov is impecable. I can't find anything in this game that i don't love. Absolute masterpiece. 10/10.. Disco Elysium was pretty cool. I enjoyed the narrative and characters. The game mechanics were okay, but I didn't enjoy the pacing.. I must say, even after hours of playing I don't like main character that much, would much rather have some basic character creation or something like that. But I understand why they make him like that and it is much better to do something like that rather than making bad tabula rasa guy. Endings were also meh, but overall game is really amazing.. I do not know why I waited so long to play this game. If you are a fan of RPGs, you will likely love it. The depth of choice in dialogue is astonishing. The world that the developers have created as the backdrop for the story is so incredibly deep and well thought out. Every time I go to play it I feel like I am finding out the games secrets. It is an absolute masterpiece.. This game is a masterpiece. Everything is voice acted, which makes it a lot of easier to get **** into the story.. This game is a masterpiece. Everything is voice acted, which makes it a lot of easier to get **** into the story.. This indie game is a true masterpiece. You can experience a wide range of emotions. I recommend everyone on this planet to try this game.. Introduction: This indie game has received a lot of praise. after playing through Disco Elysium, I see where these reviews come from. I think the reviews are slightly inflated, but overall I agree it is a nice, innovative, beautiful game. The good: The art is phenomenal, i love the brush stroke style that is so prevalent. I love the use of colours. I loved the voice acting. Some of the best i've heard in any video game period. Memorable, talented performances. lastly, i cant deny the amount of effort and love that has been put into the lore and writing and amount of things you can interact with. I liked the attribute and skills system, and how it affected your character. I also liked the clothing system and how it linked with that aforementioned system. you spend so much time in Revachol, and so much time learning about it that you grow to love it. Another advantage of spending so much time in one neighbourhood is that the player starts to feel like the place and its inhabitants are real. I certainly won't forget about Martinaise, which is located in Jamrock, a disctrict of Revachol, a city of the Insulinde Isola. What could have been improved: It is a detective game, but I didn't feel like the game pushes you to use your deductive skills or memory much. Furthermore, as the game opens up, you really start to feel that Harry and Kim are slow. There is a lot of retracing. It becomes more and more tedious as the game goes on and you have an increasing amount of ground to cover. Perhaps fast travel or the ability to sprint could have remedied this. My next complaint may be a little unpopular, but -didnt know what was real, based on real-life, or completley fictional + i feel like other loations would have been even more fun, say sci-fi or different time period like roman or wild west + I also personally would have wished for a shorter game. 30 hours + of just dialogue and smashing through doors is exhausting. perhaps i should have played the game with more pauses... but it feels like there is simply tooooo much information, it almost gave me a headache, and it certainly made me increasingly want to skip dialogue as I approached the 2nd half of the game. I really liked this quote from a redditor: ""The dialogue (...) is the game's main bread and butter. Except here the bread and butter is a five course meal of extremely over buttered, heavily salted and garnished bread."" To conclude: A nice, deep, educational game for adults. It's basically about an old, alcoholic, amnesiac detective solving a murder mystery while uncovering what happened before his memory loss. You don't actually do much but the characters and gameplay mechanics carry the game. There aren't many highlights, apart from the karaoke and the church dance, and perhaps the tribunal scene. I give the game 75/100.. A great and deeply strange game with a focus on narrative and progression leading the outcomes and overall success. Won't satisfy all folks who aren't into slow point and click-style RPG, but the great story and memorable experience make well worth a playthrough.. I normally am not a huge family of games like this that have such a large amount of dialogue, however I was very enthralled by the world and choices you make. The mystery and freedom of exploration and discoveries was a joy. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a very unique game that rewards you for your play style.. Just really fun writing, humor, characters and a decent story. Highly reccomended.. The fact that all the console reviewers give this game a 9 instead of a 10 confirms that console peasantry is a real thing. Join the pc master race, play this game, and be enlightened. This game is perfection and absolutely deserves more than an 8.9. Anytime someone asks for a game recommendation there is one game I'll always recommend 100% of the time.. Disco Elysium.. Funny, witty and full of attitude. This game is something never seen in the indutry before.. interior monologue and stream of consciousness. great detective, nice details. it's like a good book. gameplay little boring but still must play.. boring. One of the best crafted narrative experiences of this generation.. Enjoy your time with mindscating. Best ever detective game(great plot too). Universal acclaim seems appropriate AF in The Final Cut.. I have no idea why this game is so popular. The dialogue/narration is full of pretentious garbage, and the gameplay is extraordinarily slow and boring. Disco Elysium is a snoozefest, plain and simple.. The ****. Any negative review here, mentioning the bugs..well they've been fixed with weeks of the games release. Besides the bugs that were fixed almost immediately, I'm not sure what else you could deduct points for.. One of, if not the best role playing game to date. Disco elysium took a different approach on the genre and beautifully executed it. Lots of replay ability and its excellent World building leaves plenty to explore and delve into.. Disco Elysium is a decent point and click adventure. Awesome art and world building. The plot is interesting enough to carry you until the end. The game narrative is basically a ""choose your own adventure"" story with simple tabletop RPG mechanics, so you will basically read a lot of text and answer questions. PS5 controls feel really clunky. Had one freeze along my playthrough.. It is beyond rare to find a game of such singular vision and artistic weight to it, certainly one as well-fleshed-out as Disco Elysium. All video games have artistic elements, and varying degrees of artistic value. But DE feels like it’s primarily a work of art, in a way that no other game has to me. That does not make it better than other great games, but it does make it special. Something like DE could not have come from the gaming industry. DE is artists making a game; we are much more used to seeing game designers make art. It won’t be to everyone’s taste, but for those who may enjoy it, it’s an essential experience. I very strongly recommend playing it blind, without save scumming—you are supposed to fail things in the game. Play how you like, but you only get one opportunity for that kind of playthrough. It’s beautiful, it’s ugly, it’s laugh-out-loud funny, it’s sad. The writing is better than any I’ve experienced in a game before, which is good, because the writing is 75% of the game. The skill system is awesome. These characters are instant classics, Kim (your partner) in particular. As for the player character… I don’t think I’ve ever cared as much about a player character in a game. The player is given a lot of control in how to define him, but his problems are his own. I have never felt more invested in the well-being and journey of a player character.. This game make me think and touch my heart which I cannot say about manygames. It was a truly interesting and dropping journey that I would recommend to anyone who can take the tak system and reading and listening to Long dialogue. I like the main character in Kim's I'm play as a guy who tried to he","disco elysium is a unique detective game where you live the life of an amnesiac alcoholic . you investigate a murder and make moral choices that determine everything . the game is like a book, where every day is a new chapter ."
496.Horizon Zero Dawn,"Amazing story, graphics, controls, music and atmosphere. Very good game showing what the PS4 can do best. Love this game it was one of my favorites from the ps4 era. I think the world and the story are amazing.. Horizon Zero Dawn is a painfully generic open-world game hiding behind flashy visuals. The tired Ubisoft-style mechanics—like climbing towers to unlock maps—make exploration a chore, not a joy. Worse, main quests are locked behind level requirements, forcing you to slog through uninspired side quests that feel like filler.Sure, it looks great, but graphics can’t save a game that prioritizes grinding over fun. It’s a shallow, frustrating experience that drags far more than it entertains.. The premise for Horizon Zero Dawn is intriguing and combat is generally fun, but the game doesn't manage to hold attention. The world itself is poorly developed, lacks personality and never feels alive. You can never interact with, for example, the inside of houses. The main character is able to perform amazing jumps but only when she is allowed to by the developers - you are not free to go where you want and find your own way. Forgettable characters send you on forgettable fetch quests. Game environments, especially in the mainline story, are similar and padded with video. After a while, I just wanted to get through the story and have it end. While it is worth picking up to fight robo dinos for a few hours, there is no way this sits at the top of the open world genre.. Great story, great future advisory, and great game mechanics, was so deep and fun! is a big map game.. While the gameplay is absolutely fantastic, the confusing story never catched me.. Its too good, trust me and play this, its so good, your experience will be bewildering.. What can I say, HZD has opened up an unprecedented new world that had me hooked from the first minute. Anyone who hasn't played it yet and appreciates a gripping, complex story must do so. On top of that, Aloy is probably the best female protagonist of all time. Thank you Guerilla Games!. The combat is fun. The story is ok. Good graphics. The open world is nice to look at, but unfortunately totally boring to explore. The longer I played the game, the more I had to force myself to keep playing it. It's not a bad game, but not particularly good either. Quite overrated.. One of the best gameplay mechanics ever, decent story, and technically beatiful. Truly a masterpiece. Never thought a game story could appeal to me at such high emotional note, it is very engaging from start to finish. The mechanics and gameplay are also awesome. Some side quests are good, most are average but action packed. Rooting for Aloy. This game is wonderful, it's the monalisa of games. Fantastic! it's unlikely that we'll ever have a game as good as this one when it comes out!. When the game came out i was completely amazed by the ambient Guerrilla decided to space the game: a post-apocaliptic scenario dominated by machines that only wait to slap your cheecks, and then there's you, out there, sent by people who excluded you from your tribe all your life, trying to survive a 20 meter armoured colossus called thunderjaw :). Wow. The entire horizon franchise just blows me away! I fell In love with zero dawn and the Frozen wilds, and forbidden west and the burning shores are on the exact same level of perfectness! I literally can’t describe how much this world means to me, and it will forever stay in my heart!️. Impactful story; engaging though sometimes frustrating open world; decent combat; emotional depth. this game is so absolutely incredible, and absolute masterpiece was delivered and served to the table by Guerilla, 10/10 story gameplay combat graphics, I don't have too many words, 10/10 no more but an absolute masterpiece. just another boring open world game with pointless and too much side mission. Horizon is a unique open-world, story driven game on it’s own right. But with the UX issues and some “Ubisoft” like features, it doesn’t stand up when compared to other games on this genre. However, the plot and combat mechanics makes up for all of it overall, making it a solid game and a good game to recommend.. The story behind the game was immersive, pulled me right in. It gives a new meaning to the lore you discover in the old recordings. The mechanics of the game are nice, although it's never my main reason for playing. I wanted to know what happened, and I enjoyed the characters a lot. Beautiful music too.. It's a beautiful masterpiece, really. The story and the character and lore. First time I went to consume the tie in comics of a video game franchise. From the soundtrack to the story everything about this game is just perfect.. Awesome game, better than Assassin's Creed, Witcher 3 and Tomb Raider combined.. A truly masterpiece, with a phenomenal storyline and lore! Some side activities could be more creative, but the main side missions are very good. The soundtrack is absolutely perfect, and the visuals are charming, bringing a very original vibe. Fantastic game!. The core combat and stealth mechanics against the Machines in this game are phenomenal. The stealth mechanics against Humans is serviceable, but not great. The melee combat against humans is terrible, and I think the game's biggest weakness. Another weakness is the soundtrack, its fine but forgettable, in no way does it elevate the Story, which is excellent, and excellently told. The Weapons & Armor Modification system is simple enough to figure out, and while its not super deep, it works well and is fun to tinker with. The real depth of the gameplay is centered on the Weaknesses of the Machines to different weapons and ammo. The world is fun to explore; the game is beautiful; side quests are engaging enough, but importantly don't waste your time. Ultimately, a handful of annoying nitpicks keeps this game from being sublime; human melee combat; some of the voice acting; mediocre soundtrack; some of the writing. But overall, this is a great game.. I liked the concept and the open world of this game. The story is interesting, and the graphics are awesome.. Stunning gorgeous visuals, great storyline, memorable characters, best music ever. Almost a perfect game where the only negative is a dialogue that sometimes makes the main character seem insufferable.. Amazing gameplay features but a lot of glitches, problematic hitboxes. The setting was also great, the story was ok but the characters were boring.. While i actually really liked its sequel, this game was pretty lackluster. Its a finished ubisoft game. The world can be pretty, depending on the angle, but i say it could be a lot better both in traversal aspect and visual aspect. Combat was pretty boring and repetitive, there isnt too much to choose from, lacks feedback but it is serviceable, it can be enjoyed but it isnt lasting. Story was the only thing it made me stay, around the 50% mark sylens showed up and he was, actually a lot of fun. It did not interrup pace and dialogue was incredibly enjoyable. it had a good ending and it was interesting, but only 50% onwards. Looking back it wasnt even that good but i really enjoyed it for some reason. I dont recomend buying it, try it to see if you like it but to me 50% is too much to get to an enjoyable part of 1 aspect.. One of the best Open Worlds ever made, beautiful and great Story! Also great Gameplay with big learning curve.. Incredible game!

The Cutscene of this game is stunning, as if you're watching a great movie.. I just started this title on PC, having previously delighted in my time playing its sequel on that platform. The switch went very smoothly. I'm not far enough into this one to be sure it measures up to the sequel in terms of character development and plot depth, but I wanted to set down an enthusiastic endorsement of the first big battle, a few hours in: it included a bunch of aggressive beasts followed by a challenging parcours race and a quick segue into two-part group melee. If you survive that, you get a surprise shocker that leaves you facing further struggles but at least with time to catch your breath. I found this battle challenging even on Easy difficulty and felt both exhausted and exhilarated at the end, definitely ready for a rest but can hardly wait to play some more. If you're a fan of classic RPGs, this game will satisfy your appetite for at least 50 hours. The heroine is sympathetic and admirable for her courage under fire as well as options to play a sympathetic character.. Boring and repetitive like Ubisoft open worlds with check-lists dumb missions plus enforced woke proselytism. Robots are nice. Missions, characters and story are garbage.. I love when Sony creates such exclusives from no where. It is going to be a classic. great visuals, perfect story and game play. you may get a little bored in the first 2 hours, yet the story will only go high as you keep playing and going deep into it. good job sony.. Thoughtful, original, and satisfying combat mechanics. Story telling, characters, and writing are just so very bad. Even the soundtrack is stupid.. What a brilliant idea to combine technology with a tribal setting. I must admit that it bored me for a long time, but once I got into it, I couldn't stop playing. Today, it's one of my favorite franchises. It strongly reminds me of the series The 100, even though the only commonality is the blend of technology with tribal culture.. Combat is to clunky. And I hate that the game makes you constantly run across the map.. I remember playing this at the launch of the PS5, I drowned in it. It will always have a special place in my heart.. Everything is perfect. One of the best, or probably the best open world to play on PS4. Original univer, story, characters, level design, weapons and gameplay mechanics, everything is mastered.. Atmosphere: 7 Enjoyment: 6 Gameplay: 7 Graphics: 8 Music: 5 Story: 5 Total: 6.33. Very good game. Great story and very likable main character. Story is captivating, makes you feel you can't wait to learn more.. HZD has a very intriguing combat system vs the robot machines with multiple ways to take down an enemy. The game is over before you can explore the depth of combat mechanics properly. the story is a stereotypical coming-of-age story with what feels like forced/arbitrary women empowerment tropes. If you see a woman, expect them to be strong independent. if it's a man, and you are wondering whether he is deeply flawed or evil, the answer is yes, unless he is deeply loyal to the main character. I played as part of PS Plus subscription but I wouldn't pay for this directly because it is partly a long lecture of exposition and forgets to be ""fun"" through many assigned tasks in the game. The graphics are very amazing in general but for me the story was missing something. The way you have battles wasn't able to catch me. I felt it very repetitive and missing playability.. It's a visually captivating open world with an engaging sci-fi backstory. In the early game, I enjoyed the feeling of freedom and vulnerability with the need to be cautious. I feel sorry for the tech team, as the game is let down by bad writing. The game induces an eye-rolling cringe as soon as anyone starts talking. The dialogue and character portrayal make Aloy feel like an aw-shucks, honest-to-goodness Disney Princess (TM) despite all her throat-slitting and headshots. It's not a competitor to Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2.. Combats not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. Great visuals and music, although the face animations can be a bit hit or miss. The real highlight of this game is the story, twists, slow reveals through the main and side quests, as well as through exploration of the map. If you play the game, whatever you do don't spoil the story for yourself!. this is one of the best new ips i have ever played the story telling world and enemies are amazing i really got captivated by the whole thing and found myself getting side tracked multiple times, the expansions also a good and challenging experience which is why i give it a 10. overrated and disappointing tbh, could have been much better... Play GOW instead. Zero Dawn is a fantastic overall game that reaches a higher level through a few amazing moments story wise. For most of the game you have an excellent open worlds adventure, great areas, cultures, towns, enemies and an amazing and fun snarky protagonist that feelsgreat to play in Aloy. The enemies of machienes are brilliant and pose great battles. As an engineer its so cool to see how real feeling they are and howclose alot of this game feels to a potential reality, both in physical locations,potential outcomes and ideas. /the combat feels good makes you feel on the hunt and in danger more an fun chaotic level with some need for more melee/ options. Combat is solid if a bit needing more in a sequel. The Story/ worldbuilding is great and you naturally get into the mystery through gameplay and enemy actions, great quest and characters. Once you get to the mystery reveal this game gave me goosebumps legit, the zero dawn project, systems, war and context being completely recontextualizing and frankly amazing. realizing the ethical implcations of this,what humans did, losing knowledge and how it explains everything is special just unbelievably amaing moment. Once that goes through you realize this games special story, great qualities and genuine triumph. Its tribes, reserch and genuine realistic feeling idea is just scary real its so good and just chilling. So much to love, its really special and the full package. Magnificent.. Didn't think I'd like it this much. Very good story. The world is breathtaking. It is repetitive after a while. Highly recommend!. It's a beautifull game to look at. Good gameplay, sadly besides Rost, the worst part are the characters, I just never cared about them.. The level of exploration in this game is amazing. So many challenges along the way, good dialogues, and interaction with the environment. Remember to collect the ""Power Cells"" the rest is a journey that you never forget. Super Game.. Best game I've ever played in my **** main heroine Aloy is the best fictional character to ever ****'s hard to put in words how good this game is and how much I love it,but all of its features like music,characters,the stroyline e.t.c. are outstanding and breathtaking.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Good story, great mechanics , the story is captivating and love the pacing of the story could be better, and side quest could be more personal and affect the world around you. I really want to like this game, but it's just so boring. NPC have no charakter and are easily forgettable, side quests are hidious and uninteresting to do and the open world is a burdain to navigate, so you fast travel. The strongest part of the game is the story, which is very interesting and well made. Ultimately it was the only reason that kept me playing the game.. Hands down the best game I’ve ever played. The story is intriguing, exhilarating, adventurous, heartfelt, and tragic. The twists are incredible and among the best I’ve witnessed across any media—books and screen productions included. I’m from the area it takes place in, and that was a mind-blowing experience. Strong character development, intricate storylines, enthralling side quests, and beautiful graphics. What’s not to love.. I Am playing this game and the DLC on my PS5, and it is so unbelievably great! Just everything, from the story, the world, the exploration, the characters, and so on are simply perfect! Everything feels so real, and I can really feel with the characters. There is no single thing, that is not great, so a 10 is the only reasonable rating for me. Just a Masterpiece!. great game not bad closest game to the witcher 3 in terms of gameplay but the player vs human combat mechanics are awful. Pros: The graphics are superb, the esthetics are beatiful, especially the landscapes. The only downside for me is no option to forward time since the game is much better looking in daytime. The story is interesting and engaging, great dialog and cutscene animations. Character design and voice acting is also great, I belived in the presented world and it's lore. Stripping machines of thier armour and bringing huge enemies down is quite satysfying. Collectibles are quite interesting and I felt motivated to look for them (you can buy a map that marks thier general location on your map which I find neat). Doing side quests is acknowledged in the main story line, which adds to the realism of the world. Cons: The game itself basically revolves around farming ingredients to create more ammo and add stat boosts to your weapons and armour, which in my opinion gets boring really quickly. Your inventory gets filled with these boosts and ingredients fast and you have to frequently sell them off to vendors. After a time you get to know all types of machines and fighting them feels like a chore and an uwatned obstacle to progress the story. The machines turn from an interesting concept of enemies into an irritating and boring filler pretty quickly. There are basically no other quests than killing machines and humans, there are no other mechanics than shooting 4 types of weapons and killing enemies that annoy you rather than beeing an interesting challenge. There is only one type of puzzle to open locked doors and it's really simple. There is an illusion of decision making - you can select 3 different responses sometimes in dialogue but it makes no difference to the story or the quests. The ending feels empty and underdelivers - it cuts quickly and leaves you in the world like after any other side quest.. While at first I didn't think I would be into laying traps and would just want to shoot guys, they really get you to buy into the combat mechanics and they all super satisfying to pull off. Great open world to explore with lots fun missions. Alloy is a great character and its fun to see how see handles different situations and evolve throughout the story.. Full Review on Metric Gamer. Horizon Zero Dawn's greatest strength lies in its gripping narrative (5/5). Aloy's quest for answers unfolds a rich tapestry of lore and intrigue. Every holographic recording discovered, every datapoint analyzed, adds another layer to the world's fascinating history. The story is masterfully paced, offering a satisfying mix of emotional moments, thrilling encounters, and heartwarming interactions. While the regressed tribes living alongside advanced technology create a sense of wonder, the complex lore can be overwhelming at times. However, the game rewards perseverance with a deeply satisfying conclusion that leaves a lasting impression. The world itself is a visual marvel (5/5). From the breathtaking expanse of sun-drenched plains to the lush jungles teeming with life, Horizon Zero Dawn's environments are a joy to explore. The intricate details on the mechanized creatures, from the lumbering Thunderjaws to the agile Raptors, truly bring them to life. Aloy's movements are fluid and responsive, making traversal through this diverse world a seamless experience. Combat in Horizon Zero Dawn is a strategic dance (3/5). Players have access to a diverse arsenal of weapons, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Bows of various types offer precision ranged attacks, while spears provide a powerful close-quarter option. The ropecaster adds another layer of strategy, allowing you to immobilize enemies for devastating follow-up attacks. A crucial aspect of combat lies in exploiting enemy weak points. Scanning a machine reveals its vulnerabilities, encouraging tactical approaches that go beyond simply unloading arrows. While the combat system is initially engaging, repetitive encounters with similar machines can lessen the thrill in the later stages of the game and there is no ability to lock on. While the main quests are compelling, side content can feel uneven (3/5). The vast world is filled with numerous side quests and errands, offering opportunities to earn valuable resources and learn more about the world's lore. However, some quests can feel repetitive, lacking the narrative depth found in the main story. Additionally, some quests are tucked away in obscure locations, making them easy to miss. Horizon Zero Dawn offers a decent amount of replay value (3/5). Different story choices can lead to slightly altered outcomes, and the skill tree allows for diverse character builds. However, the lack of significant branching paths or a New Game+ mode with additional challenges limits the incentive for a full replay. Ultimately, the game's charm lies in its captivating world and the mysteries it unveils. Once you've unraveled these secrets, there's less reason to revisit the world, although the rich lore and engaging combat can still provide enjoyment on a second playthrough. Overall, Horizon Zero Dawn is a fantastic journey for fans of action RPGs and captivating narratives. With its stunning visuals, gripping story, and strategic combat, it offers a truly immersive experience. While repetitive side quests and a lack of substantial endgame content might hold it back slightly, the game's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses.

[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game had potential to be great but something felt off and there were a ton of minor issues that kept it from being as good as it could have been. Good: gameplay and combat – specifically against the machines, the lore was very good, solid main story, beautiful graphics, smooth controls. Bad: side quest were generally boring, characters were mostly dull and unremarkable, dialogue was awkward at times and occasionally off-pitched making it difficult to hear, along with a number of other minor drawbacks. Overall though it was a very solid game. I also thought Frozen Wilds was a great DLC; I actually liked it better than the main game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. So poor game. Its a collage of mechanics without logic, the story thats good but it is so simple and it's not interesting. What a stunning game! Even in 2024, its visuals surpass most so-called next-gen titles. There’s no reason not to play it, even now. If it weren’t for the frustrating holographic storytelling choices, this would easily be a perfect 10.. An incredible adventure! A captivating, interesting story in beautiful technical execution!. I believe that THE ONLY REASON this is not rated as high as, say, Witcher 3, is because you play as a woman. But even if you're a man, you're nuts not to want to play as Aloy. You guys would get to control your dream girlfriend! And oh boy is she awesome! Anyway, in all seriousness, It’s my favorite game ever. I played it through twice, the second time on Ultra Hard, which was super fun. And then after that, I just lived in that world having fun. It’s accessible. You can play at your own pace. You can gain mastery over your relatively small number of weapons and movements and really feel like you’re a master. You can gain real skills, not just memorize a bunch of keystroke combinations. You can learn real timing and touch. You can learn about the robot animals behaviors, weaknesses, and abilities. It all works very logically. The main story is very cool, too. I spent like 300 hours in there until there was nothing left to do. I can't recommend it any higher, and I'm hard to please!. Very boring, very uninteresting, the game seemed to be made by a neural network, I didn't play anything more boring. One of the reasons why I sold the PS. Beautiful graphics, but gameplay is considerably repetitive. Story is average.. Almost perfect. Horizon Zero Dawn wraps a brilliantly crafted story in beautiful visuals and gameplay. My only criticisms being character dialogue/animations, and unmappable controls. If you enjoy open world RPG's you'll love Horizon, no doubt.. Best Game ever! The Grafics are so good, the Story and the Plots are fabulis and the gameplay is so fun! The Story is interesting and very good written and the fights are so much fun. Its such a good game! Worth to Play!. This game truly pushes the ps4 to it's limits along with it's frozen wilds dlc expansion. It is truly an open world original Opus.. Game is so normal childish gameplay and boring story i think 7 is more than enough. This Game is easily in my top 5 Videogames of all time. One of the best storys and one of the best main characters. Love this game <3. Horizon Zero Dawn is an incredible game, I platinumed the game about a week ago and I really enjoyed it, the story of the game is an incredible story and so is the protagonist, I didn't like one aspect of the game, after we get the suit: Shield-Weaver armor the game becomes quite easy and it ends up not being fun to kill the machines, I thought the platinum was good apart from the fact that I don't like collecting collectibles the collectibles in this game are quite interesting. Translated with **** (free version). Incredible story that enters a unique realm of science fiction. Combat is unique and fun. Some character writing, dialogue, and voice actin needs work.. Albert Einstein said: ""I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."" This game is about the after life of World War III and it is fascinating. People went back to the stone age, they fight with bows, arrows, and medieval weapons combined to shoot, more arrows. I love it. The world is full with modern machines with different types and with different weakness like fire and ice, shock, etc. You can scan them to see what their weakness is and fight them with fire bows, or throw at them ice bombs with a slingshot. There are horse and many more futuristic aggressive things. They have one thing to achieve: kill humans. The humans are trying to survive. The characters are awesome lovable, and You care for them. Such a good game. love it. 10/10. Not bad. Just not my type of game. Story is good but combat is bad, but world is amazing. Pros - beautifully realized world - fantastic creature design - immersive sound design - combat feels always fun, especially against larger machines - solid weapon and ammo variety allowing for multiple strategies against every type of enemy // Cons - forgettable characters - forgettable OST - lore is more interesting than the actual story // HZD is one of the few games I played on release that I kept thinking about for years. What I kept remembering was the fantastic combat, great creatures, beautiful vistas and just how crazy the reveals in the story were. Years later, I can happily say that it all stood the test of time. The game starts slow, introducing the various mechanics and then lets you run wild, doing anything on its massive map. The sheer scale of the world with the amount of detail is crazy to this day, especially since it looks so beautiful. Where the game excels is the robust enemy variety and the tools it gives you to deal with those enemies. Over ten weapon classes each with up to three ammo types allows you to tear, burn, freeze, shock, tie down and blow up everything in your path, in whatever style you prefer. Genuinely incredible. Where the game stumbles a bit is in its story and lore. Don't get me wrong, I think HZD has some of the most interesting lore I have ever dove into. It is also helped that this lore categorizes this game as the rare post-post apocalypse genre. The issue with it is the fact that the lore is way more interesting than the actual story on display. Aka, what happened before, is way more interesting than what is happening on screen. Overall, Horizon Zero Dawn was one of my most memorable games of the last generation and I am glad it was for a good reason.. One of the best Action Adventures I've played in recent years. The Open World feels realistic and alive, especially the fauna. The gameplay feels fresh and the story is captivating, once it gets going. It took me roughly 50 hours to see everything the game has to offer, which is a lot. Pros: Captivating main story, exceptionally well executed world building, great combat system and stunning graphics. Also, the setting feels truly unique and fresh. The DLC Frozen Wilds also expanded the story and gameplay loop in a meaningful way. Cons: Side quests vary drastically in quality with some rather pointless ones. The characters voices are overall too quiet, which makes some dialogues almost impossible to understand without subtitles. Also, some facial animations feel a little stiff. Furthermore, the brilliant main story doesn`t really get going until the middle part of the game. Lastly, the combat against human enemies feels boring compared to combat against machines.

An amazing story, beautiful map, and most importantly-Big dinosaur robots with machine guns. What more do you want?. This game was great and I’m telling you right now and it’s definitely worth your time. Entertainment in this game is impeccable. I loved the game so much it hurt when I finished it, playing ng+ ultra hard and even got the platinum. Horizon zero dawn was a very good game with a good story. For me the gameplay was unnecessarily hard but new and unique.. Overall an excellent game, from its world design, gameplay, and characters. Story is generally easy enough to follow, but expect LOTS of reading if you really want to get into its lore and backstory. It was overshadowed by BotW releasing around the same time, but I found it to be just as enjoyable.. Great graphics and great story. My PS4 is forever in my heart because of this game. Fights against cars, details, all this is what does not let you go from the beginning to the end of the game.. It's a perfect game. Good story. Amazing graphics. Huge walkable living world. Innovative gameplay. One of the best gaming experiences I've had in last 30 years.. Good but for some reason, boring.. Best game I ever played. it's basically like every other open world game released in the last decade... and I did get bored enough of it halfway through that I had to put it down for a bit before going back to finish it... and oh my god why is every single story mission a massive exposition dump... but I still somehow liked it?. I loved it! I really did! It was unique and... 1. Plot Now that is something that kept me hook for a ride. What a original take! My imagination many times went left and right trying to imagine me myself in such a weird world. 10/10 2. Graphics Maybe its a controversial take.. .but for me it was also a 10/10. Loved the colours and the details... 3. Music It was good.9/10 4. Gameplay Once again i can be controversial. It clicked for me! 10/10 5. Open world activities As good as this game was, i think it could be improved in those activities. Not to saying how... But it wasnt bad either. I giveit 8/10 6. Funfactor. Oh boy i had a lot of fun with it. It kept me hooked for hours and i didnt think for a second it a wasted time. 10/10 7. Side characters, dialogs I need to take it out of the equasion, 'cuz i think thats what this game lacked at most. Interactions was lame for most of the time. Side characters not convincing. And stiff dialouges. 4/10 All in all i loed that one! Iplayed it actually 2 ti","the premise for Horizon Zero Dawn is intriguing and combat is generally fun, but the game doesn't manage to hold attention . the world itself is poorly developed, lacks personality and never feels alive . the confusing story never catched me ."
497.Stardew Valley,"**** Valley is a chill game that allows you to own a farm, create relationships, and care for animals. The beautiful art style and peaceful gameplay are the things that make this game so special.. I love this game, I'm not much **** now that I'm in my 40's but something about this game just had me hooked for a few weeks. I guess it's relaxing and not stressful at all to play, you do what you can within the day and go to sleep and try again the next day, if you miss something it will be there next year so no big deal. I highly recommend.. There is a rhythm to this game that you have to really discover, and I really enjoy how many elements of this game interact with each other. However, this game is unfortunately just not my thing. I spent a couple dozen hours in it, but maybe I just need a fresh run and a walkthrough to really ""get it"". This is one of the best video games I have ever played! In the size size words of Jonny RaZeR “This Id Peak!”. This game is the farm sim that every indie and gaming company tries to aspire to. Fun relaxing gameplay, thought out world, and heart make this a must have in the genre. With updates and patches keeping it fresh and a developer who listens to the fans this is how I hope all developers should act.. the only reason its not a 10 is because i genuinely believe this game has so much more potential i hope that it goes even farther and cant wait to see what concerned ape has in store for whatever their next venture. Without a doubt one of the most relaxing games i've ever played. I have 200+ hours into it and even still find myself playing it.. Its a work of art and i enjoying play it for 900 hour with no borning feels. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Super relaxing! Just a fun game i can play whenever i'm bored, the **** valley+ mod really lift it up!. I hate how it is just a cycle. And how the social mechanic is just gifting. It just… feels wrong.. The game is cool, it's relaxing to play sometimes, but the low rating is because it's very expensive (I'm currently living in Brazil) the price here without the promotion is R$25. I have more than a thousand hours played. I have it on switch and computer. My first farming simulator and the best cozy game. I love the music so much. I love the characters. It always impress me how this game was made by just one person.. Stadew valley is a game you can keep coming back to thinking you need something to relax with. Its a very cozy looking game but the more you play the more management you need over your farm and the people in the town. You start to stress over how much you need to get done. I've never beaten the game full on but for a game like this you really don't have to to get a really enjoyable experience.. One of the greatest games of all time. Words cannot express how brilliantly this game is able to bring together the aspects of a farming sim, with deep lore and grounded combat so flawlessly. The game serves as a benchmark for any future competitors to compare themselves to. The only improvement that can be made to this game is getting some friends and having a playthrough with them. Hours upon hours of fun can be had with this fantastic coming together of a wholesome game. Arguably the best value money can buy.. I really wish that i could send an GIF of Homer Simpson saying: BORING!! this game is overrated! very bad, they just throw in an farm wishing that i do all for my own without even instructing me what to do! this game its extremamely repetitive, and i just don't give it a zero because the graphics are mildly interesting. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. **** Valley is a wonderfully charming game that offers endless hours of relaxing gameplay. From farming and fishing to exploring mines and building relationships with townsfolk, there’s always something engaging to do. The pixel art style is nostalgic, and the music is soothing, creating an immersive, cozy atmosphere. It’s easy to get attached to the community and your farm, and the game offers a lot of freedom to play at your own pace. While some tasks can feel repetitive, the game’s depth and variety make it truly enjoyable. Recommended for anyone looking for a peaceful escape!. Wholesome game made by a wholesome developer, who keeps working on free updates even YEARS after release.. Only my favorite game of all time! I have more than 3300h on this game which may sound crazy, but it changed my life in a way. I fell in love with the characters, with the feeling of discovery and being thrown into a universe where you can do so much. YOU personalize your experience, you could only play to romance, or to make money,go to the mine, discover the secrets, this game has literally so much to offer. And when you're done ? INSANE mod community that gives content that is as long if not longer than the actual game. **** is cozy, but it can also be stressful. It'll make you feel. However it is a specific type of rinse and repeat gameplay that is not meant for every player. You must enjoy doing similar tasks everyday, thinking ahead of what to plan, decorate, and be on top of a lot. It can be quite stressful for some, but it makes me feel a thrill. Can't recommend more (unless we could date Robin then the game would go up even more.). The perfect game to relax. Lovable characters, lovable setting, lovable gameplay, lovable graphics. lovable music. This is one game that we NEVER uninstalled from our console and always go back to from time to time. An all-around masterpiece in its simplicity.. i think this style of game isn't for me because i just cannot get into the game and enjoy is despite glowing reviews. thought i would have fun with it as i grew up with and loved minecraft but its just super boring for me.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Incredibly addictive game that, if you've never played of these life/farm sims before - such as somehow not growing up with Harvest Moon -you may not believe. But give it a good chance - especially if you have a friend to play it with! Its got some pretty decent mods too.. If you set aside the reviews from people who are clearly just not suited to this genre, yet felt the need to review-bomb, the numhers and reviews speak for themselves.. **** Valley offers extremely addictive and satisfying gameplay for a very modest price tag. The progression of building up your farm and working towards completing the community center is a fantastic experience, and then the game throws even more at you after that. A ton of content has been added for free over the years. This game is a masterpiece.. As a casual gamer, this is the first game that I spent more than 500+ hours in EZ. Simply a masterpiece.. Best game for anyone who’s looking for a relaxing and enjoying farming simulator type of game. The atmosphere is great, the game is really a must buy.. Fun, not quite my thing. I get the appeal and can appreciate the game for what it is, but not fully get into it. It's gorgeous, the spritework and pixel art looks great, the characters are simplistic while charming, this is one of the only games, where the farming aspect actually works and is fun. Great game, just not my thing. **** Valley is a great game that hooks you from the very beginning. Its seasonal system, where characters and the town change, makes the world feel alive and encourages you to keep improving your farm. It’s even more impressive when you realize it was created by just one person.. call me pedantic but it bugs me that the pixels are inconsistent and they can rotate and scale instead of using an actual grid, takes me out of it. : Hayatımda oynadığım en iyi oyun olabilir. 2000 saat oynadım ve hala aktif olarak oynuyorum. ConcernedApe işini iyi biliyor. Oyun orjinal hali ile yüzlerce saat oynatabiliyor ayrıca mod yüklerseniz bu süre binlerce saate uzayabilir. : It might be the best game I have ever played in my life. I've played 2000 hours and I'm still actively playing. ConcernedApe knows what he's doing. The game can play for hundreds of hours in its original form, and if you install mods, this time can extend to thousands of hours.. Rarely can a game make me forget I’m a living breathing person for hours at a time. **** Valley does that with ease. There’s always something to do, always someone to talk to or give the worst gifts of all time, always something changing the world around you. There’s a lot here, which can be intimidating in the beginning, but which adds plenty of attainable goals and heaps of freedom, allowing you to smoke your crack however you please.. Basically a farming game with a hint of combat Would be more fun if I had a gf to play with.. **** Valley is an indie game that stands out for its impressive design and gameplay, setting a benchmark in the resource management genre.After investing more than 250 hours on Steam, I confirm that this game offers a highly addictive experience thanks to a good combination of simulation and management **** of the most notable aspects is the freedom it offers the player.Unlike other titles that dictate a certain pace, **** Valley allows players to manage their farms and social interactions at their own pace.This autonomy fosters a personal connection to the game and allows each player to develop their own playstyle, further increasing the depth and replay **** characters and worldview designs are carefully **** pixel art graphics are simple but full of details that give life and charm to the **** addition, the progression system is subtle but **** never gets monotonous and there are always new discoveries and improvements, so the game never gets **** balance between simulation mechanics like farming and resource management is achieved very well.Each game system integrates seamlessly to create a consistent and immersive **** short, **** Valley doesn't just meet the expectations **** indie game, it exceeds them.This is a title that deserves top marks not only for its entertainment value, but also for the smart design and creative freedom it offers ****'s a natural 10.. **** Valley was game i played and at first it didn't click with me abut gradually it slow developed and i felt a sense of pride and achievement and then playing with friends to go for 100 % is that feel good and relaxing for my busy anxious mind find some friends if you can, go fish and just let yourself relax **** valley is a unique experience for me and it did something i thought it couldn't do, it made me go from hating its slow boring start to enjoying the pace and then completing it 100%. I love it. Best game to play with your girlfriend. The only negative I can say is maybe the combat. But you won't expect a good and complex combat from a game like this so. It is good. A satisfying and beautiful game. After 100 hours it can get a bit boring though.. 101 hours on Steam and a couple more hours on Xbox This is an addictive game and, after all this time, I feel like everything has already been said in the top reviews here. But one thing that I always like to mention is how the characters have depth and oftentimes ""reward"" you with little bits about their personalities and stories.. I could write a full 10-page essay on this game and it still wouldn't be enough to tell my experience with it. The memories I have of this game will never leave my heart as they have become a core part of it.. One of the best games i've ever played. The ambience and all the details on that its just perfect.. This game is awesome, it's so relaxing and interesting, I love this game, thank you Eric Barone️. A great sim bursting with heart, mystery, and activities to do.............. It's a great thing to get away from the boring gaming industry and have a pleasant time.. thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/thank you/. Just so, so good. As far as the cozy game titles go, I still think it's my favourite so far.. it might be a cliche to say this, but as far as the cozy game titles go, this is still my favourite. I could talk about why this game is so good, but everybody already knows why. it's kinda like cs:go in that way.. **** Valley Is my favorite game i buyed it from steam it teaches u how to farm and do stuff like fall in love no stealling gifting and stuff. Been playing this game for years and have never gave up on it. One of my all time favorites and best game tolay while relaxing. The farming, fishing and mining sums the game up with a challenge and satisfaction feel after playing. Recommend this game on so many levels.. Truly a artistic dynamic masterpiece, after 371 hours playing **** Valley I STILL find the game enjoyable; although for people who do not like cozy, progression based games you may want to stay away as that is exactly what **** perfects upon with the diverse amount of characters and freedom to the player to choose what you want to do and how you want to play allows for endless replayability and breathing room.. I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEE **** VALLEY, this ain't just a game, it's a lifestyle.. Lose so many hours playing **** and I don't think it's ever gonna get old. The co-op is seamless and I love it - playing with someone else is the best way to play imo!. **** Valley is a game near perfection, the ammount of details an love it has is amazing, it has a beautiful art style, great characters, a simple but good story, and a very fun and relaxing game loop. Game itself is great, but DO NOT BUY FOR SWITCH if you plan to play co-op. Game experiences constant lag and frame issues with splitscreen. Forums full of dozens of posts telling the developer it becomes unplayable for late game content. For years. No response at all.. Relax yourself in your first playthrough, then learn how the world progress in this game and stress yourself out in further gameplays more than your real life. The amount of work this game has behind it is overwhelming.. I know a lot of people love it, but i just cannot get past the graphics and the grind. It's like a poor brother of animal crossing. meh, sorry.. This game is a great example of a farming video game done right. The game offers many other options besides being a farmer, such as woodsman, fisherman, blacksmith, adventurer, etc. Over time you may run out of content, but you can solve this by using the modpacks from the amazing community this game has.. This game is fantastic. It’s my third time starting up a new farm, and every time I end up spending many many hours with the game. I enjoy the variety of content that is offered here, and all of it can be enjoyed whether you just casually play it or want to explore the depth of the content. Every single activity has some degree of a pleasant gameplay loop without making any of it overly complex to the point where it’s unenjoyable. When you combine the amount of activities with the amount of time you have in each game day, it creates this pleasant loop that keeps you coming back because you want to see more and more. The graphics, music, characters, environments, everything is just super charming. Everything about this game is this perfect blend of being very simple but having more depth than what it initially seems like. I can easily see myself going back to this game for many years to come. It’s just a comfortable and relaxing experience with the right amount of addictive gameplay loop.. The best of the farm-adventure-building-craft-sim genre out there. Often imitated, many come close and are great in their own regard, but **** Valley remains the big daddy around in my opinion. Lovely, relaxing, emotional, heartwarming and full of fells good moments. Easy to lose a whole day playing, with the ""just one more day"" mentality.. Love thegame but can give you a repetitive feeling after playing for 10 hours. I love this game! I have played this game with my girlfriend and tha was a graet experience )We have finished this game almost for 3 times. The gold standard for any poor new game developer who has the gaul to make a farming game.. Really fun farming simulator game, with a little bit of everything for everyone. Want to fish? You can do it! Want to farm crops? You can do it! Want to go spelunking and hunt monsters? You can do that as well! Definitely recommend you give this game a shot, especially if you have a couple friends to have join alongside you!. ""**** Valley"" is a role-playing game developed and published by ConcernedApe (Eric Barone). The game revolves around a character who inherits a magical farm and decides to rebuild their life away from the hustle and bustle of city living.

With its charming graphics, diverse activities, and interpersonal relationships, the game provides players with an enjoyable farm life experience.. Best game that has ever been made . Cozy , interesting story ,memorable characters , and so much to do .. Honestly this game is just perfect. I can chill, grind, hardtry. It is just amazing <3. its a beautiful game with smooth animations, relaxing ambient sounds and beautiful songs. The characters have a nice and great development, their scenes are very cool and interesting, the story of the characters are immersive and deep and their personalities are unique and special. Have a lot of secrets and abilities to learn, you play it for hours without become boring or get tired, its very fun and help to relax the stress.. Great game, relaxing but with enought content to be deep. A paralel universe for u to forget ur problems.. Would be perfect if I had the option of killing Penny. Aside from her, the game is the most relaxing I have ever played, and I would recommend if you feel the need for a break from stress.. Best farming RPG ever and massive respect to the devs for still updating and keeping the game fresh and alive even after all these years. I simply love this game.. Didn't think I'd enjoy this that much and then ended up playing until 2 AM without realizing it and wanting to do ""just one more day"" Fun gameplay loop, cute graphics, relaxing setting I like it a lot. This game is so underrated,cute little farm game I don't know how anyone could hate it, it has fishing mining farming and forging super relaxing <3. This game really emphasizes community and farming life. I love the interactions with the villagers and the laid-back vibe it gives.. literaly amazing, sm stuff to do and alot of interesting characters and lore… its an amazing game u can pour tons of hours into and its one of my fav indie games of all time. theres literally endless things 2do and theres something for everyone. **** Valley is, without any shadow of a doubt, the best game of 2016, and perhaps the best Harvest Moon game ever made. Every aspect of the game intertwines flawlessly - from the farming itself to the villager interactions - allowing for players to build an intimate connection to their farm and the world they create, which ConcernedApe has allowed for us to tailor down to the finest details.. An easily affordable game that is the best farming game to date, and can be played with friends online too. Cute visuals and a cozy atmosphere make this game a must-buy for anyone who enjoys the genre and still a great game for those who don't. It's also a great game to play with your boyfriend/girlfriend or to introduce someone to the gaming scene.. The best PC game I've ever played. You never gonna be regret it. **** Valley is an exceptional game that offers an immersive and engaging experience for players of all ages and skill levels Thanks to Eric Barone.. great piece of art and love!!! perfect game for relaxing and funny hours!! its just a Masterpiece!!! nothing more to say!. Honestly I don't have a much to say other than it's a really good game but there's always room for improvement. Overall this game is a very comfy RPG. There is no real time limit on completing the game but it does have a time system that keeps things moving and keeps me trying to optimize my farm wasting as little time as possible. Which for me is engaging and enjoyable. Mostly you'll be doing the following 1. Farming, 2. Fishing, 3. Mining/Dungeon Crawling 4. Forestry/Foraging 5. Giving gifts and chatting up the townsfolk The more you do steps 1-4 the more money you make or resources you acquire to grow your new farm. Becoming friendly with the townfolk allows some romance options as well as unlocking additional content that they will often send you as recipes in the mail. Each NPC has a birthday so it's good to check your calendar in the morning so you don't miss out on those bonus friendship gifts. Sadly I have to deduct points for the inclusion of Junimo Kart. This mini game is just full of horrible design choices. Really the entire thing is just bad. It's optional for the most part; except some end game quests which are still optional but for such a polished game to include this borderline broken inclusion just bothers me. Here's a list of issues with the minigame: randomly generated levels, unnatural level design, you can jump above the screen and the camera is locked so it's very easy to lose your position, platforms also spawn at the very top of the level (if you jump on them you're blind). I get the dev probably just wanted to include something simple to spice things up but seriously this is worse then flash game platformers from 20 years ago. It's really just a waste of time sadly. If there are any junimo kart enjoyers out there I would honestly be surprised. Journey of the Prairie King (the other minigame) isn't good either, but I would at least consider it playable.. i dont usually like 2d games but this one is good. Generally not my genre but this game is very good, for a game I expected to be ""funny farmer game"" it was an amazing experience and I recommend to people of all genres.. It's a shame that I wasn't able to enjoy this game more, because there is certainly a masterpiece here. I just never found it.. Quite cozy and chill game, especially when played with a or a friend. partner. What a great experience i can spend days playing just tending my crops and creating artisan products.Very charming pixel art and lovely animals.A true gem a must for farm lovers.. **** valley is the best farming sim I've ever played, while passage of time feels rushed which takes away from the relaxation the game has a thriving modding community that is usually able to fix your problems and enhance your game. This makes **** a product replayable on the levels of things like Skyrim, always leaving you new ways to play.. **** Valley is a joy to play. Each in game day takes about 15 minutes to complete and I constantly found myself saying 'just one more day' late into the night. At this point I have had 2 singleplayer playthroughs and played 3 different multiplayer playthroughs. The game is super relaxing, though at the beginning it can feel a bit overwhelming. There is so much to do and not enough energy! Soon enough you'll have cleaned up your farm and get lost fishing an entire day away. You'll soon find yourself planning your next days activity well in advanced. Is it going to rain? How many crops do I want to plant? Man that is going to be a lot of watering if I do that... The main downside to **** Valley is that you really have to give yourself goals. The game is open ended as far as 'beating' the game. I wouldn't say it's hard to 'beat' the game or anything, which really boils down to can you complete a set of different turn-ins the game sets out for you. It can be a bit of a collectathon in someways, but its definitely not egregious. The romance options can seem a bit limiting, but largely this is due to the fact that it took a lot of inspiration from the Harvest Moon series. Of course that really setup the general set of gameplay, but I believe it perfected the art/genre for Harvest Moon style games. I feel its worth mentioning that this game was fully developed by one person, which in itself is a marvel. They did all the programing, music creation, art asset design, and story writing. Everything all molded by one person really is inspiring. If I were to temper my review with this fact alone I would have a hard time not giving it a 10, but I feel like that then no other game could really compare to it, so when comparing it as a whole I'd say it's easily an 85-90.. It's still a very charming RPG that lingers in my memory. The valuable experiences gained from this game will likely stay with me for a long time.. Cozy game that lets you do a lot of stuff either alone, with your friends or partner. I myself played this game with my girlfriend and it's been nothing but an awesome experience. Loved every minute of it!. this game is very good, its soundtrack is great, the character development is amazing and I have no criticisms for this game.. Best farm game i ever played and not only a farm game u must play that game if u have free time or want to relax. What a masterpiece, for everyone who loves old gameboy styled games. The graphic style is made oldish but the game itself feels so new and innovative, its full of cool ideas, and cute events, many things to do, the only maybe not so perfect categorie in this is the fighting. But even with that, the game made me play 400hours and more.. Most chill vibe game in the world and very casual. Is funny as **** dude like. Tag this game. I'm preparing to play this game, but I haven't started playing yet. I'm just tagging this game so that I can find it easily when I play it in the future.. I never get tired of this game. Since its original release I had bought it multiple times for different platforms, including the Nintendo Switch, Android Phone, Xbox and now PC. **** Valley is a game everyone must experience. 10/10!. it good i like feeling happy while playing games reviews have to be 75 characters so i'm adding this part to fluff it up. The overall controls are bad and the fishing mini game is one of the worst in any video game, and don't get me started on the combat which why does a framing game even have combat in the first place, you'll 100% want to download the following mods from nexus because for some reason there isn't a steam workshop for the game,SMAPI, NPC map locations, Skip fishing minigame,Content patcher, Confirm gifts, and lastly Combat controls- Fixed mouse click (which fixes all the bad mouse controls not just for combat which is otherwise ""unplayable"" with how bad the controls are for the combat) These are all petty much must have mods if you actually want to be able to enjoy the game. With those mods and anymore yoy decide to try the game is fine but the game without mods i CAN NOT RECOMMEND. A spiritual successor to Harvest Moon that manages to surpass it. I was hesitant at first but it's truly an amazing game. It could only be improved with better character art.. It doesn't explain why this game is one of the best indies out there because just by playing the first year of the game you can already see how good it is.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A pioneer in its genre and indie games. Thanks to Dear Eric Barone for being so persistent in creating this game.. Great game. Returned after years, and it’s still good playing gameplay. Also tried to play coop with a kid, it was fun.. I want to be a farmer. I want to catch a fish. I want to go to mine. I want to spend all of my money for gift.. I have to text something without another option if I want to rate the game: ten points. Enough? Haha.. **** Valley is a peaceful, feel-good video game. Building your own farm and foraging around the map can be quite satisfying. The story and NPCs are okay. The amount of action and battle is a bit underwhelming. You can play it with friends which is great.. 10/10 **** Valley is a amazing game! You can get hot **** which i cant do irl.. When I first played this game, I couldn't imagine how great it would be. While you wait a little above average, **** Valley offers you a great experience with its gameplay, story, music, art and all other characters. The game is a good game for distraction outside of normal times. You can easily warm up to and bond with the characters and everything else. ConcernedApe has done a truly admirable job, a heart-warming production. This is the highest rating I can give for this game. 10. Simply perfect.. **** takes a simple concept and turns it into something so touching and magical. I love this game. The art style is charming and the music is beautiful. The best part is that there are so many hidden secrets that you can discover.. Story - 8 Gameplay - 10 Graphics|Visuals - 8|10 (The difference is, the graphics are ok, but the way the graphics are used is a 10/10 if that makes sense). SFX|Music - 10|9 Pleasure - 10 Atmosphere - 10 Length - About 50 hours, and about 160 for 100% Replayability - For sure, you can go back with mods, for 100% completion, or just for fun because now you know how to play the game. Co-Op|Co-Op Enjoyability - Yes|10 NPCs - 8 Combat - 8 Controls - 9 Mod Community - 10 Cross Platform - No. (As of Feb 2023). What it's like to play: **** Valley is a grindy farming game. You farm, ranch, mine, fish, and build relationships with the NPCs in Pelican Town. But of course Pelican Town isn't the only location in **** Valley. You can visit another location that I won't spoil. However there is a negative of this game. It's a confusing game, and you will almost definitely need to use the wiki page to know how to do a lot of stuff. Overall: 8.6 I highly recommend this game, 10/10 for me. Although it totals to 8.6, I truly love this game. The negative of needing a wiki is only a problem because of how much amazing content there is.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the worst **** that can have tried I regret a lot and all because a friend recommended it to me, an indie with the same mediocre and poor design that all indies have, and the typical farm game where you do every **** day the same job as a slave and on top of that you earn nothing and with a boring story. I give it a point because it has many redhead fem","**** Valley is a chill game that allows you to own a farm, create relationships, and care for animals . i have 200+ hours into it and even still find myself playing it for 900 hour with no borning feels . the game is cool, it's relaxing to play sometimes, but the low rating is because it's very slow ."
498.Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition,"I’ll say right away that I’m a fan and my opinion shouldn’t be taken into account.. One of the Best games ever if not the best ever made. Like every game there’s a couple flaws , but for each step back it takes 10 steps forward. Story might not be the most complex ever and environments might not be the most unique but it perfectly encapsulates what a game is meant to be . Fun. One of the most action pact video game of all time l recmond playing this game over the previous games because it made devil may cry alive again. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Extremely fun combat and wacky characters. The gameplay is running from zone to zone and styling on enemies. It's extremely fun and satisfying to pull of cool combos. In the end, the gameplay of V drags it down a bit, and I didn't feel myself get drawn back when I finished it.. The pinnacle of action games , near perfect gameplay (no devil breaker switch , V didn't click for me) , the soundtracks are immaculate , everything a DMC fan could've asked for , but due to the lack of story quality and poor design of the world , it's a 9 for me (PLS REMAKE DMC 3 PLS PLS CAPCOM). wish there was the .5 option but there isn't. Anyways, Devil May Cry 5 is the definitive action hack and slash game. The combat is near perfect, characters are amazing and entertaining as hell, soundtrack is phenomenal. Anything else that needs to be said that hasn't been said already? Only minor issue with the game is THAT DAMN TELEPORTING LIZARD THAT GOT ME PISSED OFF ON DMD MODE. If your new to the DMC franchise and don't wanna start with the original than DMC 5 is the perfect place to start although story wise is going to be confusing. One more thing, vergil is the coolest gaming character of all time period.. one of the particularly good versions, I think it deserves praise. Looking forward to other versions that will be even better.. Good enough that I have to spend money to own this product. Hopefully Capcom's future DMC products will be even better quality.. It's the same great game but now it has some improvements like every game in the special edition of the saga has, and of course there's also the fact that the storm is approaching!. still hard as ****, but also interesting as ****, You have to play this, the soundtrack is crazy. The absolute best version of this game and the pinnacle of combat in the entire series. A love letter to fans.. 9.5 Wish there was a feature to play the entire story line levels a any character you want after you bet the game once.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. i love you dmc, my best Hack and slash game, i love you capcom best game single player game. It's my 1st DMC game if not count some half-hour attempt to play a PC port of DMC3, I believe, back in the school days. You could only imagine how terrible of an experience it was. Wasn't sure what to expect from this one, but it turns out quite a fun run. Among the minuses, I can highlight a rather mediocre plot - firstly, the video about previous chapters is itself quite confusing and does not really shed light on the events and characters. However, as far as I understand, this is a rather trivial thing when it comes to DMC. The plot of the current part, although in some places it pleases with its humor and some twists, but on the whole it looks more like an excuse for all the action happening around, rather than a truly important and well-written story. Speaking of the action, it is quite well staged, varied and fresh. However, despite this and the rather modest size of the main story, at some point the gameplay begins to feel repetitive and uses the same level patterns, despite the changing main characters, weapons and enemies. Overall, this is a pretty nice game, with great graphics, ok humor and fun action. Yet, it's hard to call it outstanding or impressive enough to recommend the game for everyone.. Best game, even better than Devil May Cry 5: Not Special Edition, even better than GTA 6. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The game is great the gameplay is good the platforming is kinda good the characters are good but the story is bad. THIS IS THE GOAT OF THE INTIRE DEVIL MAY CRY SERIES. very good combat and good characters (apart from v). Bought a console after many years and was trying to have fun with new games, but wasn't getting the thrill that I used to get years ago until I downloaded this amazing game. I loved every second of it. Everything about it screams the kind of games I love. I'm not even sure if any other game can top this feeling anytime soon. Superaction games. DMC IS BACK ! Perfect gameplay, love it.. Devil May Cry 5 brings a lot to the table, with so many variety of playable characters and a lot of replay value. The issue is the very predictable story. However the game-play enhances a fun experience overall.. Dante:""It's over Vergil! Devils Never Cry! Vergil:""That's where you're wrong Dante, Devil May Cry "". Just for the combat system game deserves the credit. You could spend 100 hours mastering it.. That's a amazing game.Fight,boss is wonderful and finally i have played as vergil , i think you give chance this game. A must buy game for any Action game fans, especially a DMC fan. This is the climax of the entire series.. It was a fun ride, even though a bit short ! Playing differents characters, trying their abilities and power was entertaining. And the pacing of the game is well done. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Most fun game I have played so far.‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎. A well rounded gameplay, a fantastic graphic and memorable characters are enough to carry the game. But the plot and a level design not really inspired like this don’t feet very well with the rest. A 7.5 is good for this. With the unlocked fps and dlc I give this an 8. second best gameplay after 4 and second best story after 3. Overall, it took the number 1 place in the series.. This is the first DMC I played. For the first 10 hours I honestly didn't get it. It seemed like an easy button mashing game. Also, having to hold R1 felt stupid and finger cramping. But then I got the game: you are not meant to defeat enemies here, you are meant to *destroy* them like some black belt master ninja badass. Pulling off those crazy combos switching weapons/styles/moves leaving enemies like ""wtf just happened?"", and getting an ""S"" rank is tough, and very satisfying. The skill cap in these games is the highest I've ever seen. The graphics. sound and ost are among the best I've ever seen also. After multiple playthroughs of dmc5 I got dmc 1 and 3, and enjoyed those too, be warned that those are much older and somewhat janky.. Tried to get into the game but honestly it's very hard. Combat while complex to me seems to be lacking a good way to transition the player from being ""bad"" to ""good"". Controls felt clunky and after playing other hack n slashes I feel like there's better games out there. I think Bayonetta does a better job at introducing its controls and have a more fluent but also complex combat system. I understand some people will enjoy this game more than me. But i think if anyone's going to buy this game they should be aware that the skill ceiling might not make it enjoyable for everyone.. I love story and lot action and excellent graphic and haptic feedback control. i love this franchise to death and that may make my opinion on this game a bit biased, i think that this game is a top tier hack and slash with beautiful graphics, goofy dmc humor, and amazing gameplay. The gameplay lacks a bit of snap that dmc 3 has and it only feels satisfying when you're playing as Vergil which on the other hand makes the game too easy, the bosses on their own aren't the best gameplay wise, although the killer soundtrack saves it, i still think that even with it's flaws, this is the definitive DEVIL MAY CRY experience. Devil May Cry 5 is great game with extreme good playable characters and combo styles. But unlilke dmc devilmay cry we play same story as every characters same places and enemy styles. There were diffrent places for vergil in dmc game but not in five. Also story is ****. The dodge mechanic, the sole way to avpid damage isn't reliable or responsive. You can be not in the middle of an attack, spamming the dodge command, and your character simply won't dodge about half the time. Other times the dodge actually occurs, but you still get hit. Garbage controls and mechanics result in an unfun, frustrating, artificial difficulty fest. But I'm sure some people will bang their heads against the wall until the game lets them win, and feel proud about themselves. Hence, the high ratings. Don't pay one red cent for this dumpster fire.. Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.. Wacky woohoo pizza man with his twin brother sitting a plastic chair and his without child support. DEVIL MAY CRY IS BACK BABY! Such a great game with a in-depth combat system, challenging gameplay and a BADASS soundtrack! The way the music advances the more style you get from D to SSS is so fun and unique. The game’s story will not make sense to anyone who hasn’t played the older games, but thankfully they made a video on the title screen to get a recap or learn about the story to have a much better understanding of it. The only reason I rate it 8 is the **** micro transactions that basically make you skip the game. You are a lazy sack of **** if you buy the red and blue orbs btw. The super characters that you unlock after beating one of the hardest difficulties is a great reward, but yet again you can buy these from the game store you have on your console. If you enjoy 3D Hack-and-slash games then I SERIOUSLY recommend buying if you don’t own it already.. Looks good. Plays a like a last gen game. Ultimately a lot of dumb fun and fun is good. The controls are odd. You press R1 with other buttons to do certain special attacks. After 6 hours, the control scheme still felt weird. The game wants you to play with style. Mix and match moves to earn style points. Mixing face buttons with shoulders buttons is not the best way to do this. There is also no dedicated dodge or roll button. I am on old school gamer who played Ninja Gaiden on Xbox. My muscle memory demands a roll button. Another gripe I have with this game is the series of closed off battle arenas. An area locks down until you kill wave after wave of enemies. Then you can progress. I have no problem with “corridor shooters” and linear games that eschew the open world. But games lose their sense of movement and freedom when they arbitrarily fence off an area. If I am to move this story from point A to point B, let me move. The fighting itself is a mixed bag. Weapons feel week, even on the easier modes. Guns have almost no impact and a sword lunge has no penetration. The point of combat seems to be working off combos, and if you like hitting triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, you love it. So what makes this game fun? It’s the odd assortment of weapons and goofiness. At one point, the player unlocks a sword made out of a motorcycle. Other games don’t have that. You can taunt enemies, hear fun little asides, and fill up the screen with a laser light show. There is something good about this combat. I can see how an old school following would appreciate this game. For me, this is was my first time. All-in-all, Devil May Cry 5 has a fun formula that could be little better if the game design were a tad more modern. Full disclosure: this was another PS+ Essential game for me. I blasted through the campaign in about 6 hours and never looked back. The trophies call upon players to finish several play throughs. Parts the game have players choose which character to follow. Back in old days, when games were a little more scarce, I would replay games at least once. Now my backlog is overflowing, and one fun little jaunt through a demon infested city is just fine.. The action is not exhilarating. Enemies are hard. No interesting new actions. New characters are boring. The character's face is too different from the previous ones.. Live how the game plays. It is a very nice touch to the launch game. Buy this if you don't have the game already.. One of my favorite games of all time. I personally don't play hack and slashes for their stories, instead I focus completely on characters and gameplay. The combat is nuts to butts, it's always fun and fast-paced with no dull moment in sight. The story is sufficient, and interesting. I love all of the characters and their weapons and abilities. Awesome soundtrack and great graphics. 92, no questions asked.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Amazing story, scenery and gameplay. I also love the fact that Vergil became a playable character. His design and combos are astuning, Judgement Cut End being one of the most iconic things in this game.. Boring game, boring combat, boring gameplay, boring level design, old darksiders much better! Not recommend to buy. Best in the series in my opinion. It has very fun and addicting gameplay with Dante and Nero's being the most fun. I enjoyed V's a little bit less because it was a lot slower paced than the others but it wasn't bad. Graphics and music are great too. Not a lot to say about the game negatively. The only major complaint I had was the camera being inconsistent a lot of the time. It would zoom in and out and it was really disorienting. Also I didn't really like V's gameplay that much. Other than that it is an amazing game.. Insane game, Very nice cutscenes, 10/10 Music this is one of those games which people find through music it's just that good. Insane gameplay mechanics, never gets boring to do more combos xD The ending was really cool, Hope they make next part of the series!! :). Pointless hack and slash, very boring gameplay. Feel and setting is cringe and immature. The best combat I have ever experienced in a video game. Amazing visuals with great enemy design and great replay-ability. The story is great and fun for the most part until the ending, where I have mixed feelings of where they took the plot of the game.. Very fun and interesting game! Personally i thought it lost steam a bit in the middle but it picked up by a ton near the end!!. I love this game. I find it hard to replay this alot because it is rather linear, but the combat depth, the characters and the visuals are nice.. Which one of you drunk **** over at Capcom programmed mission 10 because it's the most broken **** I've ever seen. I've been trying to get an S rank on this **** for hours on Son of Sparda difficulty and it's literally impossible because one of you over there decided that the the stylish points requirement should be ridiculously high. worst mission in the game and Dante **** because he has to much **** to manage. trophies are also disabled with vergil too because we both know he's the superior brother and makes S rank easy but you **** that up aswell............... ****. Cool Music, nice Gameplay, one of the worst and boring Leveldesigns in the last half of the gam ive ever seen. Challenging, flashy, and fantastic. Everything I expect from a DMC game! Hopefully we'll continue to get more high quality releases like this rather than the ups and downs of 3 and 4.. A strong 7.5. This was my first DMC game, so this review would be more targeted towards newcomers of the series rather than veterans which I'm sure would have a much different impression than I did. The positives were that the art direction of this game are phenomenal; paired with the gorgeous graphics, it made this game a visual treat to play. The combat system is difficult to learn and difficult to master. I am actually a fan of complex combat systems, so this was a positive for me but may be a negative for some players. Overall the combat was extremely satisfying when properly learned and executed. I loved the idea of three different character arcs providing three different combat experiences, and it was fun (and challenging) adjusting between them as you played through the game. My first negative with the game is that the bosses and environments felt like somewhat of a let-down. All of them were good fights, but none were particularly memorable for me except maybe the final fight. Additionally, the environments felt same-same throughout the game. More variety could have been introduced throughout. The story also felt somewhat weak, but I'm not going to judge an action game too harshly on the story. I felt like the game could have been a bit longer to flesh out the character arcs more. I felt like I never got fully ""into"" the game, and just as I was getting the flow the game ended. Still, a very strong action game and I look forward to more DMC in the future now!. Back into the series since DMC 3 and it's exactly what I remember fast and fun combat interesting characters. The best game of devil may cry franchise I ever played fights in this game so fantastic and I hope we will see new character in devil may cry 6 with another best fights and slashes. Graphics: 9 Sound: 10 Gameplay: 9 Story: 9 Longevity: 8 Entertainment: 9 Total: 9. I am a fan of hack and slash games, but I am pretty particular with the ones I enjoy because there is a fine line between difficulty and button mashing. This game unfortunately walks a little too close to that line my liking. The issue lies within the pacing of the game. I appreciate that you’re able to control several different characters with completely different play styles, but it was done pretty poorly. One of the characters is literally just button mashing and nothing else, the next character has some complexity but feels very simple, and the last character has some degree of complexity to the play style. The enemies are also pretty boring and don’t provide the correct challenge. They are damage sponges, so it takes a lot to take them down, but their attacks and movements aren’t very complex so really you can just button mash your way through the vast majority of encounters. The story is bland and all over the place but somewhat comes together in the end. The graphics are pretty decent, but the soundtrack is the strongest feature of the game - it flows very well with the gameplay. The game is as complex as you make it. That’s not to say this is a bad game because it’s still fun, but it’s definitely not a memorable hack and slash game. It almost feels like this game was a fan service.. An amazing game with fantastic visuals and an amazing story that never stops giving. lazy capcom makes a game like that and doesn't support 21:9 monitors ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the game is really cool and immersive I liked it a lot, congratulations to the manufacturer. really good. As soon as I finished DMC 5 I had to sit down and comprehend what I played… and to catch my breath after the intensity that was the final boss. To me DMC 5 is the best game in the franchise. First off this is the most gorgeous looking game in the series and one of the best looking games of the PS4/XBOX ONE generation. The Photorealism was the right call and it shows that the RE Engine can handle action games. It’s quite fitting that it did use the engine from Resident Evil 7 since DMC was suppose to be a Resident Evil game. The story may not be strong, I mean these games aren’t exactly known for their stories, but it does have a lot of memorable moments like Rebellion being destroyed, Neros Devil Trigger awakening, the resurrection of Vergil, and the greatest moment of all: Dante doing the moon walk. What this series is known for is gameplay and boy does DMC 5 have it. To no surprise everyone has their own play style, Nero being my favorite because of his sword base moves. His new abilities the Devil Breakers all haver their own powers like a chain whip, electricity, time stop, and the literal Mega Buster (my personal favorite next to Punch Line). They are fun, but their draw back is that the only way to switch between them is to self destruct the one you are currently using, so you better make sure you equip your favorites in a specific order. The decision to not switch them up is puzzling, that would be like if Dante threw away his guns. You could argue that equipping 8 Devil Breakers would make combat easier, but why not just leave it at 4 or 3? Dante has less sword moves compared to Nero in favor of more weapons like the Cavaliere (the coolest motorcycle/sword hybrid ever created), the King Cerberus and Sin Devil Trigger (which is like the Super Sayan God form). Then there’s V who ironically stays away from the action from a distance and lets his demons do the fighting for him. This is so drastically different from other characters yet it doesn’t feel out of place. Lastly there is Vergil who’s play style is as smooth as butter, Pulling off Judgement Cut End is never not satisfying. Everyone is fun in their own way and I never got bored with any of them. Acting wise everyone is on point. Ruben Langdon (who can probably play Dante in his sleep at this point) portrays a more mature, but still fun loving protagonist in Dante. While Johnny Yong Bosch (a personal favorite of mine) delivers his own sarcasm and swagger to Nero. Most JYB’s best roles are considered to be Ichigo, Vash, Lelouch, and Izaya, but I would put Nero up there as some of his best work especially during the final mission. Brian Hanford gives V an ominous and tranquil tone which helps add to the mystery of who V is. And Wendee Lee as Trish who sadly does not get a lot of screen time, but does a serviceable job with what she is given, a shame Trish wasn’t in the game that much because this was perfect casting. (I would also like to point out that including Daniel Southworth that makes four actors in here who were on Power Rangers… just a fun fact). Other then the devil arms my other gripe was that there was no playable Trish of Lady. Last time we got a Special Edition of a DMC game Vergil, Trish and Lady were all included as playable characters yet this time we only got Vergil. I know they didn’t get enough screen time in the game but they didn’t in DMC4 either and they became playable. If they were I honestly would have called DMC5 the magnum opus of the series. Overall DMC5 is my favorite game in the franchise and I absolutely recommend playing it.. Guys don't buy this game, I've made an account just to warn you. This is garbage, one of the worst games ive ever played. Story is really bad, the controls are nasty, AND IT HAS MICROTRANSACTIONS IN SINGLEPLAYER that can revive you after death, and because of that the game is pretty unbalanced. Avoid buying this.. It's good for the genre. But not amazing. Played all the others and this one is not my favourite.. A great port of an already great game. The faster loading times are a huge boon, as is the improved resolution. Despite the often cheesy one liners, this is an easy recommendation for fans of character action game. It’s priced right, too.. I just wanna **** Lady’s warm and wet ****. Didn’t like the controls though. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For fans of Devil May Cry, this is the game we have been waiting for since 2008. Dante and Nero are back in their full glory, with the combat set to perfection with one of the most addictive and satisfying combat loops I have experienced in a long time. And if you are playing on console, Special Edition is the way to go, though you're not left out if you don't have access to the new hardware. My biggest criticism is the way mission scoring works, but it's not the worst thing and it does not take away too much from the strengths of the game.. Still one of the best action games of all time all characters are fun to use and play an end epic ending to the franchise, an amazing game and now it run perfectly on PS5 so there's no excuse to not play it. Devil may cry 5 is the best action game ever.............................................................. Big DMC fan here. Though it’s not without its flaws, DMC 5 is a game where action is king. A layperson might think God of War and DMC 5 exist in the same genre, but they don’t. DMC 5 isn’t about going on an epic journey, meeting characters, and uncovering the mysteries of a world. It’s about riding a **** rocket, flying it between enemies, flipping over a demon and shooting it in the head. It’s about pulling up your hood, taunting the hordes of Hell, and somersaulting sideways at the last second before launching into a flurry of sword strikes. It’s about murdering ten demons without your feet ever touching the ground. It’s about fighting and looking cool while you do it. In that, it’s an unparalleled success. Addition of Vergil gives a fresh feel to the game. But i was expecting Vergil to be playable in the main story.. The greatest action game ever made. Fun characters, beautiful graphics, incredible soundtrack, and -most importantly- perfect gameplay.. Amazing, and graphically stunning running on a smooth 120fps on the incredible PS5.. This is a high action game. I’m not the biggest hack & slash fan so this isn’t my favorite type of game. I found the beginning to be fun and exciting. However it quickly gets very repetitive. Basically go through either a crumbling city or the depths of Hell settings. The enemies are not varied with only about 4-5 different typical enemy types. Bosses are a bit better. This isn’t a difficult game as I don’t think I died once. Overall I wasn’t that impressed with it except the music is really good. I wouldn’t really recommend. I’m selling my copy.. I’ve been playing some 10/10 games lately, some tough acts to follow. But I gotta say, with DMC5 SE I’ve had some of the most fun moments I’ve had playing a game in a very long time. I play it with ray-tracing off and high frame-rate mode on. For a game like this, you really feel the significant difference in gameplay. The ray-tracing with high frame-rate off is cool for novelty, I’d suggest you give it a try. But when it comes time to really get into the gameplay, turn off ray-tracing and focus on the high frame-rate for sure. It’s not a perfect 10/10 but this is the pinnacle of hack & slash. Over-the-top action, extremely flashy & stylish, enjoyable story + cutscenes, lots of personality. To put it simply, this game is a good time. It’s like choosing to watch Action Jackson instead of The Green Mile. Capcom is back in their prime.. The lore/story/thematic integration of the dmc series hady never particularly interested me, and it's the same case here. However, the action gameplay itself is some of the best in the general. Unfortunately, the gameplay experience is marred by uninteresting ""puzzles"" and platforming in-between enemy encounters. Still, a high water mark for modern action gameplay. This game is a straight 9.5! Too bad I can't rate 9.5 in Metacritic. Pro's: - Playing as Vergil is soul satisfying. - Playing as Dante is soul satisfying too. - Vergil and Dante made me feel like this is one of the best rpg game I ever played. - The level design is amazing. - PS5 Haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for Nero are fun to play and well implemented - 120 fps mode. Of course! - Final battle is so good. It increases the adrenaline rush a lot. A lot. Cons: - The fire animation is so childish. I laughed the first time I saw that. - I noticed frame rate drops during intense battles. Jitters that I haven't felt in a long time. - Combat is fun but it can get a little overwhelming with each player having their own combinations. Apart from the above points, this is truly one of the best rpg game I ever played.. A varied soundtrack for each character, excellent graphics, multiple techniques and combinations, a worthy plot. Not the best bosses and mob designs, the soundtrack is not bad, but something is missing in it. The start of the game sags a bit and also lacks puzzles. The game breathes with the spirit of the elderly Dante, but still it is not bad.. Devil may cry 5, looks and plays great, I played most of the dmc games. to date dmc5 is the best in the series, Capcom is shining with content.. Im replaying DMC 5 on the ps5 and its much better graphics and frame rate. I love these games and playing as vergil through the game is a plus, the game is on sale used at games & Id recommend picking up a copy if u haven't yet. My top 5 favorite game of the century. The best action game ever created the best DMC game ever created yes even better than DMC 3 SE Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition is better than the original DMC 5, thanks to the many additions like playable Vergil, Turbo Mode and Legendary Dark Knight difficulty. ray tracing and DualSense support are massive game-changers they add so much to the atmosphere the gameplay the lighting combat visuals and the art of the game, they round up the package nicely and help making more than a worthy purchase for every Devil May Cry fan doesn't matter if your an oldschool fan or a casual walking in for the first time you gonna have a great time the game has a plot movie you can watch that explains what happened in the story in the past 4 games the art in this game is amazing the devil triggers are the best ever made the game has plenty of replayability with bloody palace and more difficulties this game on dante must die and Hell and Hell difficulty is the hardest DMC game out of all DMC games but thankfully you have the void to practice as much as you want and learn the enemy moveset and practice your stylish combos and for those who did not have yet the pleasure to experience the best character Vergil in action games this is your chance to jump and experience a phenomenal development of characters this game has the best music every character is unique funny cocky bad ass and has his own personality and his moveset and the combat is the best ever made in any game period on par with the combat god of war 4 2018 the bosses are unique this game has the best boss designs ever created and are most memorable the only problem with this game is the lock on system Director Hideaki Itsuno never learned his lesson from seeing Director Hideki Kamiya's Devil May Cry 1 which had the worst camera in any game the DMC 5 camera is improved so much from DMC 1 but the camera lock on is still an issue if there is a DMC 6 which i am hoping for one of the focuses must be on creating a better camera system the lock in DMC 5 is bad it locks on to the target you don't want it to lock on the game kinda has a soft lock on which always targets the wrong target and Legendayr dark knight diffuclty that becomes a real problem since so many enemies are on the screen you just have to play without locking on if you haven't played this game PS5 is the best way to experience the best action DMC game ever made Let's Rock Baby.. This is definetly a good comeback. This is actually a pretty good Devil May Cry! Gameplay is awesome, graphics are astonishing and the music is great! The only bad thing... is the whole plot. It feels really forced from the start, and it has too much fanservice. Overall, this game rocks!. This game is certainly one of the best modern videogames. It surpassed DMC4 and 3. Intriging gameplay (every playable has its own style) incredible music, beautiful stage and character design, humorous as always! If you are looking for a good action game, oh boy.... Buy this one!. + Story is pretty good though takes a while to really get going. Some funny moments in there. + The cut scenes are very well animated and look great. + Music for the most part is good as you would expect. + Combat when not playing as V is very good. - The ray tracing ****. You can have it with a unstable 30 fps or just 1080p. I switched it to off. - The entire second half of the game has really dull copy paste environments to go though. - V is a terrible character to pl",l recmond playing this game over the previous games because it made devil may cry alive again . the gameplay is running from zone to zone and styling on enemies. it's extremely fun and satisfying to pull of cool combos .
499.The Last of Us Part I,"Pretty solid, but safe remake (but in this case, it works). Overall i would recommend.. After a long period of ignoring what everyone said about this game, I finally played. Boy, it is really something. I loved the character development. I understood why you did it, Joel.. Playing it for the first time in 2013 felt different. Right now, after so many good 3-d person view games I think it doesn't have anything special. Good plot, really good graphics, but very slow and uncomfortable gameplay.. They made it a better version of this masterpiece without, however, adding new content. No flaws in sense of gameplay or cinematic were seen. I felt somehow nostalgic while playing everything all over again. It's an incredible game, but the price does not justify the pros and, unfortunately, highlights the cons.. IT'S THE BEST **** GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED.1: Joel and Ellie have the best relationship in the entire game 2: GREAT graphics 3: how to improve weapons are **** PERFECT 4: I shed a few tears 5: PLAY IT **** YOU WON'T REGRET IT. Interesting linear game with many game mechanics and a good plot. Cool main characters.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My 5th or 6th playthrough of this game, and had to pick up the remake for the PS5 and damn this still hits.. This is one of the very best games you can play right now. The level of perfection is just unbelievable. Adding so much gameplay improvements makes this title the most intuitive (by also keep complexity) game I’ve ever played. I also very appreciate the difficulty settings they have added. A perfect demonstration about that accessibility is more important than the developers choice of how difficult the game has to be. I’ve played this on the Pro console, delivering one of the most impressive visuals I’ve ever seen in a video game. Naughty Dog really has nailed it. Thanks for this incredible experience.. The Last of Us Part I is a timeless masterpiece, and this remake brings it to perfection. Naughty Dog has managed to take an already phenomenal game and elevate it with modern visuals, smoother animations, and improved accessibility features. The stunning graphics, enhanced environments, and revamped character models make Joel and Ellie’s journey feel more alive and emotionally resonant than ever before. The story remains unmatched—a gripping tale of survival, love, and loss that sets the gold standard for narrative-driven games. Every scene, every line of dialogue, and every emotional moment hits just as hard, if not harder, thanks to the remake's technical upgrades. Whether you're a longtime fan or experiencing this game for the first time, The Last of Us Part I is the definitive version of one of gaming's greatest achievements. It’s a must-play for anyone who loves storytelling, unforgettable characters, and immersive gameplay.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Oh man the story is amazing, but damn the graphics look so fresh to me really loved it even platinumed the game i really recommend this, good gameplay, soundtrack and story. Real must play and I love that the story end with this part and that they will never ruin the legacy of this game. Absolute MUST play for any PS5 owner, incredible game and series. I personally preferred TLOU2, but still rate this one as one of my favourite games, ever. The relationship development of Joel and Ellie is heart warming, desperate, relatable, and an emotional rollercoaster. Gameplay is fun, and satisfying. If you've never played any of the Last of us games, you;'re in for a treat playing the remastered versions on PS5. Enjoy!. Can't even rate this **** on steam as it crashes my PC to bluescreen before it's even able to register played time while building shaders.. Very good upgrade. It brings to a PS5 level technic. We you go back to the old version, ithe gap is more visible. A very good way to live this so strong story.. An incredibly written masterpiece of narrative-driven gameplay; The game features stunning graphics and a powerful story. Unfortunately the game does have quite a few bugs with graphical artefacts that require you to restart your game or your computer, and it does crash quite often (coming from someone with an Intel Ultra 9 186H, an RTX 4050, and 32GB RAM).. What an amazing experience. Naughty Dog nailed the linear format with this title. Only thing keeping it from being a 10 is the pretty horrible optimization. Once you get your settings down it improves immensely.. One of the few games nowadays that can catch and not let go. Story-wise it is one of the best games I have ever had the chance to play. The story is very engaging, it's interesting to watch the development of the main characters' relationship. The remaster features gorgeous graphics that are a joy to look at, more than once I found myself just stopping and admiring the beautiful environments and artwork. The only negative I would add to this game is that it will sadly come to an end one day. I could see this game going on forever.. Graphically stunning. I really like the story, environment, sound design, music, and overall mood. My only issue is the clunky combat system — it doesn’t live up to the sequel. After playing TLOU Part II, I really miss features like the dodge option, going prone, and hiding in tall grass etc. This is where it becomes clear that you’re playing a game that’s a decade old. Otherwise, it’s a great game with few issues. this game was great, whether it's the story or the gameplay, even nowadays it all feels very good, it's a game that everyone should play, I played it twice and won the platinum thropy in this game.. a game that I played with great enthusiasm and because many users talk about it and many have advertised it, but my personal opinion is; very, very beautiful graphics, well-made characters, the plot and theme is sacrifice, well-drawn characters, well-built post-apocalyptic world, on the gameplay side it is simple but decent, a masterpiece of art.. Excellent game in every aspect! Story, graphics and gameplay are top-notch. If you haven't played this yet, dont wait!. This is a ""Remake"", yet it still plays the exact same as the Original. Honestly just feels like a second remaster, and story is still unchanged and gameplay still very mediocre, as it always was in this game.. It has everything, story, graphics, adrenaline rush,everything..what else possibly a gamer could ask for.. The benchmark for all games. Never have I experienced a game like the last of us. One of the best stories in gaming.. A story game that neglects some of the best combat of all-time. Joel and Ellie’s adventure across America is filled with dramatic moments and emotional pitfalls. It tells of familial love and loss in the face of inevitability. The DLC of the game should have been more meaningful incorporated into the base game. Playing through the entirety in a play through makes it feel disjointed from the story. The combat is the best in terms of gunplay. The guns have weight and impact. Each feels like it’s taken straight from a film. The most common enemy will be other humans. This provides a lot of firefights in different set pieces. The most intense encounters are with the fungal infected humans that have taken over the world. I wish that there were more enemies and more challenging engagements as the combat is so satisfactory. The lack of additional modes or content makes this remaster far from perfect. Aggressive play styles can lead to visual hiccups and bugs. The game has a new coat of paint, but is far from polished. There is very little to differentiate it from the original. It can be recommended to new players, but not returning ones.. This deserves a 10 for me, I like the story. The graphics are awesome, gameplay is superb, and the plant zombies are Hella terryfying. I wish they didn't make Ellie, a lesbian though.. The original is one of my favourite games of all time and this is really an enhancement on that experience. They changed barely anything except the fluidity of the gameplay and of course, it looks incredible. I got it ""for free"" because of PS Premium but if you've never played it, I'd still recommend this version. However, looking at the price difference compared to the remastered ps4 version, if you're short on cash, I'd go for the remastered version.. Ah yes, the masterpiece of gaming that is The Last Of Us, the best game of all time according to many gamers. But is it that true? I'd say no. That's not to say this is a bad game as the story and characters are well written. That is easily the highlight of this game. However, the gameplay isn't worth bragging about. In fact, it's just ok. I don't really find this game fun to play but more or less fun to witness. It's a game that you wanna watch the story unfold and just get through the mediocre to boring stealth battles. Overall, it's a good game that is held back by its boring gameplay.. Good remake with a wonderfull graphic, good to play it at 7th time with upgrated graphic.. I mean, does it get much better than this game? The music, the characters, the story, and the gameplay are all legendary.. I played The Last of Us Part I in 2024 and thought it was a great game that I liked.. The Last of Us defines Polish, or at least it should. The Last of Us is not for the faint of heart. It takes a premise that should sound silly, namely mushroom zombies, and spins such an immersive story of societal collapse that the first 20 minutes of it are fully capable of traumatizing folks, then spends 20 hours of running time building them back up, only to have them tumble into the very heart of darkness in a way that only video games can. It’s an incredible, an outstanding game. Even if it does rest on some quite conventional foundations. Don’t get me wrong, the gameplay basics are more than solid, but stalking mushroom zombies and savage ex-office workers doesn’t feel that different from, say, Aloy sneaking up on a pack of robo-dinosaurs, when it comes to the pushing of the buttons. The foraging of resources, the crafting of tools, the actual combat, all these gameplay mechanics are nothing new, they are well implemented examples of their trope and nothing more. What makes the difference is the metric ton of polish and verisimilitude Naughty Dog smeared all over them, until they feel like something completely **** entire production smells like a billion well-invested dollars. The environmental design is so alarmingly life-like that wandering through a fictional college campus devastated by the collapse of all civilization made me deeply nostalgic for my own time in college. The sound scape made me turn away from the monitor to check whether the steps came from the actual room I was in more than once. The score is dominated by guitar strums positively dripping with atmosphere. Crafting a molotov cocktail out of a bottle, a dish rag and some alcohol dregs doesn’t feel like getting a nice tool to finish off the next boss, it feels like pulling something desperate together with sweaty, shaking hands so that it just might rescue you from a gruesome, horrible death, the goddamn enemy design is that well done. The level design is completely devoid of artificial contrivances like chest-high walls and yet creates incredibly engaging encounters and an almost perfect sequence of action-packed peaks, tranquil troughs full of quietly tragic environmental storytelling and the very occasional funny bit that knows just when to cut the tension before it becomes traumatizing. It all adds up to this world feeling completely, effortlessly real. Into this boiling cauldron of excellence Neil Druckman then stirs the warmth and charisma of Troy Baker, the spunk and energy of Ashley Johnson, and his script. Baker and the script made Joel, who on paper is a pretty **** guy, a character I could actually understand and sympathize with. Ashley not only made a life-long fan out of me with her portrayal of Ellie, the story gave her a wonderful, uplifting, compelling character arc. All future teen sidekicks will forever fail to live up to Ellie’s legacy. And then the script. It turned me into a blubbering, tearful mess, made me scream in rage for all the right reasons, shocked me into stunned silence and finally left me in that kind of thoughtful, lingering sadness that only really good, complex depression media can engender. The kind that makes you hit play again immediately after experiencing its ending. I have only one substantial criticism: At times the player is free to hurt his own immersion through gameplay decisions. It happened to me once and pulled me out of the experience for a bit. Also, crafting an entire comic series to explore and then not letting the player read more than the blurb is anything but fair. But that’s all I have, really. So I raise my tiny voice in the overwhelming chorus of LoU1-Fans and declare that for me, this game is a 10/10. TLDR: The Last Of Us Part 1 defines “Putting an unbelievable amount of energy into appearing effortlessly perfect”, and then it keeps you up multiple nights with the incredible stories it has to tell. DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS GAME!. Boring Story, bad german syncro, Bad Characters, Bad Gameplay, Only Cutscenes too less gameplay. Nothing makes this game special. The best way to experience The Last Of Us, what a great game and what a great remake.. My favourite game of all time undoubtedly one of the best games of all time, the linear gameplay makes it feel like a movie but the level design still feels open. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best game I played all catogeries. Graphics and story are top **** bad thing is that ""The Last of us Part I"" for PS% makes every other game seem dull and bad.. A very fascinating experience of a remake. I think it was a very good remake.. I have never played original or its remaster, so I can only judge this game as it is. There is a lot of attention to detail and survival mechanics. The graphics are great, and the story is also good. But it’s not so good that I would replay it. Also I believe it’s just about worth the current price tag when it’s discounted on PS store.. The game looks gorgeous with the new graphics, it was never a game that looked bad, and for its time it was even more revolutionary yeah, but it still looks great even now compared to other games. But there arent that many changes, plus some new stuff like the animations make some stuff more harder and less responsive than before. Fighting the bloater was way harder than I remembered and i even died multiple times. Shockingly good on every level. Not a single wasted pixel or mechanic. Everything contributes to the brutal world and unforgiving story. Bookended by fantastic twists. Iconic performances. It's hard to think **** that succeeds more at what it tries to do than this one.. Solid remake but performance issues were a problem for a while at least they fixed it though. TLOU will always be a great game and a solid 10 to my heart. But i will base this review is for this ""Remaster/Remake"" segment only. At least that is what i was told it was.. a Rebuild of the original. Was hoping for something completely re-done. New cut scenes, new camera angle, new features and so on. But the game is just a re-skin with new shiny graphics. Feels like a simple remaster than anything. I am sure the graphical part is well improved and enhanced for modern systems, but i do not notice it.. it is still the same game scene by scene as the original and offer very little new. absolutely not $80 worth.. The game is amazing. Having played on all PS genetations I would difenetelly say, it is the most fascinating game I have ever played. Had a small concern about part 2, but both games are worth to be addicted from. Bravo!. Graphics 9/10 - Stunning visuals, only nitpick is water reflections. Story 8/10 - Cookie cutter zombie plot, some good characters, some bad Gameplay 6/10 - Joel moves like an old man because he is. The stealth is way too slow so be enjoyable. Overall 7/10 - Basic Sony story game, filled with puzzles, climbing and combat, the story isn't too long so it doesn't drag. There are many great video games like the RDR, GOW and the ghost of tsushima but the only best game of all time is ""TLOU"". Great story with a great cast of characters. One of the best graphical games as a result of the remake which shows of the capability of the PS5 hardware.. The greatest zombie game ever made, now with graphics and gameplay to bring it into the current generation. The best parts of the PS3 original merged with the best parts of Part II.. One of the best games I've ever played. The narrative and atmosphere are excellent and I really enjoyed the gameplay as well. This game grabbed me and didn't let go until I finished it, games like this make me play games.. It was perfect, perfect, everything, down to the last minute details Great story, gameplay, OST, graphics and characters. story mod in This game very good. I played it via Playstation Now in the cloud. I'm absolutely thrilled with the story. The characters have a sensational charisma, the story is very exciting and the gameplay is really good.. As the PS3 Original, The Last of Us Part 1 Remake is one of the best story games ever made. The Emotions they put into the dialogues are captivating and don't want to make you stop playing the game. The Graphics are also one of the best I ever saw. There are also several accessibility options that allow even people with disabilities to fully immerse themselves in the game. All in all a must-play title for the PS5 and a deserved 10/10.. One of the most gripping stories and best games ever created. I haven't played the remaster yet. In the original last of us, my only complaint was that even on the hardest mode I was still too overpowered with even a brick in my hand. I could just run and smash people. Then the clicker sneaking section was damn near impossible. I didn't move and crawled for hours. and they still found me. that was on grounded difficulty or whatever the hardest was. i gave up at that part and never completed the hard difficulty.gameis still great. near perfect.. This game has the best story I have ever seen. Each character has their own style of being. The game is filled with emotions making you want to play. The remake of this game is simply a masterpiece!!! The graphics became like in the second part, the character models were changed and modifiers were added that I really wanted to see in the first part, I think that the remake of this game was not deservedly underestimated. Incredible game! (Masterpiece) | The Last of Us Part 1 | 100 Points (5 Stars) | Story 10P | Side Story 10P | Gameplay and Animation 10P | Graphics and Resolution 10P | Dialogue 10P | Narrative Design 10P | Character Design 10P | Species Design 10P | Dynamic and Variation 10P | Bugs and Glitches 10P. I love the way they fixed this game but at the same time remastering a game that has already been remastered makes no sense and shows it is basically a cash grab. Story =2 Narrative of the story =2 Characterizations =2 Gameplay =2 Graphic =2 Result => 10/10. One of the best games ever from sony. Loved everything about it and now you can play it in even better edition. Can't say the same about the sequel.. The story is great although sad. The combat mechanics are fun and easy to use not something overcomplicated. The characters are perfectly created and the graphics are great. Naughty dog did a perfect remaster of the game 10 years later then the originals release and my experience overall was great.. The Last of Us is a landmark in video game storytelling and design. Its compelling narrative, well-developed characters, and atmospheric world combine to create an unforgettable experience. Despite some linearity and repetitive elements, the game's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The emotional journey of Joel and Ellie is one that resonates deeply, making The Last of Us a must-play for fans of narrative-driven games. It stands as a testament to the power of video games as a medium for storytelling, offering an experience that lingers long after the credits roll.. Fluent gameplay, amazing graphics and heart breaking story. They blow their mind on every single little details.. It was already one of the most emotive games of all time but this remake truly brings it up to date.. First time replaying since I first played the original and wow, forgot how amazing this is.. Unnecessary remake, barely any additions, preposterous price. All external issues aside, the game itself is fantastic.. the best post apocalyptic game ever existed, with one of the best graphics today. Pc port is trash and the game itself isnt even good. After you download it, you have to wait for the shadows to download, and while downloading, it uses %100 of your cpu and gpu (I have a 4070).. I've just logged in to say BIG THANK YOU !!! to Noughty Dog for making this AMAZING remake. It's a 10/10, it's a jaw dropping expierence. I've played it on ps3 couple of times, also on ps4, than ps4pro and to be perfectly honest, i buyed ps5 mostly for making a shot at this remake. It was 10/10 when it had its premiere on ps3, but now, years later, its been PERFECTED in extraordinary way. Changes are HUGE. It feels technicaly like its PART II. These are two best games out there - the first chapter and sequel (+Left Behind). THANK YOU ND ! You are the best. What a journey !. GREAT GAME EZ 10/10 for me love the visuals and everything abiout this unique experience. The Last of Us Part 1: A Masterpiece of Storytelling and Emotion The Last of Us Part 1 stands as a towering achievement in the world of video games, blending masterful storytelling, emotionally resonant characters, and breathtaking visuals to create an unforgettable experience. From the moment the game begins, it grips you with its intense and heartbreaking prologue, setting the stage for a journey that is as harrowing as it is beautiful. Narrative Excellence The narrative is the heart and soul of *The Last of Us Part 1*. It follows Joel, a weary and hardened survivor of a post-apocalyptic world, and Ellie, a young girl who may hold the key to humanity's survival. Their relationship evolves naturally and believably, filled with moments of tenderness, tension, and profound depth. The writing is exceptional, with dialogue that feels genuine and characters that are richly developed. This is not just a story about survival, but about the bonds that form in the face of overwhelming adversity. Stunning Visuals and Atmosphere Visually, the game is a marvel. The environments are meticulously crafted, from the decaying urban landscapes overrun by nature to the eerie, claustrophobic interiors that hide unseen dangers. The attention to detail immerses players in a world that feels both real and hauntingly beautiful. The use of lighting and sound further enhances the atmosphere, creating a sense of dread and suspense that permeates every moment. Gameplay Mechanics The gameplay mechanics are equally impressive. The combat is tense and strategic, requiring players to carefully manage resources and choose between stealth or direct confrontation. The AI of both enemies and allies is sophisticated, providing challenging and dynamic encounters. The crafting system adds another layer of strategy, as players must scavenge for materials and make critical decisions about how to use them. Emotional Impact What truly sets *The Last of Us Part 1* apart is its emotional impact. The game does not shy away from difficult themes and moments of profound sadness. It explores the complexities of human nature and the lengths people will go to protect those they love. The performances by the voice actors, particularly Troy Baker as Joel and Ashley Johnson as Ellie, are nothing short of phenomenal. Their performances breathe life into the characters, making their struggles and triumphs all the more affecting. Conclusion The Last of Us Part 1 is more than just a game; it is an experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. It is a testament to the power of interactive storytelling, demonstrating how video games can evoke deep emotions and tell stories that rival those of any other medium. For anyone who appreciates a gripping narrative, complex characters, and immersive gameplay, The Last of Us Part 1 is an absolute must-play. It is a masterpiece that will be remembered and cherished for years to come. --- This review aims to highlight the game's strengths and articulate why it is held in such high regard.. I heard this was one of the best games of all time- the game was very linear, which i personally don’t like, but i could understand why other people would like it. Definitely a must play but i probably won’t play it again/ platinum.. This game is absolutely incredible. The narrative aspect, story telling, world design and graphics are amongst the best I've ever seen. Everything feels like it had a lot of passion and thought put into it and I value that highly. The entire game feels like a work of art and I'm extremely glad I had the pleasure to experience such a gem. The gameplay aspect on the other hand, it's not the best. It feels really slow and clunky and can make fights extremely frustrating and not fun. Gladly the rest of the game overshadows those issues and makes up for quite an immerse gaming experience overall. The gameplay alone is the only reason I ain't giving it a solid 10 because this game is very near to being a masterpiece, for me. Probably tied with RDR2 as one of the best games I've ever played. I also got TLOU Part II Remastered and I'ma be playing that next. Can't wait.. While Last of Us is mostly praised for its realistic story that grabs you from the very first moments, I honestly expected a bit more in terms of gameplay. Corridors starts to get repetitive, although the graphics and flow of the whole game are beautiful. I cannot imagine that the game is technically much better than the PS5 remake. Maybe in terms of immersion.I'm actually not sure if I like or hate the movement in Last of Us. Joel feels heavy and slow, which is a bit of a pain when you're trying to search for valuables. On the other hand, it does feel realistic.What I definitely don't like is the way the game manages ammo. This is particularly noticeable when playing as Ellie. Every enemy shoots at you endlessly, but when you kill them, they don't have a single bullet left. I understand that the designers are trying to balance the survival experience when you don't have enough resources, but it really breaks the immersion and reminds you that you're just playing a game.What I like is the pacing of the story. It doesn't tell you more than it needs to, but the more time you spend with Joel and Ellie, the more you care about them. Especially the chapter where you explore the abandoned lab in Colorado is a masterful lesson in creating suspense. And the way the narrator reminds you of the beginning of the game at the end, when Joel holds Ellie in his arms, is truly **** Last of Us is truly an experience like no other, but I honestly expected something more. I was surprised at how dark, realistic and perhaps even depressing the story actually is. As with any progress, there's less and less hope. I didn't really like the abrupt ending, it could have been played out over a longer period of time to make it more **** gameplay is good and fun, but compared to the story it's even more predictable, and to be honest there's not really a point where you'd say ""wow, what a surprisingly clever idea"". What I missed the most is some kind of freedom of decisions. I understand that the story is linear but I wanted to matter at least a bit, not just following the beats exactly step by step.. This is a legendary classic that everyone needs to play, it's a fun yet depressing adventure, and a truly unique videogame experience. I don't like Post Apocalyptic Survival games but The Last of Us is something more than that. Joel is one of the most complex protagonists I've ever seen, sometimes his actions are villainous and selfish but he's so well written, you can definitely see where he's coming from, his loss impacts the story a lot and you feel his pain throughout the whole game. Ellie on the other hand, is the perfect deuteragonist, she is a deep character with a tragic past but she's represented as sweet, happy and quirky, which shows that she is still a kid after all. In terms of gameplay, she never gets in your way and helps in combat as much as she can. The story itself is pretty simple on paper but it's very well written, and the pacing is absolutely perfect. Now for the negatives, the game is very linear, and the secondary characters are forgettable. That being said, despite some minor flaws, I think that this game is absolutely timeless and definitely deserves to be in PlayStation's Hall of Fame. Final Rating: ""Amazing"" ~ 9/10.. Played it on the PS3 a **** time ago it was a good game..... . .. ...... ... The Last of Us stands as a pinnacle of gaming excellence, earning its perfect 10/10 rating through its gripping narrative, immersive world, and unforgettable characters.. A huge statement against all the cheap zombie-killing media there is. Such a deep story that connects players to the characters and makes you empathize with them. While the graphics are okay (there is not much difference in this version with the PS3 version), what lowers the score from 10 is the repetitive traversal tasks that are spread everywhere throughout the journey. It just starts bugging me when I am carrying the same ladder or trash container next to a wall to pass through it for the 10th time in my playthrough. For a person that sadly never experienced The Last of Us on PS3 and PS4, It was worth every penny, one of the best games ever.. Take the original game, with its iconic characters, gripping story and already gorgeous visual; add to them next-gen visual, 4k graphics and you'll get the PERFECT game.. Amazing gameplay, story, setting etc. Vert cinematic and feels like i was playing a movie. One of the best, linear, story focused game I've ever played, with plenty of action sequences, in terms of stealth, precision aiming, and also every now and then, a basic hand to hand.. Masterpiece. 10/10 outstanding story. Level of detail. Character development. One of the best games of all time hands down. Why do the characters get slightly uglier with every new version? At least the environments have a lot more detail.. they probably would look a lot better but unfortunately they washed out the lighting. I guess Naughty Dog doesn't have any real play but to sell you the same junk over and over, since they clearly aren't interested in hiring competent writers to make their developers efforts worthwhile.. An absolute classic. The plot is one of the top 5 plots gaming has to offer. The proformences by Troy baker and Ashley Johnson are second to none the facial capture in this PS5 Remaster is breathtaking.. Quite a pricey remake but I love having TLOU on the TLOU Part II engine. It allows for seamlessness.. This is not a remake. This is a graphics update. no new changes to level designs or story. No new cutscenes or major improvements to gameplay. This series has too many remakes and remasters. TLOU remaster still looks great and has more content than TLOU part 1. Unnecessary “remake” and not a very good one at that.. This franchise have more remasters/remakes than original games, this is ridiculous LMAO Can't wait for TLOU Part 1 remaster remake, and TLOU Part 2 remake remaster. Part 1 is really amazing, truly one of the best games. The gameplay starts to be boring after a while, but the action, the sneaking, the looting, the story is brilliant.. The Last of Us Part I is an amazing game with a great story, nice graphics and AI. The gameplay starts to be boring after the 2 hours, of walking, snea","a remake of the classic 3-d video game has been released for the ps5 . it's an incredible game, but the price does not justify the pros . it's the most intuitive (by also keep complexity) game i've ever played . the stunning graphics, enhanced environments, and revamped character models ."
5.Super Mario Galaxy 2,"[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Just more top quality Mario Galaxy. There are a ton of new and creative ideas that don't overstay their welcome. It's better than its predecessor in every way. I would still recommend the original Mario Galaxy for unknown reasons. (probably biased). Pretty close to topping the first game but comparing it to the first game wouldn't serve it justice. Good galaxies, good music, Yoshi existing is a pretty big addition. The smaller galaxies are the main reason this is a 9 instead of a ten nothing against it just I don't like it as much in my opinion. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A perfect complement to the original game content. The new gameplay with Yoshi really adds something new and level design continue to be a master peace.. Incredible, Amazing, wonderful! The perfect follow up to a perfect game honestly I could just listen to the ost and have a great time.. First Game is better but still this game is peak wii nostalgia and is my childhood. Better than first one. Best 3D platformer of all time. Nothing more to say. PLAY THIS GAME, IT IS PEAK.. Absolute cinema Every single level is a unique experience I had so much fun in more than 100hours Every level has his own identity and prankster stars make them even better. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game feels like a massive add-on to the first galaxy game. And frankly, that's all it ever needed to be, and all it ever will need to be. Mario galaxy is already a perfect game, and this game just adds onto it with even more content. Playing both of them leaves me dying for a third game. If you haven't played either, then i beg you to go get them.. I love this game cause everything in this game is excelente and his soundtrack is perfect better than the first. I first played Super Mario Galaxy 2 when I was a kid, soon after playing the first game. I had loved the first, and to no surprise, I loved this game too. From a gameplay perspective, it was much more fun than the first. Story-wise, it lacked what the original had. To me when I first played it as a younger child of myself, I didn't care too much about the story as all I wanted was a fun game, but replaying found it missed the mark. I also missed the comet observatory style select style with the domes, but the more iconic world map system still fit. Though I miss some of the original charm, this is a great game for 3D Mario fans or Mario fans in general.. The sequel to one of the greatest games of all time still holds up well. From Yoshi (also my previous Cat's name, miss ya buddy) as a riding buddy to the new powerups, the new stuff this game brought really enhances the experience. I do prefer the original game by the tiniest of margins, but that's not to say this didn't upgrade on anything from the past. Mario's platforming adventures and callbacks to previous games will never get old, and this game is pure proof of such.. They removed ur mr gay, but added yoshi coincidence? I THINK NOT!!!!!!!!!!!. I dont remember a lot since I played this when I was a child but I can guarantee myself that I had fun.. BEST MARIO 3D GAME EVER !!! A lot of content (120 stars + 120 green stars + the Grand Master Galaxy = 242 stars) High quality graphics (if there is a HD remake, it will be beautiful). Not quite as good as Galaxy but still a great game. While the level design and gameplay are a tiny bit better the music and story fall quite short of its predecessor. this videogame improve an already perfect videogame. What can i say, a truly masterpiece.. Just like the first game, it’s very fun and the addition of Yoshi makes this game amazing. Galaxy 2 deserves a place in every Wii library. It’s solid in length, while offering plenty more to return to later, and with one of the greatest orchestral soundtracks the industry has ever produced. A worthy successor to one of the greatest platformers of all time.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Perfect follow-up. The only downside is the spaceship that acts like the hub is a bit less exciting than the first game but that is a nitpick. The gameplay is refined and expanded. A masterpiece.. Behold the best video game ever made. ""But how? Its just more levels for the original Super Mario Galaxy. How could you possibly top that?"". But yes, they did the impossible. Best level design i have ever seen in a game, alongside equally incridible gameplay mechanics. The sequel lacks the emotinal beats of the first game and the multiplayer is still weak (but also heavilly improved from the original). However, people don´t play Mario for the plot. They play for the gameplay, wich is a work of art. Galaxy 2 also improves my biggest issue with the first one, which is the post game.. The pinnacle of video games, Its doesn't get better than this. The galaxy 3 hopeium will never run out. Im not delusional at all, no sir, not even a little bit.. It's no flawless game (it gets a point docked for leaving me stuck at one segment for years), but it brought me more fun than most games on the Wii. I had a lot of fun playing this when I was younger, and I still have lots of respect for it!. In my eyes, the only game to rival Mario Galaxy when it comes to its creativity and confidence. Both Galaxy titles have given me uncountable amounts of happy memories, and honestly, most come from this one. The levels and worlds you explore feel like such a beautiful continuation of what the original had started, introducing mechanics and ideas I can't imagine the Galaxy games without. From a gameplay standpoint, Galaxy 2 has everything its predecessor has, and then some, and it's downright magical to witness. However, I still think I personally prefer the original Galaxy for one major reason. For me, the tone and energy Galaxy 1 carried stands out to me so much more than Galaxy 2, which is far more traditional for the Mario series. It's a lot more upbeat and jolly, which fits Mario as a franchise perfectly, but the awe I hold for the kind of story Mario Galaxy chose to tell just isn't really there in its sequel. Again though, it was not a poor decision in the slightest. The story that is in Galaxy 2 is more than enough to carry me to its end year after year. This is still a phenomenal game all these years later. If you enjoy platformers and somehow haven't given these games a shot, please do. You won't regret it.. The gameplay of the game is very good. You have a very enjoyable time killing your enemies on small planets. The graphics are nice and cute according to the time. The story is bad (this is the only problem of all Super Mario games) that's why I give it 10/9. Mario Galaxy 1 is my favorite Mario game of all time. And Galaxy 2 makes a close 2nd. Take everything good about Mario Galaxy, and just expand it. Give it more levels, new mechanics, new story, but don’t take away what made the original special. That’s how this game is. Mario Galaxy 2 take the fun gravity and planets from the first game, so it mostly does feel like the first game with new levels. But once Yoshi comes in, you just can’t go back to the first Mario Galaxy. All jokes aside, it really just feels like the first Mario Galaxy with new levels, which is actually a good thing because the first one played so well. The epic music is back, the great visuals are back, and my boi Lubba got introduced. If you loved the first game, you’ll love this one as well. Another childhood masterpiece for me.. The first 3d mario game I have played and the best mario game for me. The improved gameplay fixed nearly every problem in smg1.. This game is way better than Super Mario ****, I know Rosalina was still annoying and The controls still bad, but this game is more fun and better than Mario Bad-axy, Thank you, Nintendo for making an secuel different and better undertanding how horrible Super Mario Galaxy is.. my favourite game ever. actual 9.9/10 just because it was such a great experience for me. While I definitely prefer the first game more for a fews reasons, the 2nd game is objectively better gameplay and gameplay variety wise but andid I could do in bwteen scores I would give the first game a 10 and galaxy 2 a 9.5. This game took what made the first one so good, and multiplied it (hence the 2 in the title). Adding Yoshi, new powerups, new and old galaxies, and the soundtrack is just as orgasm-worthy as ever! Both games can be interchangeable as to which is better. One day I'm feeling Galaxy 1, and another day I'm feeling this game.. My childhood game.. Just like the original, the sequel surpased the limitations of the wiiin all manners, the gravity of each planetdid not affect the other, the adition of more 123 stars to collect, the music and the mechanics, oh i remember the hype i had when i saw yoshi andhis own gamma of abilities. This game exudes a sense of vacation, a desire for adventure, and something that is distinctly Mario (especially in 3D Mario games). This game is one of the few I've played and completed with a family member (my cousin). My goodness, what great memories, a feast of gameplay and level design. It's not too long (around 20 hours), not too challenging (if I could finish it when I was 10, you should be able to as well), and incredibly entertaining. A fantastic game to play alone or with others. Great sequel, super universe and story, very cool new powers and maps.. Another masterpiece from Nintendo. So many new fun ideas were introduced in this sequel. In my opinion, the greatest 3D platformer ever developed.. Mechanically impressive, beautiful, the soundtrack is a banger, the level design is even better than the original, also it's quite challenging for a Mario game. So far, this game has been a constant stream of just highs with no lows, and it's one of the best games I've ever played.. They took the last game, right, and basically gutted it of it's somewhat beautiful story. In return, they gave us some of the more creative ideas and most fun gameplay alongside the astronomically insane soundtrack that was brought upon us in the last game. It is amazing in it's own way, and while it doesn't have anything similar to like, Rosalina's Storybook, it is still a perfect game in its own right.. 2nd best game of all time. Mario Galaxy 2 builds off the core mechanics of the original game to take the series to a new level. Increasing the challenge of levels, better designed levels, and adding Yoshi keeps this game as interesting as the first one. The quality of music is just as fantastic as the first game. Where this game stumbles is having a less engaging story than the first, a weaker hub world, and a boring level selection system. Other than that, this game does the job it needs to and lives of to the quality of the first.. Excellent 3d platformer game. A true masterpiece, it has great level design, great gameplay and controls, and it has a good variety of different level designs. One galaxy you could be in a relatively normal looking place but there are some very abstract and unusual ones, this variety makes all of them memorable.. bro this game i played it like i was 6 years. it's the last mario game i've played i even played super paper mario before but mario galaxy is built different i can't forgetmy memories with the 1st an 2nd mario galaxy. best mario game ever made, this game has good bosses, soundtrack and levels.. Super Mario Galaxy 2 was a great evolution from Galaxy 1. The new mechanics are fantastic (playing with Yoshi is a lot of fun), the level design of the stages is improved, the new power-ups are creative, and the soundtrack is incredible! A fantastic game.. Inventive, varied, unique and above all fun platformer that easily ranks as one of the best games on the Wii.. **** red dead redemption 1, this game is a masterpiece. It can be difficult to have a sequel live up to the hype of the original, but Galaxy 2 was able to push everything even further.. This is a really good game with ever better gameplay features than the first Galaxy, but it lacks the magic of the original.. I had never enjoyed a Mario game this much before, and the main reason for that is the game's planets. The planets in the game are designed so uniquely and beautifully that they practically beckon you to explore them. This situation greatly rejuvenates your motivation to complete the game. Furthermore, the mini-boss and boss battles in the game have been thought out well and feature quite enjoyable mechanics. In short, it's a game you should experience.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Super Mario Galaxy 2 is my favorite game of all time. Is it the objectively best game of all time? Probably not, that title probably goes to Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. But Galaxy 2 is still absolutely amazing. Music is 10/10, gameplay is 8/10. The only thing that's lacking is the story, but the music and gameplay makes up for it.. the best mario game ever every level in this game is amazing replayable and unique. This game is a step up from galaxy 1. I know the story is almost the same but who cares about that? There are way better levels in this game and was way funner than galaxy 1. Im about to 100% it but i cant beat perfect run, its just so hard and i love it. There are a lot of cool power ups, World map and more!. Mario galaxy 2 is more than a game to me. As a game, it is phenomenal. The music and atmosphere of SMG1 doubled down on, and just refined like a rich oil. (final boss, and the story is non-existent, but that was never really that much **** to me..) the only game I could say is better than this would be read dead 2, (its freaking read dead 2!!) I got to play this for the first time on my birthday when I was 4 without much **** on reality at the time. The countless hours watching my dad play this when he came home from work was a magical experience, and I will hopefully have the honor of doing the same for my kids in the future. Spending time with my dad while playing this really built our relationship, and I owe this game for alot. Thankyou.. Better. Mario. Galaxy. Wow, even when i come back to this game it's level design is super good. Nothing else to say, play this game.. This is easily my favorite game of all time and it remains to be. Super Mario Galaxy 2 has amazing level design from more linear movement so it isn't really a speedrunning masterpiece, but a platforming one overall. The music is also fantastic and the ideas and concepts with the powerups make every galaxy unique and outstanding, there is no filler, and there is so much time that can be applied to this game from the hundreds of stars in the game. Boss fights are also incredible as well, but I can go on for hours about the level design. The gameplay doesn't offer as many mechanics compared to all the other 3d mario games (ofc excluding galaxy 1) but this enhances the level design, so you can experience them with multiple items rather than rushing through the game, though it wouldn't be since people would still be mesmerized after looking at the galaxies. Still, mario's movement is still great overall. There really aren't any issues with this game that I found except that people could find it slow or long, but I enjoyed the experience the whole way through so it wasn't a problem to me.. Everything said about the first game applies to this one too, apart from the story which is waaaay better on the first one. I'll just say that I slighlty enjoyed this game more than the first one because it offered a pretty good challenge, some levels were really difficult. The post game is also way better on this one. This game is too much similar to its prequel. They only added some new transformations and Yoshi. The gameplay is really easy and the levels are too short, causing an useless train that is necessary for the least galaxy (it requested me one month only to complete that). So the game is a forced sequel of Mario Galaxy 1, even if there are some good ideas.. Super Mario Galaxy 2 is by far one of the best platformers ever made. No one could have imagined that a sequel could beat the original in every possible way. Don't get me wrong, the original Super Mario Galaxy was amazing, but this one is even better. If you like platformers, you need to try this game!. This was peak childhood. My favorite Mario game of all time. i think everyone should try it out. The atmosphere, levels and overall gameplay was very fun. A very good game. Colorfl graphics, characteristic of the super mario series. Gameplay is amazing. Controlls are fluid and precise. The game feels intuitive. Levels are varied and interesting.. While not as good as Super Mario Galaxy 1, it still manages to bring new things to the table while keeping it interesting. The levels are better than Mario Galaxy 1, but I would say that they are not quite as iconic. And the store of Rosalina makes it hard for Galaxy 2 to surpass.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I Remember playing this game a lot! From unique powerups, responsive controlla, good story and fun bossess its definetely One of the best games ever! Better than the og! 10/10 for sure!. What can I say other than its more of the masterpiece that is Mario Galaxy and it is glorious. I just wish Nintendo would make a 3rd Galaxy someday to quench my and many other galaxy fans thirst for walking around islands with luma in our hats to help.. One of the best 3D Platformer games to date. Levels are entertaining, music is great, gameplay is rich. Just a pure fun to play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game is a masterpiece. If you don’t think that, go see a doctor because this games does as much good as it’s predecessor. Simply Amazing, this game takes everything that the first One did good and adds even more great features, levels and power ups! One of my di favourite games ever, so much memories from my childhood and so much fun.. There's a lot that it improves from Galaxy 1, but overall this is basically just 'more super mario galaxy'. There are new ideas, new mechanics, new levels. Sometimes it exceeds the heights of its predecessor, but its not nearly as innovative as Galaxy 1 overall.. Super Mario Galaxy 1 was great but Galaxy 2, is a masterpiece. It improved on the issues the first game had, though I wish they didn't remove the hub world from the first. This is the best Mario game to date. There's tons of Easter eggs from previous Nintendo games that you can discover as well. The controls are as good as they were in the first and the galaxies are better. And graphically, this gam is great, even for a Wii exclusive. and for the first time since super Mario sunshine, this game actually has difficulty later on as you progress.. The first Mario Galaxy was really hard to improve, but with this second part you have the feeling that you are in the same magical place, and even that you are in a better adventure. The 2nd best Wii game after tloz twilight princess. Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 are some of the best videogames EVER. No Mario game can be compared to this. The mechanics, level design, characters and fun factor make these two of the best Wii games one can experience.. As the first game i've ever played for Mario, it was beautiful, the songs were a banger, the gameplay incredible. This is my favorite game of all time. i ain even gonna lie i would abandon my wife and kids to play this game ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ. Just as charming as the first game! Amazing planets and gameplay as a whole!. This game has a special place in my heart and always will, made my childhood perfect.. Love this game! Yoshi is in it. Best mario game ever buy it now. I got this game 2 years ago and i love it. graphics arent the greatest but its on the wii. I hope they port this too the switch. Uhhh... perfect much? Mario is an acrobatic wonder and at this point it's like he allows Bowser to steal Peach so he has an excuse to unleash his demon mode onto the entire universe. Mario glides from galaxy to galaxy, shot off from launch pads with his own personal orchestra unleashing their own inner demon modes. There are 49 different galaxies that are each remixed into 2-3 unique stages, and about 95% of them are virtually perfect. Truly the ultimate collect-a-thon. You have to wonder, who are these people that make these games? How? Are they even on this Earth? They just don't operate on the same level as us mere mortals.. Very fun and surprising easy to control despite the lack of a second joystick. Yoshi is very fun.. Worlds 1-5 are amazing! Some of the best levels the Mario franchise as to offer. However, some demon working at Nintendo decided to set the final boss number to 70 rather than 65, causing me to have to replay levels I had already played to find hidden stars. The best part of the game is Yoshi and I wish he was in more levels. It's a really great game, probably the best first party Wii game.. I do not think there is anything I can say about this game that has not been said, it is fantastic.. Pretty much the same game as Super Mario Galaxy! Slightly worse because of no overworld and barely any storyline.... Even better than the first best lifespan level design ya yoshi and we can finish the game without real challenge for those who are less experienced or have the choice to seek challenge in more complicated stars and in 100%. This game is so good level desing music game play Mario controls so great there is so much content i never found my self bored playing this game definitely my favorite game ever its amazing and if you havent you need to play it. Super Mario Galaxy 2 may not be the most original but it is a great fresh air to the plumber saga, with good mechanics and charming graphics.. This game is better than the first game. Some people may say the first game was harder but that's probably because they were younger back then. It took me longer to beat galaxy 2 than 1. Also some people like joshscorture may bring but that there's no space as well as it being easier to get 1ups . However, I recently played galaxy 1 and the 1up are also very easy to get and I do remember there being space in galaxy 2. Lastly there is space in the game and it's the first game to feature that final level if you know what I mean. With that out of the way I want to say that the levels are sometimes better than 1 as well as the levels being more plentiful. Lastly the multiplayer is better too as you couldn't do much with player 2 in galaxy 1. On it's own as a mario game, it's one of the best in the series. Yes it still has the spring power up which is not fun to use but everything else is great. It's got a good final boss, it has yoshi, it has great music, and it has a great cloud power up. It does everything right as a sequal.. I think this is one of the best game ever its really good that I don’t even have to explain.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Has to be the actual best Mario game in the millenium. This game was actually hard, and I had some really sour moments with this game. But that is why it is so good! This is the last Super Mario game on the Wii before they moved on to Gen 8 - a turning point for the franchise, just getting pointlessly easy. I know that this game was criticized for being too hard, but that gave them NO EXCUSE to lower it on later games while Kirby was only getting harder.. A fantastic expansion on one of the greatest games of all times, which is less atmospheric and faithful to the space theme, but contains a wider variety of levels, powerups, and challenges to complete after finishing the main game. This game would really benefit from a switch port, considering how well galaxy controlled on 3D All Stars.. great game most of my thoughts about it are the same for galaxy one I do thinks its a little better than one but its just a little shy from being a 10 still an incredible game and would recommend it to everyone. 9/10 (outstanding). Super mario galaxy 2 built on super mario galaxy in almost every way, controls, level design, more levels, YOSHI. The only ways that feel worse is the hud and the story but the amazing well designed levels and the infinite amount of joy and nostalgic i'm giving this a must play 10/10. This game is just Mario Galaxy but with more stuff. Its amazing to see the sequel that keeps on the quality of the first.. Super Mario Galaxy 2 takes Super Mario Galaxy 1 and expands upon it much better without taking away or changing anything that made the first game unique, while also adding much more stuff that still held the charm the first game had. Simply put, If you like Super Mario Galaxy 1, you will love Super Mario Galaxy 2 and in vise versa.. Probably the best 3D Mario game. I liked Galaxy, but Galaxy 2 just knocks it out of the park for me. The environments are great, the green stars are a fun addition to the end game, and the Perfect Run is a great way to test everything you've learned through the game.. Best Wii game and one of the best platformers in general. Can't recommend it enough if you have a Wii/Wii U.. The best Mario, undoubtedly my favorite, perfected what Mario Galaxy 1 had achieved and did it well.. This game is the perfect game. I’ve never seen any game this good. It’s so polished. The graphics, music, level design etc. is just out of this world.. Even though I prefer the first one and would rather see the first one get higher I just can’t rate this one any lower than 10. It's very close to getting a perfect score, but it just lacks the magic of the first game for me. It's still an incredible experience every Mario fan should play.. This game is so amazing, i never got bored. The galaxies are different and originals. It's def worth playing.. Mario Galaxy 2 is the best game on the Wii system . The game works very well with the Wii console for it’s time . I can see this game becoming a icon similar to Mario 64 and Mario 3 for its innovation and style.. This is the best game ever made the fist game i ever played i love this game with all my heart but even without nostogia this game is still amazing the story is pretty good baby luma is cool but the gameplay music and atomosphere is where this game truly shines mario is very agile with long jumps and each level being diffrent having a unique spin and the new mechnacis like the cloud flower and yoshi were just amazing mario galaxy 1 was a masterpiece but this game takes the best parts and makes them so much better and the motion controls are not bad btw. Good - the drill item is fun to use - yoshi is so fun to use. - the visual, level, obstacle, enemy, and platforming design was incredibly creative. - I like how the devs transitioned the pink moving platformers into 3D - star ball stages are fun - the platform flip using the spin attack was creative and fun. - leading bomb-omb to blow up the glass ball was creative - more creative gravity levels - instead of just collecting coins for a star. Galaxy 2 has you to collect stars then a new planet is born, where there’s a bit of extra gameplay for you to collect the star. Bad - I prefer the hub world in galaxy 1, cause it felt like a home, and going into different rooms to enter levels. The classic hub world layout in galaxy 2 feels too concrete and boring. - the game is brain dead easy. Only thing that kept me going through the levels was the amusing, creative platforming. And the unique level, enemy, and obstacle designs. - Where’s Rosalina? I connected a lot with her in the first game from her life story in her story book. Now she’s nowhere in galaxy 2?. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. For a 3D platformer, this is ground-breaking, gameplay mechanics are great, environment looks spectacular, and the level design is fantastic, but it gets a little bit repetitive after a while, and some boss fights are underwhelming.. Best game on Wii no doubt, you have to play galaxy 1 to get the full experience and vice versa tho.. it is simply a great game has a great soundtrack, a very good and entertaining gameplay and a lot of creativity behind each of the levels. It is a very good game and even if it does not have a very deep story or plot, I am almost sure you will have a great time and I know that I will be one of your favorites.. Not bad, but far, far from perfect. Around halfway or 2/3 through, the game gets a lot grindier than the previous half.. Just like the previous series, everything still feels beautiful, cool, charming, interesting, satisfying. Masterpiece games by nintendo. Amazing game. It's exactly like Mario Galaxy 1 but with different stages and some new power ups. It's a must play like it's predecessor.. Even thought it reuses some music from Galaxy 1, it often remixes others such as the background music in World S being a different version of Gusty Garden Galaxy, and it works amazingly! I sometimes hear people talk about how they dislike the linear world map which pretty much forces you to play every level as opposed to Galaxy 1 which gives you a few levels, and depending on how much stars you have, let’s you play whatever levels you like. I personally have no problem with the world map in Galaxy 2 as it works kind of the same way, you pick a level, pick a star (or find a secret one), then play. You have all the right to skip levels in some areas, but I guess I understand why people don’t like it. I have no problem with it as you sometimes have to play more of this amazing game, and while that doesn’t sound as fun, again, it makes up for it with the soundtrack and, in some cases, amazing level design and idea. Overall I feel like this game is amazingly BAD at being bad, seriously, really the only time I ever regretted playing this game was when I was playing “The Perfect Run”, which is entirely optional, I just wanted to 100% complete this game as I’ve had it for almost a decade, and I really recommend you do too!. This is a great game, but because of all the Mario games of that era, being Galaxy, 3D Land and 3D World, it just feels generic.. While the original Galaxy has a great sense of atmosphere Galaxy 2 has far better level design and replaces the weaker mechanics from the first game with better ones along with the amazing addition of Yoshi makes's this game a lot more fun. The levels are longer and either introduce new mechanics or polished up mechanics from the original game and expanded upon in what seems to be the best way possible. The smaller hub world is a lot more fun to explore as all the good stuff is a lot closer together and the addition of a simple ""world map"" to get from level to level makes the game flow a lot better.. Big childhood right here. I will probably never have so much fun as I had with this game, and I thank Nintendo for that!. Creativity: 19/20 Design: 50//50 Nostalgia : 29/30 Total: 98/100 best nintendo game in my opinion. My first videogame that I've completed and it's awesome! Music and variety of stages are top notch. Best Mario game.. This game is a blast. The game sets itself apart from its predecessor by focusing less on the story and more on deepening the gameplay. I feel like it is the right decision to focus more on gameplay than the story of it. Even in 2021 I have a blast playing it with great physics and even visuals that doesn't look half bad even with todays standards. And even though everything is so good up to this point the best is yet to come. The music. There is no such feeling as running around on a small and interesting planet while an epic orchestra is blasting and cheering you on. For every bombastic piece there is a quiet and more toned down ballad at some other point and it turns this game into a emotional rollercoaster - in a good way. This is the second greatest Mario game of all time, and it's basically a tie. Everything in this game is (still) perfect. The visuals, the music, YOSHI, it's just amazing.. You negative **** don't learn these days, do you? If you wanna hate on another game, go somewhere else.. With ","this game feels like a massive add-on to the first galaxy game . from a gameplay perspective, it was much more fun than the first . from a gameplay perspective, it was much more fun than the first ."
50.Portal 2,"a classic in the puzzle game genre and a brilliant co-op experience too. puzzles were hard enough to make you think, but not hard enough to infuriate you and make you quit or look for the solutions online.. If you like puzzle games its a must play i didnt like it beacuse it got boring.. Best puzzle game of all time. Valve always the goated gaming developer...... Perfection. Everything this game wanted to accomplish, it absolutely soared with. The puzzles, the humor, the story, the music. This game is absolutely perfect.. This is one of the best games I ever played, both from the gameplay and the story. This game has only 3 characters but they all rocked. The inclusion of lots of new mechanics make the game even more interesting to play. I definitly recommend playing it.. Now you're thinking with portals. From an amazing single player story to an exceptional coop experience, this game has it all. The puzzles are mind breaking and the cake is a lie.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. one of the best games I've played,not perfect, since a lot of instances needed a lot of thinking to proceed or I had to use a guide, but I swear you have to try it out. 9.5/10. It was a very good game with an interesting narrative, and I know I'm in the minority when I say this, but it doesn't quite feel like the critical acclaim everyone says it is. The gameplay loop just got kind of stale over time in my opinion, still very good though. Portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece. You can play it 10 times and still find little Easter eggs. It is the best sequel to a game. It has much lower lows than its predecessor, when you are out of the chambers and looking for a single pixel that you can portal. That, however, matters little in the grand scheme, as its highs are so incredibly high! The level design (in the chambers) is excellent, the story is amazing, the coop campaign is really cool and they gave you a level editor on top of it all! It's basicly three games in one: A sequel, a coop spinoff and a Mario Maker version!. The game is cool. But if the vestibular apparatus is weak, it gets tiring quickly. But worth the time spent. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. its perfect. portal 2 is just such an immaculate **** game its crazy.i have never played a game and been so genuinely stunned at how good it is. My first playthrough was marred by a large break between me playing halves of the game but the latter half of the game was so good I immediately replayed the whole game again for the full experience. I never played something like this. My all time favorite! Funny dialouge's and curiosity after every chamber about what will happen next is so interesting. You can finish it in one sitting. Glados please roast me more.. just a wonderful experience with a friend or solo making the 2 different stories very satisfying to complete.. One of the best games ever made. I love how the story is longer and richer.. very good though some puzzles i did have to look up a guide for generally bettter then portal 1 and the ending sceance is really cool. What could have just been another slate of excellent puzzles instead turns out to be a moving story that adds depth to the world and characters while introducing new wrinkles to the already great portal format.. This game is very good, like the previous one, I would also recommend it to anyone who has the opportunity, but I consider the previous game to be better. PC, Xbox 360 and PS3 are very similar so play whichever you have the opportunity to.. What a masterpiece. This game would still be acclaimed that much if it came out nowadays.. I think this game is excellent. It expands on the puzzles of the first game and has unique, if divisive, writing.. --NO SPOILERS INCLUDED-- Well, here we are again. The puzzles are a perfect difficulty, where they're hard enough that you can't just fling through them, but they aren't smash-my-keyboard hard. The storyline is interesting, with a whopping ten chapters, where some are more story/exploration based, while others are more puzzle based. The game is MUCH longer than Portal 1, offering more of everything. More puzzles, more story, more characters, more features. Portal 2 offers a co-op mode, where you play with another person. Each person has a pair of portals, and teamwork is required. There are also lots of mods, including: • Portal Stories: Mel • Aperture Tag • Portal Reloaded • Thinking With Time Machine And even more! Final verdict: An epic game, which you need to play.. Portal 2 is a awesome game, with a good and funny story combined with good puzzles, amazing caracters, and very optimized for old devices. boring + stupid mgame. worst siquel ever time bad game from valve **** shi. Masterpiece, the best or one of the best puzzles games of all time .. Portal 2 takes the original's beloved problem solving formula and injects an incredible story and atmosphere into it. Rich personality and a great sequel that improves on Portal in every single way.. Continues the fun and ingenuity of the original with more complex puzzles. A must-play for fans of the first game.. Absolutely amazing game. The story, while it might be a bit cheesy, has a lot of weight to it, and the mechanics and puzzles are quite enjoyable. There's also a test chamber creator which is amazing for the longevity of the game. A lot more games should have that.. its kinda bad with dark humor and plus its got on news because of wheatley joke about being adopted. Wow. Just wow. They did it again. A part of gaming history for good reason. Expands on the existing lore and has callbacks to the previous game. New mechanics that don't get old. It's pretty decent FPS puzzler, but many new mechanics feel tacked on. The first Portal game was tighter and more enjoyable.. It's bloody Portal 2, the best game of all time, the best gateway game, one of the funniest games ever, what sort of score do you expect?. Portal 2 is what every puzzle game wants to be. Every single puzzle is meticulously well crafted and is a legitimate joy to play. The narrative is strong and mysterious, and will keep you guessing as to what will happen next. The voice acting and writing is on par with Rockstar and Naughty Dog, making this one of the most well-written (and hilarious) games ever made. The returning GLaDOS is once again an amazing character, and the new robot Wheatley is also surprisingly well written. There is very little wrong with this game, bar some non-obvious exploration sections which take up a negligible part of the game. There is no bad puzzle or bad section, and the game is paced freakishly well. This game is absolutely timeless and will hold up as one of the best puzzle games of all time.. Portal can't be beat. Test chambers are some of the most unique puzzles ever made.. Portal 2. Back when VALVE was about games and not about money. Perfect gameplay, good graphics, awesome soundtrack, the community feature brings thousands of difficult and beautiful new levels, good coop. There is not one thing that could be improved.. the only bad quality of this game is the amount of loading screenes tbh. Portal 2 isn't just a puzzle game. It's a masterclass in worldbuilding, storytelling...everything. Replaying levels feels so smooth, and it's incredibly fun to just jump in and try to beat your speedrun times.. Portal 2 it's the BEST videogame what i played. The gameplay, the ending, the music, the characters, the atmosphere, the lore. EVERYTHING IS PERFECT! im waiting to the third game after years. VALVE you created a masterpiece. Only downside i have with this game is that parts of the maps just looked destroyed and I did not like that very much.. Ahhhh so cool. great charcters, story, puzzles, gameplay, straight up a great game. I still laugh every time Wheatly says ""Hacked!"". Best Game Ever. Including Map Editor. is very nice too. Community Maps are still being posted.. I played this game when I lost my brother and it really helped me go through. portal 2 is a good game but I don't think im going to play it that much cause i already beat it and i just don't think im replaying. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Following on from the end of the original game, you are reunited with the evil robot with a grudge who insists on making you jump through scientific hoops, this time without even the pretence of cake. A highly original first person puzzle game with an added storyline and wicked sense of humour that requires knowledge of trigonometry, gravity and momentum with a hefty dose of lateral thinking. Challenging and fun as well as rather unique.. Portal 2 takes what made the first game great and amplifies it by 10 fold. The puzzles are fun to try and figure out but never feel frustrating. If I'm stuck on a puzzle and I can't figure it out I feel like it's my fault rather then the devs creating stupid solutions. Also it is one of the best 2 player multiplayer experience ever.. love the multiplayer on this game very fun solving the puzzles with someone else.. Fun little short puzzle game by Valve with lots of charm and soul, especially great with co-op.. The biggest problem is that the first game was a puzzle game with humour elements and this Fields mostly like humour game with puzzles in it. One of the things that annoyed me if it is how much of the time you have to stand still and watch things happened that didn't really happen so much in the previous one, but haven a lot here. And the first quote of the game feels most like a repeat of the first one just with a much more talk villain that keeps calling you fat. but then there's something amazing you fill down to the bottom of the Earth and you meet The Legend the Lord ,,Cave Johnson. And you have to work together is the Nemesis and everything's becomes an amazing. This is where a game becomes it own and I feel like the Pulse is getting pounded again. latter half of the game keeps you on your toe and Storey just keeps getting warmed up and you have to play some really hard puzzle. It is so fun and I cannot recommend this game enough and the Co-op is the most fun you can have with your friend.. Great game strange puzzles but you'll get through it in the end once you are understanding the flow of how to navigate this strange futuristic World. Pew pew portal blast, honestly replaying this game was such a pleasant experience as I used to play it as a kid with my mum and we both adored it. Doing the little puzzles and what not, messing around with the portal. Now 11 years later looking at this game wow it had a bloody great story, with an amazing but small cast and there is so many mysteries to this day we don't know about and probably never will. This game was cool af.. A PORTAL TO THE FUTURE BEFORE WE BEGIN: I start with the premise that I have played everything Portal 2 has to offer; thus the singleplayer, online co-op, and challenge mode. In addition, I got the platinum and I studied its various secrets. WAKING UP: The game, depending on which mode you are playing in, immediately begins by projecting you inside this huge facility, The Aperture Science Inc., which, however, seems to have aged from the events of the first chapter, leaving you guessing at the time skip of several years. From the very first minutes, whether you play in single player or cooperative mode, the game explains how to use the basic mechanics of portals, immediately putting your personal portal gun in your hands. The initial differences between the two modes lie mainly in the extra mechanics that the cooperative mode possesses, namely those of the various pings that can be used to communicate between the two players. THROUGH THE PORTAL: The game visually is incredible and immortal; even played eleven years after its release, Portal 2's graphics and colors remain delicate and appreciable, regardless of which console you try it on. The use of the Source Engine, used in the very famous Half Life 2, makes the graphics, physics, and animations of this game not only at the top of those existing at the time, but still comparable to modern ones. The setting itself, though subjective, is also truly unique and fascinating. Nothing in this game is left to chance; lighting and colors are always used wisely by the game designers to give players a sense of what to do and when. WHEATLEY SAYS: The sound part of Portal 2, being a puzzle game anyway, does not claim to be sublime. In any case, Valve has decided to create multiple unique Osts that perfectly match the style of the area in which the player is moving or the cut-scene being watched. Huge credit goes to the voice actors who have given the robots unique personalities (Wheatley is perhaps one of the robots, in the video game market, with the most unique personality, perhaps comparable only to the legendary Cl4p-tp). IN THE TESTING CHAMBER: Portal's gameplay, on paper, is a simple puzzle game that takes advantage of the mechanics of two interconnected portals. The beauty of the gameplay, however, is how this mechanic has been used both within the areas expressly dedicated to puzzles and in the story areas in an extremely precise and dedicated way; it is almost impossible to solve puzzles in manners not intended by the developers, and trust me that if you think you have found a cheese, even that was probably designed by the developers precisely to give you that frenzy of completing a level in an unintended way, thus giving you the urge to continue solving levels. What really drives the player to continue the game is that feel-good feeling you get after figuring out how to solve a puzzle, as well as the obvious desire to find out more about the history of this mysterious company. Finally, a nod to the game's cooperative mode, designed to perfection to give the same feeling for two players. The experience has been made fun and not at all repetitive for players, as the cooperative levels are unique and much more complex than those found in the single-player mode. ACHIEVEMENTS: Portal's achievements are very simple and push the player to play almost everything it has to offer. The only flaw, in my opinion, is the achievement that requires you to complete the entire course 4 in co-op and without ever dying, which, compared to those that require you to complete some in speedrun, does not suit the puzzle genre as much as the platforming genre. In addition, there are as many as two achievements that require completing actions with multiple players online, limiting in the future or for those without the online subscription. BUT WHY 9? PROS: The pros of Portal 2 are countless and have been amply explained in the previous lines. Portal 2 is a game that borders on perfection, rarely encountering bugs or unintended things; the graphics, animations, and direction are almost immortal. The story, for a puzzle game, is compelling and not at all trivial. The game length is almost perfect for the style of the game. The variety of levels is excellent. In short, Portal 2, like almost all of Valve's work, is a timeless masterpiece that still propels us into the future of puzzle games. CONS: Finding cons for this game is very, very difficult. The only small things that do not make it a ten are the lack of a menu to select specific levels. Also, a totally personal choice by a game designer in first place, without spoilers(those who have seen will understand), I would have left the final phase of the game (The elevator) in the hands of the player, so that he can really feel the freedom. RATING Gameplay: 10 Music: 8 Story: 9 Co-op: 10 _. From the age of golden age gaming, where games were games and gamers were gamers. This is a game made with passion and creativity, not like the garbage churned out these days. It has charm, personality, and passion in spades. My only criticism is the puzzles get tiresome and too challenging and I wanted it to end around halfway, but the lovable Wheatley and co, make up for it easily.. This is my all time favorite video game. Everywhere and always. I'm shocked by the gigantism of these levels. I am amazed by the drama of the solo performances of the characters. Puzzles just got a little easier. But much more varied. And they added an amazing co-op to the game. And unlike the PC version, here you can play co-op on the same screen with a friend in the same room.. Valve doesn't miss. Portal 2 along with Portal are the best puzzles games in the history of gaming, and the second game maintains the very high standards of the original. Making a puzzle game is simple, but making a good puzzle game is actually quite hard, and developers almost never get it right. They either create puzzles that use bizarre Nintendo logic to figure out, or are just reskinned math problems, or require the players to find hidden secrets on the map, or worst of all, require knowledge that the player doesn't have. A good puzzle should be solvable with all the tools that the player KNOWS he has, and the elements of the map in the puzzle should be apparent, and not hidden requiring an element of luck for the player to discover it. A GREAT game puzzle is intuitive within the game world, and should ideally require knowing nothing at all when the player starts. The only puzzle in Portal 2 that broke these rules was the one with the white goo, which isn't explained. It's a pretty cool mechanic though, and discovering what it does was awesome. Oh, this game is also hilarious, and has a very engaging storyline that unfolds while playing.. Portal 2 is amazing sequel that takes what made the first game so good and expands upon it. Puzzles are more brain teasing with all sorts of new elements for the player to play around with. The story is more in-depth with more charters that are all a joy to listen to my favorite being J K Simmons character mid way through the game. And the inclusion of a co op mode is genius and is incredibly fun to play though with a friend. Honestly this game is amazing and a blast to revisit and while I do think its better then the first one in many ways I don't think I could pick a favorite. This one improves in many ways but there's something so charming about the original that allows me to pick that one up and play it whenever but regardless if you haven't already go play both Portal games. And hopefully someday we can get a proper sequel someday.. I've played it maybe a bit late in terms of time, but it made a lot of fun to play, sometimes I was stuck for way to long in one level, sometimes I just instant understood what to do and I always was sad about that. But it always was worth the time, because afterwards you can laugh, see stupid things and learn to love the game. It's one of my most favourite games of all time, but because of the play duration (And I'm really sad about that) could be a bit longer, maybe it's because there's no third part, I am only able to say 9/10. Atmosphere: 10 Enjoyment: 10 Gameplay: 9 Graphics: 9 Music: 6 Story: 9 Total: 8.83. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This game absolutely blew my mind the 1st time I played it. Its story, its characters and its game play were truly exceptional. Each level brings to the table new elements and witty dialogue that makes this game feel amazing. Has become the best game that I have ever played.. So great in so many aspects. The story, the puzzles, the multiplayer mode, the graphics, etc. I don't know why the multiplayer mode looks so much worse visually than the single player mode, though... And I kinda wish the multiplayer mode had more of a story. It is really good that they actually did design levels specifically for multiplayer and gave each player two portals. I bet a lot of games would've just given each player one portal and send them through the normal single player mode.. This is a perfect video game. the game play is extremely fun and innovative. The story is engaging and surprising.. OVERALL - 97% Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics (for time) - 8/10 Story - 9/10 Game Length - 7/10 Characters - 10/10 Level/Area Design - 8/10 Atmosphere - 8/10 Sound Effects - 8/10 Soundtrack - 6/10 Replay Value - 10/10 I wish there were more games like this. Massively creative and hilariously written.. This is no doubt the best game on the Xbox 360. It is fun for everyone, and a great place to start puzzle games.. J.K. Simmons and Stephen Merchant... Best. Casting. In. A. Videogame. Ever.. This game is simply amazing. A true masterpiece. If you are looking for something to be more than a great time, this game is way more than that, a true experience.. Portal 2 hosts some of the best comedy and the best puzzles in any game I've ever played.. A roller coaster ride of emotions. The literal embodiment of the greatest game of all time. This game always has and always will be my absolute favorite game. The amazing story and characters, along with great game play, music and animation, will always hold this game. No other game could ever hope to hold a candle to the Portal Series. No other actors could have played GLaDOS and Wheatley as perfectly as Ellen McLain and Steven Merchant. No game will ever be greater or even close to this. A true classic to be, and will be, played eons in the future.. The original Portal is an amazing game that had only one flaw, it wasn't that replayable. Portal 2 completely solves that problem with its expanded level design and newly added game mechanics, which make for one fantastic game. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The new map forge mode, makes it endlessly replayable, creating a whole new Portal community. Also with the newly added co-op, which is just as challenging and satisfying as the single-player, it gives you even more hours of entertainment. From the humour, to the level design and gameplay I do believe that Portal 2 is a perfect game.. The first thing I should mention before I dive into this rich creation is that if you have a choice between the PS3 or Xbox versions of this game, get the PS3 version. It runs, and looks a lot better on Sony's console. Now, to dive right into it. The graphical fidelity of Portal 2 is much higher quality than that of any of Valve's previous titles. This is because it runs on a heavily modified version of Valve's trademark Source engine, that adds a lot more detail and polish to the game's look. What is also great about Portal 2 is that it is a much longer game than the original, due to the much larger team, consisting of developers behind Left 4 Dead, Half-Life, Tag: The Power of Paint, and of course the original Narbacular Drop team. The game will take you around 5 or 6 hours to beat, much longer than Portal 1's short length. GLaDOS, Chell, and the iconic turrets all return from Portal 1, but a few more characters are thrown into the mix, making your playtime a lot more interesting. The story takes place a good few thousand years after the original Portal, Aperture is a dilapidated mess, and Chell, with the help of another character who I will not spoil, attempts to escape once again. Another thing I have to note is that Mike Morasky's score in this game is fantastic! Much better than Portal 1's admittedly mostly lackluster soundtrack. Now, on to the co op mode. It is very good. You can tell the developers put a lot of effort into making sure both players started thinking with portals and working as one. And GLaDOS's dialogue, in both the singleplayer and co op is hilarious, even better than in Portal 1. Overall, Portal 2 does a great job of expanding and fleshing out the innovative portal gameplay mechanic first introduced in Narbacular Drop back in 2005, while closing off the Portal storyline that began in 2007 in a satisfying, wholesome manner. I don't think that this game is better than Portal 1. There are things that Portal 1 does better than 2, and vice versa. I think that Portal 1 & 2 are equally good. And that's good enough for me.. Portal 2 is an incredibly clever and innovative game that far exceeded my expectations. Valve has really upped the ante with the franchise, and improved it in every way possible. It has a better story, characters, gameplay mechanics, sound design, and with the inclusion of co-op as the icing on the cake. All these aspects make this a worthy sequel to its predecessor. I absolutely love the hilarious and memorable dialogue between some of the characters; this breathes life into the game, creating an enriching experience. A must play!. I cannot begin to describe this game in a way anyone who hasn't played it would understand, so I'll simply say this; Portal 2 is the greatest puzzle game you will ever play. No other game will have you thinking as hard while laughing your ass off at the silly side character and insane plot. Truly one of my favourite gaming experiences and I'll not soon forget about it.. The game Portal 2 is a console game usually played on the XBOX 360, PS3, or PC. The game came out on April 18, 2011, although I’ve only been playing since Christmas of 2016, or a few months as I’m writing this. The console I will be reviewing on will be the XBOX 360, the XBOX version of Portal 2 currently is about $30, but most stores offer discounts. Some reasons it’s a good reason to play on the XBOX is the easy controls, the controls are very easy to use and can be remembered quickly. It is a puzzle game which is also quite short but usually takes a bit of time. After you do beat it you will have additional challenges to play, which I heard could also be quite frustrating. The puzzles can be great for brain development in almost everyone. This could also be a bad thing, if you aren’t patient this probably isn’t the game for you, or kids under the age of 10. I’m not done with the game because of the puzzles, but I am a pretty patient person so it doesn’t bother me. Although it is a puzzle solving game, it can be trickier than most. You go through each room with your portal gun, each room gets a bit trickier while trying to figure out where a cube goes, later it is a grey/white companion cube with a single heart on each side. Companion cubes help you to solve the puzzles by laying them on buttons that must have a weight to keep down. You also get the second portal gun pretty early in the game after you finish what I like to refer to as the “tutorial levels”. You aren’t playing the game alone though, the person helping you through the levels is an artificial intelligence names Wheatley. Later you get another one named GLaDOS which makes fun of you when you’re stuck on something. After you do beat the game you get rewarded with a prize and a song. Overall, Portal 2 is a great game to get your brain going. The puzzles you have to do mixed with the story line you get along with it. It took little to no time to start it up on the XBOX 360, although, I wouldn’t know for other platforms. Sometimes you do get stuck on something, but more than likely that just makes you want to beat the room more because of the story line that is provided. If you have a busy schedule this is a great game as well, you can save at any point and because it goes by rooms you could play one room at a time, although it does get pretty difficult and addicting.. Played through the solo campaign. Loved it. Great dismal story that's easy to follow and get immersed in. Very witty dialog. The puzzles do an excellent job of being tasking but not tedious. One of those games you just gotta play and beat because it's so unique.. Everything is perfect or nearly perfect. Graphics, story, humour, gameplay, soundtrack. This is one of the few games worth purchasing for every kind of player, even if you aren't normally attracted by this genre, you should give it a try. It is probably the best puzzle game ever made and one of the funniest co-op experiences.. Portal 2 Simpler and Better Portals single player has greatly improved since the original The single player mode felt much more fleshed out in terms of story to keep you going towards the end goal. Good or bad, Portal 2 takes a much simpler approach to level design this time around making this game much more casual friendly. I needed tons of help to get through the original portal, I only got stumped in portal 2 maybe 2 or 3 times total towards the end. Portal 2 is even more unpredictable than the original was, there are so many twists and turns with the story and levels that you have no idea where the end of one puzzle is going to take you. It was a great and much needed change of pace to go back and forth between testing rooms and half life style locations really kept the gameplay and story moving forward, making it almost impossible to put your controller down. There are a few added puzzle aspects such as light bridges, anti gravity beams, gels, and being able to redirect laser beams, but if im being honest these additions felt more gimmicky to me than innovative. if its not broke don’t fix it. I feel like the developers tried to cram too much into this game too fast. Portal 2 also features a co op mode, unfortunately though, at least on ps3, there seems to be issues connecting to steam so you are stuck playing local co op rather than online this isn’t an issue if you have friends. but as glados will tell you I don’t have any friends so I couldn’t effectively get through the 6 levels or get a true co op experience. I did however play back and forth through a couple of levels and love the challenge added of having to actually effectively work together with now 4 portals. Portal 2 is the same charming and addicting puzzle game as the original with still so much added to make it a much better overall experience. With the puzzle solving greatly dumbed down, and the characters still hilarious, and a very worthwhile ending, you owe it to yourself to run through this amazingly charming puzzle game. for what it is First Person Puzzle Platformer: 9.5/10 Overall: 9/10. Portal 2 is Portal 1, but better, the aesthetics do a great job of setting the mood, the humor is spot on with all of the jokes making me laugh, the gameplay, while the same, doesn't feel the same because of all the new puzzles, and the multiplayer is just as good with new and interesting puzzles.. Portal 2 is one of my most favourite games of all time. The story, presentation and gameplay are all fantastic! If you haven't already played this game. GET IT!. One of the best games I played in the last few years. For anyone who likes to solve puzzles and would like to try an experience of breaking with the physical boundaries of space. It's quite funny too.. Portal 2 is how i imagined it to be....a solid video game. portal 2 brings a unique gameplay to the table of first person shooters. Its a fun, time wasting game. Now portal 2 is not a game that i was addicted too and played for hours and hours, no portal 2 is a game that i played for an hour or two and then stopped. Why? well portal 2 to me was fun but not too fun get what I'm saying? Overall it is a game you cannot hate on. It has great dialogue (very funny), a solid concept, and involves alot of brain solving.. This is one the best non-violent games ever made. It is also the funniest. If you love Pixar movies, odds are you'll also love this game. Highly recommended.. Portal 2 is a puzzle privilege. It's challenging and entertaining simultaneously. The game is a nice escape from mainstream games and offers players a unique and rewarding experience.. An absolute treasure. This game had made me waste HOURS into. That's how great this game was. The story, characters, level design, and overall strategy was pulled off so well in this game. The game had some hard levels that were very fun to try and complete. This is a game I will most likely never forget and would die for a third game.. For those unfamiliar with this game: Basically, it's like a first person shooter -- except you solve puzzles, and instead **** that shoots bullets, you have a ""gun"" that shoots portals, either red or orange. In the game you are a lady who ","a classic in the puzzle game genre and a brilliant co-op experience too . everything this game wanted to accomplish, it absolutely soared with . the puzzles are mind breaking and the cake is a lie ."
501.NBA Street,Such a fun game and took NBA Jam and made it more And1 streetball. Characters were memorable as well.. Few sports games have been as addicting or fun as NBA Street. Pick 3 players and go 3on3 against other players. You can even create your own player.. The first game of it's kind in the PS2 and definitely the best. It is truly the first game that brings the old NBA jam feel to the modern age. Developers should try to create something similar and follow this as a good example.,the first game of it's kind in the PS2 and definitely the best . pick 3 players and go 3on3 against other players .
502.Top Spin,"As with many sports titles it lacks long term single-player appeal, and the long load times can frustrate, but the gameplay is good fun and has enough depth to reward those that take the time to learn its mechanics.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]","the gameplay is good fun and has enough depth to reward those that take the time to learn its mechanics . it lacks long term single-player appeal, and the long load times can frustrate ."
503.Railroad Tycoon II,"One of my most favourite strategic/economy games. For 1998 strategic game it has really good graphics. 8/10. Perfect business simulation with a great campaign, where you play the history of train business. Gameplay is great and complex. I like the financial part a lot and how to manipulate the stock market and how to focus on which part of the business to get the goal. Music is fitting very well.. Classic game from the twilight of PC strategy gaming in the 90's. The game is only complicated if you don't select difficulty options or don't play the early scenarios first. People comparing this game to modern games, simply don't get it and are ignoring the fun and interesting type of game that is ignored by the short attention span theater goers. Have fun and play something that can give you something to think about.. I spent a lot of time on RT2 and despite old graphics, it's better that RT3. That's because RT2 is more challenging than RT3. But still could me more demanding :D. This isn't the worst game I have ever played but it's on that it's on that list. I mean, i see why people gave this a high score and i get it, nostalgia. That's what it is, nostalgia. I for one am rating this based on the game itself. It's not what i'd consider a ""good"" game. It has pretty good graphics (for it's time) but that's about it. First of all, the controls, interface, and graphics style is extremely confusing. I can't even get through an entire game without getting a headache. Second, the narrator. This guy is so annoying that he will make you want to tear your ears off of your head, no kidding. Third, HORRIBLE menu screen The menu screen is absolutely horrible. It makes you want to throw up on your PC monitor. Everything is disorganized and will make you scratch your head thinking, ""Why Did I Buy This Game?"". This game is not horrible (for graphics and nostalgia reasons) but it is pretty bad. It's not one of those games you just go and pick up on steam, it's one of those games you should have bought in 1998 when it first came out.. If you are a student of logistics you will either really love or hate this game. For me the game is addictive. I'm almost fifty and enjoy a simple game that on the outside looks simple but is complex. This is a game where no-one is shot or killed. This simple game requires one to think about what they are doing and several (several) steps ahead. I like this game.. Well, it's not a 10 and a little better than an 8 but it's definitely NOT BETTER than the origional. The ai is paultry to the ai of the origional game in which I lost and have never lost a game of this. But, the game is colorful and I give it credit for EYE CANDY (boy am I sick of games getting good ratings because of eye candy RTW are you listening?) What makes this game too easy is that the ai just ignores the businesses and I can pick them up for a song easily and plow right ahead into the lead and never look back. It also doesn't build far and wide like the origional either. It basically is just there to ""block"" you if it can otherwise it has no strategy about it at all. Nothing to me will ever match the origional Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon game. I still play it to this day more than these other eye candy games. I love the ""cutthroat"" competition and the fluxuating unpredictable economy and the music. ;). Good strategy game. Fun and challenging even if you don't like trains. Even if you don't like trains it's fun. Trainssssssssssssss..................trains.....","classic game from the twilight of PC strategy gaming in the 90's . despite old graphics, RT2 is better than RT3 . narrator is so annoying that he will make you want to tear your ears off your head ."

Almost better than NBA Live in this game...","""My Player"" mode is one of the first times that ""my player"" mode was introduced that I could remember . it's almost better than NBA Live in this game ."
505.Burnout Paradise,"It is EXTREMELY fun to drive around like a maniac, but the only problem, and its a big one. the npc drivers are ANNOYING. you CANNOT turn them off AT ALL and if you're just driving around you immediately just get hit by a car that came out of nowhere, play the remake, it may be better.. I pretty exciting on search for a racing game with the only drawback being repetitive and less innovative gameplay after while the game play get a bit repetitive and you have to do these apps same stuff all over again but overall there is a lot of car collection and you can choose from a while range of cars and even bike in the ultimate box edition just make sure to download all the DlC for your gameplay. Not as good as ""Burnout 3"" or ""Burnout Revenge"", but pretty close. Criterion made this an open-world arcade racer and added plenty of post-launch content. While it's a very impressive creation, the game doesn't feel as thrilling as its predecessors. You can get lost and overwhelmed with all the maps and modes in single player. And then there's the online play. More importantly, the races aren't as challenging or as fresh as before. Overall, I would rate this with an 8.8 out of 10.. The Burnout series tries something different with a more sandbox-style approach and an attempt at greater realism. The graphics and physics are fantastic but its hampered by a poor navigation system that means you keep having to take your eye off the road, which combined with its far less forgiving collision detection means you spend a little too much time stuffed into the scenery. Still a great racer by any other standard, but not as much fun to play as the previous few Burnout games.. This was the first Xbox 360 game I ever owned. Being a big fan of the previous two entries, I couldn't wait to play it. The city featured in the game is a true marvel of level design. As good as ""Paradise"" was when it first released, Criterion Games constantly updated it with free content. Despite some familiar elements, I found it to a truly astounding arcade racer. Overall, I would rate this with an 8.8 out of 10.. For a game that is essentially just 'crash into your opponents in the most elaborate ways possible', Burnout Paradise somehow didn't get stale.. The best arcade racing game of all times. If only you could re-start races when you fail them it would be just perfect! Visually it's stunning. It's still better than many next-gen games graphically. Destructions are amazing. Handling is quite tight and there's lots of variety, both visually and in the handling to fit anyone's tastes.. Great game, horrible attempt at a burnout game. Burnout Paradise aims to make the burnout series open world, and remove linear tracks. In the process it changes what defines skill from racing ability to navigational ability, something I didn't take too easy. They also created a new game engine, which feels more clunky and realistic similar to that of a need for speed game. Burnout Paradise does however try to implement previous boosting methods of Burnout 2. Burnout Paradise is a beautiful looking game, has a great soundtrack and very well made map filled with shortcuts, however it fails to recreate the crash mode in the new open world, feels more like need for speed rather than Burnout and ruins the racing formula Burnout Revenge perfected by making the tracks routes on an open world map rather than specially designed tracks in different locations. Burnout Paradise is not a bad game, just a poor attempt at a Burnout Game.. Burnout Paradise,was for me personally,the most disappointing game of the 360/PS3 generation. The idea sounds great,mix Burnout with a open-world. The gameplay is still solid Burnout handling with big wrecks,but you have to drive back to race starts to restart,plus the fact that there is no Crash mode in the game,is a major disappointment. The graphics are good,and the framerate never hitches at a blazing 60 fps. The sound effects are good,with good engine and boost noises,but the soundtrack is AWFUL,by far the worst in the series. Overall,Burnout Paradise is a huge disappointment,and pretty much buried the franchise as a result.. I really, really love this game and was kind of disappointed when it ended. Even after having spent dozen of hours in it + the DLC. It's just a very memorable experience imo. The location (Paradise City) paired with the excellent soundtrack lead to a very carefree and happy atmosphere. The cars look and sound are very cool and get incredibly fast endgame. There's a lot to do in the open world besides the challenges (which offer racing or stunt rides i.e.), just like exploring and looking for various collectibles and big stunt ramps which will grant you unlockables. Overall it's just a really great experience and I can recommend playing this game up to this day. The graphics are still more than fine.. The best arcade racing game of all times. If only you could re-start races when you fail them it would be just perfect! Visually it's stunning. It's still better than many next-gen games graphically. Destructions are amazing. Handling is quite tight and there's lots of variety, both visually and in the handling to fit anyone's tastes.. It would have been a good game if they took the irritating crash cams out. They're not pretty, nobody likes them, they just stop me from playing the game. It doesn't handle jumps good, how the hell can my car be perfectly straight, when two of my wheels definetly went on the higher part of the ramp, and 4 of my wheels don't fit on it? You can't retry events easily, would it have been that hard to put a retry button in there. Annyoing piece of ****. In theory taking Burnout into an open world was a great idea and Paradise certainly gives gamers more freedom than ever in which to race and generally cause chaos. Unfortunately however this freedom comes at a price. Having to drive across the map to activate events very quickly becomes a chore and it is also very easy to take a wrong turning leaving you with no hope of winning, something that is even more frustrating thanks to the strange decision not to allow races to simply be restarted. There is certainly a lot to admire about Burnout Paradise, and some will get many hours of enjoyment from it, but for me the open world is more detrimental than beneficial.. After playing the original games on Ps2, I was so excited to try the new generation Burnout **** wow what a downgrade! And the problems aren't **** those few are so gigantic I just have no idea how they could have let it slip. For starters, this game is more open ended...which is so and so. The original games were just challenges that weren't on a big map and you had to choose them from a menu; in here, you have to go on parts on your own, which is both cool and frustrating since you have to go ""physically"" there. There are secrets and stuff, but this is ""NOT"" GTA and if they really wanted to put something like that, at least give us some more ""teleports"". Second, the cars now are splitted into categories, which means they'll gather more boost in different ways, and also means different type of cars for each categories (duh!), which was something also in the **** a way, because cars were restricted to the challenge. I don't think you'd wanna choose a truck into a speed race, and use a Formula 1 car in a crash challenge, so in the end the ""freedom"" of choosing is rather limited. But in reality, I could have passed all of this if it wasn't for the biggest flaw of **** race itself. Burnout is basically an arcade racing game with basically a lot of speed and **** they completely destroyed this by removing the holographic rails, which means you'll OFTEN, if not ALWAYS, lose position because of a bad way!!! That means you HAVE to actually look at the street and actually ""slow down"" in order to win a race (or do it all over again a thousands time, so you know the way). In a Burnout game, ""look at the street"" and ""slow down"" weren't ever a big deal because it was always about speed and avoiding/destroying cars, and possibly check the roads if you could. Evolution is unavoidable, but this is a flatout downgrade since it basically removes all of the arcade elements of Burnout. And I have no idea if they can be added somehow or not, but I literally ragequitted before then, because I just couldn't win any race! Probably I **** at this game, but I definitely didn't back on the PS2 Burnout (especially Revenge). And so, I suggest to pick any of the older Burnout Franchise instead of this and enjoy maybe I'm not exactly clear on this game since I literally hate most of racing games and only Burnout managed to keep me interesting. But, considering that Burnout was my most favourite because of how fun it is, it was so sad to see the new generation Burnout being such a downgrade from a full arcade racing game based on accidents, to a semi-simulation and free roaming hybrid. At least for me.. The modern-day equivalent of Paradise is a mix between NFS Most Wanted (2012) and DiRT Showdown. With unrealistic cars, variety in car classes, emphasis on free-roam and exploration, Burnout Paradise is possibly one of the best racing games to just hop on and hop off. You can play it for hours and hours, or just for a few minutes. It's very straightforward, and you feel you know the game right from the start. There are a lot of vehicles in the game, all of which do have distinct traits. For a game with such simplistic driving mechanics, it's remarkable how different each vehicle feels. And with a free update, there's even more content. The events include races, time trials, stunt runs and a takedown mode. The number of billboards and gates to smash through also give reason for free-roaming. The game is very fast-paced and intense, especially as the events don't have a set route with checkpoints just start & finish. The game is possibly the easiest pick-up-and play racing game available, and yet it's still exciting and satisfying. Indeed, the city has been well-designed to accommodate for all sorts of crazy stuff. There is very little wrong with this game to be honest. The graphics could have been much worse given that it's running on RenderWare, which was developed in the late 1990s. If you're looking for a hardcore driving experience this is the polar opposite. Paradise is a game for everyone, regardless of their experience or tastes. In a way, it's the more arcadey sister of NFS Undercover. The problem with this game isn't the lack of content there's plenty to see and do with good variety. It's just that despite all this, Paradise is still quite boring to play not engaging and not something you look forward to playing just a game to pass the time.. This game isnt even burnout its just some stupid **** that tries to be a game but isn't there arent many things good about this game and its too different then the other burnouts. This is different from the excellent burnout games that came before it. The change to the open city design is not fun. It ruins races, in my opinion. If you make one wrong turn, it could ruin a race. So rather than drive balls to the wall every second like in previous games, this one is all about going 75% so you don't miss your turns and don't waste your time in a race. That's not fun. You want to put me in a city with shortcuts? Fine. Just block off the unnecessary roads so I still have an opportunity to do something in each race. The open world objectives to complete with other drivers online can be fun, but only if everyone is on the same page, which is never the case. Some challenges require a lot of players to complete, and it's near impossible to get that many people willing to participate in whatever you want to do. So this means many of this games achievements are impossible. All in all this game just isn't fun to play. Sure, the mechanics are the same, and the sense of speed is exhilarating, but the open world is more frustrating than fun. I'll take a more linear, focused experience over this any day.. Criterion Games are back with another installment of the Burnout series, and it is certainly the best title yet. With gorgeous graphics and many new features, Burnout Paradise offers an incredible amount of replay value and will keep you entertained for many an hour. Whether you aim to complete all 350 online challenges, free-roam with your friends, enter ranked and player matches via Xbox Live, or just try and conquer hundreds of single player events and gain your coveted Burnout licence is up to you; but whatever you decide, I am sure you will have fun doing it. The game. Burnout Paradise was a brave move from Criterion. The familiar destruction-oriented gameplay in an open-world environment was fresh and innovative, but riddled with problems. For example, crash a few times and fall too far behind early in a race? You're given the option of riding out the event, or quitting and driving back to the starting line. A restart feature was present in the previous Burnout games, so why not this one? The progression is tedious and EXTREMELY repetitive. Complete x number of events to unlock the next stage of your license, before doing the same events again to achieve the next level, and so on. The game features some amazing graphics, and driving around in the mountains offers you some beautiful views. There's a ton of collectibles to find, and this adds a bit more substance to the free-roam gameplay. Overall, Burnout Paradise is a fun game, sure - but lacking the same level of finesse and polish as the previous titles.. If I have to listen to Paradise City by Guns N' Roses one more time......Burnout Paradise should be a great game. It has a lot of things going for it: addictive gameplay, an open world, different game modes. Unfortunately these aspects don't get to shine because of the clunky way the game was designed. Findings the kind of race you want is difficult and the map isn't much help. Making your own route to the objective is a good idea but is implemented poorly. The sign telling you which way to turn is hard to notice in an adrenaline fueled car-off with more crashes than the annual Crash Bandicoot convention that I just made up. With no running narrative, the only encouragement to keep playing is to upgrade your license. Somehow this does not set my shins alight with excitement. And that DJ is annoying.. This used to be a good game, i liked all of the previous series but after paradise i said goodbye to the series. Probably everyone did, considered the fact they're now doing Need for speed.. If you like burnout, you might not like paradise.. This is how i will point flaws: The good: Graphics. The bad: Everything else. Why: Ok first, this game is nothing like what the past games where. This one went all ""racing"" on us, instead of burnouts trademark crashes and takedowns. Second, while your driving, the game freezes at random spots so an imbred narrator can talk to you about the obvious. such as: ""jump the ramps for points!"". OK CAPTAIN OBVIOUS. This game is junk. I want my money back. Burnout 1-3 was good. The rest, nope. Did i mention the game is lifeless? Its so unreal its not even funny! So, you look into your car or others, and noone is there. Ghost car? And nobody walks on the street. This game is horrible.. I loved the old burnout series but then Criterion decided to go and make a need for speed clone instead of create another burnout 3 style game. The game in itself is not a bad game but they ruined the series for me taking it in this direction, hence the score from a disappointed former fan of the series.. This is a Good game with lots of adrenalin but It is don't have story and And I can't customize the cars BUT this is a very good game with a little miss.. It reminds me a bit of GTA except you don't have to bother feeding yourself or hopping from vehicle to vehicle on foot. Now you can just do the rooftop shuffle from the safety of your car! With dozens of fun little stunt spots, plenty of raced out toys to drive, hundreds of shortcuts & jumps, a time trial on every road, and a healthy variety of events (race & other)..there is enough to keep even the shortest of attention spans occupied. Plus, with an open map and no defined circuits, you're left planning your own race routes and improvising the path along the way...pure genius!. As a Burnout game, I WAS mildly disappointed with the lack of an explicit crash mode with the chained explosion effect of the previous games, overall, it's a gorgeous, well-designed, and fun game. Just taking a drive through the miles of the city's open roads is a nice experience, and the cars perform (and deform) as they should. Showtime can't completely fill Crash's shoes, but it does a damn good job trying, and online is a completely engrossing experience that can hook you for days. Overall, a spectacular game that Criterion should be proud of and maintain. Oh, hey, look, I'm not getting paid off by the company! I actually just like this game!. Oh my word, this is a frightfully exciting game, isn't it, chaps? I say. I'm afraid to say that being a distinguished gentleman in the twilight years of his life, and dare I say it, ""born with a silver spoon in his mouth"", I had yet to encounter one of these new fangled ""xbox 360"" devices, but I was cajoled into having a ""go"" by my great-grandson and I'll say it was jolly good fun indeed! Unfortunately the opportunity for learning to drive an automobile never presented itself to me in life, as I've always enjoyed the benefit of having a chauffeur, so it took an awfully long time to become acquainted with the steering wheel ""controller"", but gosh the automobiles in this game do travel at some fair speed, I should hasten to add! If I were to be so rude as to fault the game at all, I should point out that it did not appear to feature the Rolls Royce Silver Shadow, as I would very much have liked to see how the game designers would have portrayed the automobile that ferries me around in real life. However that is a triviality that barely warrants a mention. This game appears to be sterling stuff, and well deserved of the 10 that I have thus awarded to it. Good night.. This game is frustrating!All the other burnout games from the first one were incredible.Especially Burnout 3 and burnout revenge.I still will give this game a high score cause it is great but ea needs to fix the wrongs in this game.I still play burnout revenge because that game is a true example of perfection.I have to say that I like midnight club:Los Angeles better by a little bit.I give this game an 8.","""Burnout Revenge"" is an open-world arcade racer . the graphics and physics are fantastic but its hampered by a poor navigation system . it's a great racer by any standard, but not as thrilling as its predecessors ."
506.Asgard's Wrath,"One of the best Virtual Reality games, surely the best VR RPG! Great graphics for that time, combat is fun, epicness in every character's story. Half Life Alyx is an amazing game, but I had even better time with Asgard's Wrath!. Mediocre game. Story is forgettable. Graphics are fine. Combat is anoying on every diffculty level. For craft/upgrade stuff it is needed to grind. Play time is artificially lengthened by this grind. I've get my copy for free with Quest 3. Personaly I think it isnt worth more than 15$.. Can't skip long tedious tutorials, checkpoint sends you before the start of the tutorial.. Can't teleport like in any normal vr game????? Therefore this game is a motion sickness fest. Unplayable for most people. The hitboxes are so weird, you'll be missing your inventory pouch 50 percent of the time regardless of calibration. You will be given/need a million items but not enough space to store them??? Why does the game start so amazing yet become so tedious and boring? Some locations are dark on purpose to save on textures... Fix these problems and this is a 10/10 Otherwise unplayable.. Best VR RPG game I've played. Not sure how it compares to the sequel but this set the bar years ago.. No teleporting, not accessible for players suffering from motion sickness. Therefore, I can't play it.. don't listen to some people here who say a good VR game should have interactions and things that are possible on VR, no a good VR game dosent need that to be fun, for anyone who love RPG and norse mythology and dream to meet loki thor odin in VR this game is for you, the follower system is a lot of fun with all the different animals and their different character, you really feel like a norse god, i recommand this game for any VR user. Nothing about this game requires it to be VR. It just is for some reason. The gameplay contains minimal VR interactions or mechanics. The combat system is a joke with how simple it is and how massive hitboxes are. The rest of the game is a decent action adventure game that's nothing spectacular and if anything suffers from the oversimplifications or cumbersome mechanics introduced by making this game VR. This is the epitome of ""VR is a gimmick"" type games and it's not something should be applauded.. This game is fantastic. Terrible load times though... Tons of fun with some really great ideas and execution. This is the kind of game that I've been waiting for in VR.. Original review: A feast for the eyes which is running low on budget. The further you progress the more obvious it becomes. It's like a lot more was initially planned than we see. Chests are not quite rewarding, wasting a key to get a potion, wait what? Exploration is mostly worth it to only see new incredibly beautiful locations. Boss fights become shorter instead of the opposite, it's like epicness is slowly deflating with story progressing. Difficulty is poorly balanced. On medium difficulty you have to break the armor in order to kill your opponents, but on easy it's like the easiest of all easy? ""I can't carry anymore"" - is the most popular line you will hear in game. Why did they do that to us? Apparently wanted to be different even if it does not make any sense. Lacks feedback on weapon hit not only in battle but also with crates. You just wiggle through it and can't say for sure if it's a bug or a feature. Auto equip is annoying. I want to use Siri' rocket fist, but instead I am grabbing a sword on my hip which I didn't even equip. In other words, there was not enough testing and analyzing in development of gameplay After Alyx release Oculus exclusives look like a scam. AW is something carefully developed in the beginning and then maybe new deadlines or unexpected expenses or both killed it. Can be fun, if you are new to vr, true. But people who are new to vr should try Alyx first. For vr games as of today 8 out 10. For flat games it would be 6 out of 10. For fake promises, possibly fake reviews and broken rating counter on Oculus Store that makes AW rating appear higher than it actually is, it's 4 out of 10 at best. Why would one be annoyed with suboptimal exclusive experience? Because Oculus is mainly a gaming platform like Playstation or Nintendo. They have to preserve the reputation of their hardware and that's why if they are going to have exclusives, they have to support developers of these exclusives. Don't even get me started on Stormland. Edit: I didn't mention that the price felt outrageous to me. However, with time passing, memories of this game are still fresh and it was superfun and really immersive despite the drawbacks. For example after this game I played Witcher 3 for the first time just to compare(I don't like fantasy settings anyway and was never interested) and I already forgot my witcher experience. it's probably 9 out of 10 for 20 usd. The issue is my personal tbh, it's not like I don't have the money to pay 40 for games, it's just in my country steam and epic store sell games twice cheaper, so I am just not used to pay 40.. What an amazing game this is. It is fun, it is engaging, the VR just opens a new dimension in this genre. I hope this will lead the way to the future of gaming.. A truly great game for the VR, I would say it's my favorite. Great combat as you get to play as multiple characters and battle using new and different skills throughout so nothing is really repetative. As well the assistance of a companion gets you to solve puzzles and combat enemies using teamwork. The game adds challenge with the inclusion of puzzles to advance through the story and is never a dull moment!!. Stupid dirty RPG, best game for VR period. Get with the times. Skyrim mixed with God of War.. This is the first VR game that makes me feel sarisfied with the price. This game definitely is a must-have for any VR user.. This what VR was made for. Incredible combat mechanics, incredible graphics, nothing to complain about it.. Asgards Wrath feels so much like God of War in VR , this IS how you make a VR game. Combat seems simle at first but once you realize how it works you have quite a bit of options and fighting styles. Oh and the game is huge with an incredible soyndtrack. soundtrack.. The game looks great story looks fun game mechanics seems fun But the controls **** and arent VR I don't push the doors open they open as soon you clicked your trigger lots of triggers activated animations. Also cant climb a stair just click a stair and you're teleported :( also the fighting isn't really good when I hit an enemy horizontally I cut him in half vertically? How .. Lots of hype but not what I expected.. Great story, fantastic world building, even better VR interactions and gameplay. The swordfighting and throwing feels real enough. The graphics are mixed, between hyper detailed environments, and then poor engine setup (each individual leaf is crisp but no screen space reflections in the water?). And another negative is generally poor optimisation. For the size and detail of the world it shouldn't be both the largest and slowest loading game on my PC, but it somehow is.. The best VR game ever made, period. But I must remind you. If this game was a regular board game (D&D style with dice and all) it would have ****. I was about to set my review score accordingly to that fact (which would have been a 0, since that would have rendered the VR features completely useless) but I changed my mind in the last minute. It is therefore a 10 out of 10 for me because the VR experience in its current state is absolutely fantastic.. The first true AAA Action RPG VR game that can rival even non-VR games. The amount of polish and detail in this game stands out from most VR titles. Seriously loving it!. Diablo 3 in VR! Best game I've ever played in VR. I have over 85 games. This is what Skyrim was supposed to be, not some **** ass port. I'm only 20% through the game and itching to go back through again. I play on the Index with Revive, this was meant for the index, throwing hatchets is awesome with Index.. Looks great. Runs great, plays great. Also it is supposed to be quite long (no where near finishing it yet, so can't say for sure). Know what I'm doing with my afternoon off tomorrow though :-). Cant believe the scores this game is getting, This is NOT how you make a VR game its has so little interactions that could only be possible in vr, the combat is laughable like seriously, Feels like you have a wall as a sword and the same with the shield, you can block attacks even if your shield is way off because the hitboxes are crap, Story is pretty meh, movement is slow. but i cant get past the horrible combat. feels like a 2016 game.. Someone said in another review that if this was a flat game it would get a 6/10, well, I don't think so but the thing is this is NOT a flat game, this is a VR game. The best I could describe it is God of War in VR, a game I played recently and really enjoyed. Which one do I prefer? Asgard's Wrath, without the slightest doubt. There is something unique about VR, about being in that world that flat just can't convey and that already makes it more special. Add to that some of the best graphics to date, lots of hours of gameplay, variety, good side missions, puzzles and an epic adventure and that's pretty much what Asgard's Wrath is. The first couple of hours are nothing but an expanded tutorial, nothing too special or mindblowing but after that the game just gets better and better and better all the time. All the playable characters are great, level design is superb and there is a lot of love and attention to detail in every part of the game. Overhyped games rarely live up to that hype but in the case of AW it does. It has the quality, it has the content and it certainly has the price. One could always look for some minor flaws here and there, like in every other game but overall AW is a fantastic game that has instantly become one of VR's best offerings, comparable to any 2D game in quality and content.. This is how you make a VR game. Game is beautiful. The first AAA VR game. This is seriously the best VR game I have ever played.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I think this is the VR game that many of us dreamed about. The first true AAA VR game, wonderfully designed, engaging, and beautiful. This is an experience not to be missed. It's certainly not perfect, yet despite it's minor flaws it's head and shoulders above any other game I've played in VR.. Love it so far. The load screens are a tad long, but I am running it on a laptop with a 1060 so I figure that's to be expected. By far one of the most gorgeous games I've ever played. Character models are excellent and intuitive VR game mechanics are well implemented. Combat is fun and engaging, although a physics based system might be better.. Simply the best VR game on the market. This is a AAA game that I've sink over 20 hours and I'm not even half done with the game. To think that this cost only $40 just blows my mind. it is easily better than most $60 flat games I've played.. Flat game with a VR perspective and very rudimentary VR mechanics. This might be cool for your first or second VR experience (when the ""ooo stereoscopy"" thing is novel enough to overwhelm all of VR's current issues) but stuff like this will leave people thinking VR is a gimmick. When we're this early on in VR tech, you need to actually take advantage of VR if you want people to use it for more than a few months. I trudged through it just so I could give it a fair review but otherwise I would not want to tolerate VR for this. So I'm not too harsh on it I'll rate it as a flat game: As a flat game this would be 6/10.. VR Action RPG at its finest. One of the first games that gets sword play right in VR (parrying and blocking). It's not completely physics based combat (like B&S), but unlike the pure physics based games the sword play in Asgard's Wrath is challenging. The textures used are very detailed, just looking around and exploring the game world is fun! I'm only 7 hours in and I've only played a small fraction of the content. Asgard's Wrath offers a lot, but is it fun to play ? Heck ya it is ! I've been waiting years for a VR game like this, there's just so much quality here. TLDR - want a FUN high budget made for VR action RPG that promises 30+ hours of gameplay ? Then Asgard's Wrath is your game !. Ever wish you could travel to Azeroth or Middle Earth? Well this is as close as it gets. I hope this studio keeps em' comin!","""half life alyx"" is an amazing game, but i had even better time with ""asgard's wrath!"". Mediocre game. Story is forgettable. Graphics are fine. Combat is anoying on every diffculty level."
507.Wipeout Pure,"A classic. Used to get beat at this all the time but I had a blast playing it.. Way too hard, to the point of pure frustration, specially in the latest, fastest races.. The Wipeout series gets back on track after the disappointing Fusion on the PS2 with a PSP version that looks and sounds top notch. It does make the same mistake as previous Wipeout games in that the difficulty curve is rather off; the early levels are a walk in the park but the later levels are frustratingly over-difficult. The sequel Pulse rectifies this as well as adding a wealth of new modes which makes it the natural choice over this instalment, but it's still well worth a look for racing fans.. Masterpiece. Fantastic controls and gimmicks, fully customizable experience, easily reachable free dlc content, and progressive skill cap. Must play.. its ok for psp game............................................................. Great mechanics. Superb track design. Superb music. That is really all you need to know because that is the recipe for an awesome racing game. But there are a few other areas I'd like to touch on. There are some issues with structure and progression. Although the tournaments are very fun, after you unlock a new speed class its basically rinse and repeat. The game doesn't tell you how to unlock new tracks so its easy to get the feeling after completing the third or forth tournament that you've seen everything the game has to offer meanwhile there are still tracks to unlock. The game also has free DLC that nearly doubles the amount of content. Being a launch title for the PSP, Pure was stuck running on the CPU's 222 MHz clock speed. This caused some noticeable performance problems. In a firmware update that came years later, developers were allowed to use the PSP's full 333 MHz clock speed but Pure never took advantage of this. In Single Race and Tournament modes, the game held 60 FPS but when weapons fired it often caused a drop in the frame rate that lasted for a few seconds. Sometimes it would drop into the 40's and even 30's. Being a fast paced racing game, response time is paramount and my ability to play well was sometimes affected by these performance hiccups. It wasn't a constant problem but it happened enough to be annoying. Strangely the developers limited Zone, Time Trial, and Free Play modes to 30 FPS. This was an odd decision because you would think those were the modes that would be easier to maintain 60 FPS because there are no A.I. opponents or weapons to fire. So you lost a lot of fluidity in those modes that you need in a game like this. There were also a few bugs such as inconsistent thrust from performing barrel rolls. Regardless it still looks very good on PC with an emulator and you can run it at a perfect 60 FPS in all modes (using a cheat code for the emulator).. Wipeout Pure is honestly one of the best racing games made especially for a portable, this is truly a console experience on a portable that is worth getting. You'll love the sheer difficulty, the amount of content there is available, the unique style gameplay and design and of course the music which matches quite nicely with the overall design of the Wipeout Pure experience.. A fun and frantic racer that has great visuals and art direction. Controls are smooth, tracks are sufficiently bendy and the soundtrack perfectly suits the action. A larger choice of vehicles and tracks would have made this game even better.. I never got into Mario Kart so I'm not exactly the right person to review this but there's not much else to see here. It's basically Mario Kart with futuristic cars. Very beautiful game with an awesome soundtrack but overall, not much different from similar games.. I'm a bit of a white-knuckler flyer, so handheld gaming is a must. I bought my PSP for this game (and bought 3 more copies for my friends so we could play it in ad-hoc multiplayer). Great fun - good for smack talk. Still play it. In my mind, it's far superior to its successor Pulse. I have no idea how to finish this game, it's so tough in the faster classes, but I've had a great time trying. This game and Lumines were a promising start for the system.",the Wipeout series gets back on track after the disappointing Fusion on the PS2 . the sequel Pulse adds a wealth of new modes which makes it the natural choice . there are some issues with structure and progression .
508.A Short Hike,"The title itself describes the game. It's short, little adventure. Doesn't get much more complex than that. It's definitely cozy but doesn't stick much after you finish it. 88 score is too much for this game IMO. People who gave this game less than eight don't know what they're saying because this game is fantastic, has a great story, great gameplay, great world, great characters, everything.. 30 years on this Earth and A Short Hike makes me glad to be a gamer. Overwhelmingly brilliant, and that's not even regarding the development team of what, 1 man and a composer? The theme and charm of Animal Crossing expressed as an Adventure game: -it has the best gliding in any game ever -an excellent LAYERED soundtrack -fantastic storytelling for the level of a basic premise (AAA devs TAKE NOTE) -down-to-earth (often funny) dialogue from a cozy cast of NPCs -lush visuals. A top-down, open world, non-linear Platformer Adventure game- an introspective journey away from city life to find oneself indulging nature amidst looming teenage angst and family turmoil. Claire must explore to earn Golden Feathers and further increase her climbing stamina (and glide time) to ascend a conflicting mountain peak at the heart of the game's richly-spoiled, forest-laden world. Aside from the backend of the map being an unworkable cliff-face, the game is otherwise utterly flawless. One of the best games ever made, easily. The game is around 4 hours long, 6 to 100% completion. As long as it needs to be, and short enough to ingrain itself in your brain for years. Always leave the audience wanting more and never outstay your welcome. A f* Masterpiece of fun.. Cute graphics and charming characters. Very fun and creative. The story is so cute and sends us a beautiful message. Very cozy game!. Such a wonderful, peaceful, and enjoyable experience. I absolutely loved this game. The music, writing, gameplay, and graphics were all perfect. Highly recommended.. ( sorry for bad english im french) A short hike is a very unique game that i loved playing. like is title says, the game is ""a short hike"" but a long journey in the reflexion about how this game can relax and change the mindset of someone who discovers it.I started the game with no big interest in, the title just gave me curiosity but i have no regret playing it. The game is very smooth to play and with funny caracters. there is also very good music and a good story. in the 48 i played there was 0 minutes of boring. thanks. Absolutely wonderful little game. Simple gameplay mechanics. A fun and moving story in a short and effective package.. This game is short but worth it! A beautiful immersive game with pretty colors, funny dialog, fun adventurous, and a great story. 9/10. One of my favourite games i have ever played.Truly worth every dollar and every cent.. Favorite game ever, such a cute game that accomplishes everything its needs to. Masterpiece!. Relaxing and fun adventure gaming experience. perfect for all ages. I had a ton of fun exploring. Interesting story with engaging dialogue that doesn’t get in the way of gameplay.. What you take away from this game will likely be a result of how you play it. The first time I played A Short Hike, I made my way straight the final goal quickly. I finished it in about an hour. I thought the game was okay, but nothing special. I tried playing it a second time a few weeks ago, and I finished it with a much more positive opinion. This time, I took my time to explore the island, get to know characters, and finish the side quests. I was surprised at how many little things densely populated the small island. I'm still not sure if I found them all. Experiencing a lot of the adventures on the island will add to the ending of the game. My suggestion is to take your time with this one in order to get the most out of it.. Exactly what you hope for when you think ""cozy, indie game"" except not nearly as twee. The premise is that you are trying to hike up a mountain, with some side quests and achievements along the way. The hiking mechanic is surprisingly accurate to what it feels like in real life, with plenty of scenic visuals that will make you pause and take a screengrab. There is no dying, so exploration and meandering is encouraged. Highly recommended for all ages from young to old, newbies or seasoned gamers who just want a break from the latest AAA.. Such a charming little game that really lives up to it's name (only takes an hour or two to complete). A perfect bite sized experience with a fitting soundtrack and nice sound design. I had a few moments where the controlls really infuriated me, other than that the game is perfect for what it is. Sadly the artstyle wasn't my thing here, though I can see plenty of people liking it.. It's an adorable little game with some simple but fun mechanics. Characters are interesting but grounded, and the story has a deceptive amount of heart. It's worth playing, especially for the finale and the veiws that come with it, but while a quality game it doesn't have that much going on. This is the best damn cozy game around, if you have a Playstation and get enough points on the app, this is an easy pick, its the cheapest reward too. It's just so charming in how it looks, sounds, reads, its not a perfect game, but I don't have it in me at all to not give it a 10. A masterpiece of exploration and good vibes.. A Small Hike is a fun little game; visual style is nice and it's satisfying enough to spend a couple of hours with. Saying that, it is very short (as the name suggests!) and there's not enough of a pull to explore every nook and cranny.. Very short yet very sweet. While the core game can easily be completed in less than an hour, the polished controls, stylish yet retro visuals, rewarding collectibles, and endearing story make for a delightful title.. A Short Hike is a short game, but it packs a lot of enjoyment into its roughly 90 minutes of playthrough. I found it to be quite charming and very relaxing; I had a smile on my face from start to finish. For less than the price of a movie ticket, you get a delightful experience that makes a perfect palate-cleanser or just a nice way to kill time on a rainy Sunday afternoon.. This game was so refreshing to play, the fact that I could just do whatever whenever was amazing, It really emersed me in the experience, the art style is cute and fits the gameplay very well. Using the wings you collect as a progression device was executed well as the more you got the more options for exploration could be achieved, its too good.. awww I loved this game so much! Is one of my favourite in the last 10 years A magical/friendly journey Take your time, and enjoy this lovely walk. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A short hike is good. It's relaxing, and has some enjoyable exploration. While I don't believe it's the most rewarding experience, there is a certain charm that oozes from it. It isn't anything special, but it is a fun time.. A Short Hike is a open-world exploration game that allows you to do what you want when you want to. The gameplay is fun and exciting and gives you a lot of ways to figure out how to get past the objective easily without getting annoyed. However, the game doesn't require much effort and takes not very long to fully complete the game, which is disappointing. Now, i wonder why it's called A Short Hike lol.. this game is very ugly and repetitive. the gameplay is very boring. a looking cheap game.. This game was exactly what I wanted it to be and more. It's short, relaxing and had a beautiful art style as well as interesting animal characters (which even ACNH couldn't do) Highly recommend. this game is not good. very lazy gameplay. the game is not fun and not interactive.. Two of the comfiest hours I've ever had. Artstyle and music are absolutely lovely. Also, the feather collecting is very satisfying. This game knows what it wants to do and succeeds at it greatly! If you like chill out games, this one is for you!. The game description sounded boring. However, great reviews and low price convinced be to give it a shot. The first few minutes were dull, but I kept on playing. Then it clicked. It’s Breath of the Wild meets Animal Crossing. You can fly/climb higher the more you discover. It’s relaxing, but still very engaging.. Short, but sweet, funny and lovely. The music also adds to a good feeling when playing the game.. A short but fun and easy to play game. If you are looking for a fun afternoon feel-good game, this one is a great option.. + Stylistically, it's a perfect game = Exploration vibes are totally here, but camera kills some of the flow - Doing 100% achievements is a boring grind. A young bird, known as Claire, heads arrives at a large nature reserve to stay with her aunt for the summer. Expecting an important phone call she’s informed the only place to get reception is at Hawk Peak, the highest point in the park. Having never been to the summit before she decides to hike to the summit. Allowing players to explore the game-world at their own pace and interacting with the various inhabitants is an unusually relaxing gaming experience, and even with little in the way of challenge and a short (3-4 hour) running time, I couldn’t help but be won over by A Short Hike’s charms.. This game is a charming, fun and relaxing game, with good controlls and a nice setting, plus some fun dialogue. The problem is that its WAY too short. Ill say its Too short, but sweet. It would be nice if it was a little. I bought this game on sale and its pretty good, but that short lenght really sticks out, at least to me, so i cannot give it a higher score.. Wow... Just finished playing it. This game is transcendent. It is literally a form of therapy, while I was playing I was so distracted by the beautiful style of the game, the amazing music, the many villagers and their mini games and quests, and above all my mission to reach the peak. I will definitely replay this game whenever I'm feeling down. The ending moved me to tears and it just makes you feel so warm inside. Don't be thrown off by the price to hours played ratio... I promise you it is worth it!!!!. We’ve truly been blessed over the past 6 months or so with a strong run of generally bite-sized exploratory adventures that focus far more on the wonder of nature and discovery than the normal more action-oriented fare typically out there. A Short Hike, though only lasting a few hours, seems to have that perfect ratio to keep everything tight and satisfying, never having to wander too far before you see something to be found, someone to interact with, or a hint at something you may be able to discover later with the right equipment. Moving around the scenic park you’ll encounter a variety of people, some there to help you and some in need of some quick help which typically won’t have you tromping around to find what they’re looking for. It may not have loads of depth or character development but honestly you’re likely to be so enchanted with the beauty of your surroundings and the clean simplicity of the overall experience that it won’t matter a bit. A definite recommendation for people looking to relax or younger gamers with parents trying to find them something appropriate for just about any skill level. ****/2021/08/mini-reviews-august-18th-edition.html. I think A Short Hike is a fantastic game. I think this is a perfect game if you just want something new for a few hours. It is a dialogue based game that is funny, cute, and in some moments brings emotions. Absolutely a gem ****. If you have a Switch it goes on sale for pretty often and it is absolutely worth it.. 2 hours of absolute perfection. It's like the Great Plateau from Breath of the Wild but with the relaxed peaceful nature of Animal Crossing.. Absolute charmer. Short and sweet, lovely soundtrack, and a very wholesome story. I'd recommend this to anyone who just wants a feel good afternoon game. Shouldn't take you more than like 3 hours if you're a completionist, 2 just for the story.. This is such a lovely little game. Heartwarming, and with a unique art style. Initially I found myself wondering what the point was, but give it a couple of hours and you will start being drawn in. The ending was gorgeous. Highly recommended.. What about that! A lovely, charming game. I really enjoyed it. I felt drawn to the world. The controls and flying around, jumping all felt nice. The characters are very sympathetic, the dialogue is funny, the colors and the art style are cute. Simply loved it and will go back to re-play after a while. This is a delightful game, showing us what games can be with a bit of vision.. This game is just a relaxing time, I just wish it was a bit longer. Ppppppppp. An enjoyable but incredibly short experience as the title suggests. Quite a quaint little journey.. Don't expect the game of the year, but it is truly a very relaxing experience and, considering the cost, it's a must buy if you like this kind of games. The whole world has been cared for and you feel it throughout the journey. The plot is very simplistic but not in a bad way: it lets you focus on little details so that you can enjoy every inch of the island. This game can be shortly described with ""a breath of fresh air"".. An amazing short game the Give you all of these feelings you need for an hour, I felt happy and full of the feeling of summer and childhood while playing this game I cannot recommend it enough. Adorable, short, sweet, more than worth the price even though it's short. Great game to binge and then come back to in a few months for a fresh play. I love A Short Hike. It's one of my favourite games of all time. With charming characters and fun, engaging gameplay, i would recommend this game to everyone. Short. Sweet. Charming. Bought this on a whim and spent the most soothing afternoon ever with this game. I had collected too many powerups by the end so the final climb to the top left me with a ""huh, is that all"" but it fits with the story. Your experience might be different. Highly recommend buying.. A Short Hike is a charming short story with a surprisingly lot to do. The visuals took some getting used to for me but especially in handheld mode on the Nintendo Switch that went rather quickly. The endearing story really fits in the small and lively open world. The developer created the right setting with the choice of colors and audio. The controls are very smooth, making it a joy to traverse the world by foot, wings or boat. The camera can play some tricks on you sometimes, but it certainly isn't game breaking. Also, the story is sweet, but in my opinion a little too short and, maybe due to this, not very memorable. However, for only € 6,99 in the Nintendo Switch eShop, you have great value for money.. For a long time I saw that game pop on various ""must play"" lists, but for some reason that game did not appeal me. But once I finally tried it out, I played it all in one go, and loved it. It's a very chill, charming game. A short game, but a fantastic game.. Oh boy had I a great time playing this piece of idleness. 100% stress relieving. GOTY 2020.. this game is great, a must have for the switch. although not a very long game (as the name already hints) but what is there is just excellent. you have moved to an island from the city to find that you have no cell service, so you try and clime the tall mountain that makes up the island, and on your way you meet friendly inhabitants, and find all sorts of things that can help you along your way. this game is done really well, the great graphics, calming music, and simple game play and story leads to a very relaxing experience, where you keep going back to the game even after completing the story. 10/10 OF TEN GAME WOULD 100% RECOMMEND TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A NICE HEARTWARMING GAME TO PLAY.. It was a nice time, I found the graphics night. My only complaint was that it was a bit too short. Other than that, it was cool.. One of the most pleasant experiences I've ever had playing a game. If anyone worries about the length, you really shouldn't, for what this is it's the perfect length. Made an account just to post this review. Brought me back to when I was a kid, and you'd just spend a lazy weekend afternoon exploring in a game, in a time before progression, before youtube walkthroughs.. A personal favorite of mine and a perfect example of why gameplay time is not and should not be King. What starts as a fairly cute little quest to climb a mountain leads to a shockingly full island of fun and adorable activities, all of which seem designed specially to get you relaxed and happy. For anyone looking for a game to lift their spirits, there's nothing better.. It's highly overrated. The game is not bad by any means, but it's simply way, way too short to deserve all the praise it gets It took me about 2 hours to complete, and I don't feel the urge to play it again, ever. It's unfair that a game like this gets more credit compared to certain other indie games which took several years to develop.. My first impression of A Short Hike is that it was incredibly heartwarming. With so much to do in the world, it encourages multiple playthroughs, or for the player to take their time. I loved finding secrets and interacting with the numerous characters throughout the land. The story is short and sweet, with lots of side plots to dive into. If you want a game that will melt your worries away, A Short Hike is it.. I had a magical experience with the game. The art style, map design, characters and everything was more than I expected from the game. Art style was satisfying to look at, characters are fun to interact with, gameplay is simple, soundtrack is amazing, story is not deep at all. Perfect game to play at 2-3 AM.. Getting lost in the wilderness can be a frightful thought, but the tranquility that it offers in Adamgryu’s imagining is anything but. The appropriately named “A Short Hike” is the most blissful nature walk that never outstays its welcome. It is sure to have you grinning ear-to-ear with every side trail you stumble upon. While short (the game can be completed in one swift sitting), this bite-sized experience is easy to digest and left a lasting impression on me. If it is not perfect, it is very close to it. Join me on this short review of A Short Hike. The feature most apparent as you load up the game for the first time is the visuals. Pixels are jagged, giving it an appearance of something you might see in the mid 90’s. I thought that it added charm, and it was clear that a creative choice was made here. Perhaps not everybody will feel the same, but fear not, because it is possible to adjust the visuals in the settings menu. After my eyes could not take much more of the large and chunky pixels, I switched it over to the sharpest image quality, and I was astonished by what a difference this made in my overall enjoyment. The game looks stunning with the more refined graphics, and I find it hard to believe that this was developed by just one person. As you start your journey on this small island, you are treated with a cutscene of sorts. It appears that there is someone driving you, Claire, to a summer camping trip, and then you are thrown into the game with little else to go on. As you take your first steps out of the cabin, you discover that your phone has no reception at the base of the island. You are then tasked with scaling the steep mountainside to make a phone call. Along the way, you will meet some colorful characters and have some amusing conversations, none of which are mandatory. This is one of those experiential titles, where you can play it however you would like. If you want to cut all the side missions and just ascend to the top in one quick swoop, you can. I do not recommend playing it that way though. The richness of the extra content you will stumble upon along the way can only be fully appreciated if you stop and smell the roses. Take this game at your own pace and be pleasantly surprised by what it has to offer. The music in this game is so relaxing. Actually, everything about A Short Hike is relaxing, but the music stands out in this department. I will link you to one song out of the soundtrack that gives me happy, care-free vibes. You can listen to it here on YouTube. The acoustic strings, the light bongos, and the piano melodies make this one of my all-time favorite soundtracks of any game. It is music that makes you feel, and this game really does evoke some strong emotions. While creative liberties shaped this game into an emotional ride, the gameplay holds up as well. The most appealing mechanic in the game would have to be the flying, or more appropriately, gliding. By holding the A button, you can float ever so gently, slowly losing altitude for every second that passes in the air. It is really satisfying to jump off a ledge and float to another ledge off in the distance. By pressing A as you glide, you can use a golden feather to flap your wings and fly, elongating your hang-time. You can also climb which will be crucial in making it to the peak of the mountain. While flying is by far the more appealing option, climbing will burn through golden feathers a lot slower than the simple flap of your wings, making it the more practical method. It is hard to judge the replay value A Short Hike has. It will differ from person to person. I am inclined to play it again, maybe in a year or two, so the experience is not fresh in my mind. It is one of those games that almost makes me wish I could play it again for the first time. The game is incredibly short, spanning only a couple hours maximum. In those two hours, I felt this was an adventure well worth the price of entry, but you may not share this sentiment. For those who are looking for a lot of bang for your buck, you may want to look elsewhere. If you are looking for something short and fun to get emotionally invested in, this is that game. I believe this game is a masterpiece, but I am also aware that it may not jive with everyone. If you thought everything outlined in this review is something you would enjoy, then I would highly recommend you jump on this one. I certainly did not regret it, and I am hopeful that neither will you.. This is game - while you play u relax, no stres just you and open world island with characters.. Playing the game only for a short while you can already tell that you are in for a treat, definitely worth the price tag to get this game and play it.. Extremely short and simple, and i was painfully missing an ingame map, but still, made with love and passion, and a nice and reaxing experience... Also, +1 score for being completely free of violence, and for allowing the player an extreme amount of freedom and exploration.. This is an amazing game. The game itself is very short. I think you can finish it in about an hour easily. It's very relaxing...this game actually follows through on the promise of being a relaxing game. It's basically you climbing up a mountain, and then finding and earning feathers so that you can fly around, and flying is crucial for reaching the very top of the mountain. Initially the graphics are really bad, but you can fix it in the settings. Some people may like the weird, low rez graphics. I've already played through twice, and I'll probably play through it again a time or two.. Every climb feels rewarding, every glide feels satisfying and the hike feels... short, but not too short.. I absolutely love this game. It’s very chill and accessible. It gives me Animal Crossing vibes, but with a bigger island to explore and you can fly! This game may be the most joyful 2 hrs you’ll spend today.. Amazing game. Simple, cute, so efficient with the hiking-relaxing-holiday mood. I had to stop myself from completing it in one run since I had so much fun exploring this island. It's that kind of rare game where you wish it was bigger and longer (that's what she said). Also, it really gave me the impression of playing through an Miyazaki movie (not for the art style but for the impression it gives you and for the characters). One of the best 2020 game out there, and for 10$ it's such a bargain. Even if it takes like 6-7h max to complete it, every minute spent in this game is worth it, and that's really rare. GIVE US MORE PLEASE.. The game's pixel graphics really add to the game, creating a 3D experience that I could never recreate. The story is amazing and the beautiful view from places like the top of Mount Hawk are absolutely stunning. The gliding really puts the icing on the cake by giving you the ability to fly and explore. I would recommend this to ALL my friends.. A delightful game that warms your heart with funny and yet meaningful dialogs, nostalgic graphics and a lot of side quests that makes you feel immersed in this colorful tiny world, while you explore an island full of beautiful views, walking, flying, climbing, and swimming around it. The game is “a short hike”, indeed, since you could finish it a hundred percent in 5 hours (or less, if it is not your first time playing it), but every second makes it worth.. A Short Hike Short But sweet A Short Hike is a tiny adventure game where you play as Clair, a bird that sets out to reach the top of Hawks Peak so that she can make a phone call to her mom… as the name suggests short hike can be quite the short game, you can easily beat thi game in less than an hr and a half.. but a short hike isn’t about beating it, its about experiencing its world… A short hike is so full of charm and things to do, from collecting shells, finding secrets treasures, obtaining new items..fishing.. finding lost items… all to do one thing.. obtain more golden feathers o you can climb and fly your way to the top of the mountain, and I loved every minute of it… hile its visuals aren’t the best, they will grow on you… If youre into adventure games, where the goal is to just explore and take in the view, I highly recommend a short hike I give A Short Hike a 7.5/10. I've got pretty late on a ""A Short Hike"" hype train, but I'm here! It's an indie adventure game that may seem like nothing special, but in reality it's different. Starting from graphics, it has a low resolution, but it gives an option to choose between smooth edges and chunky pixelated ones (I chose the smooth ones xD). Exploration in this game is what makes it truly great. In every part of the island camera is set in a way so the player cannot take a peek at some stuff. It makes the exploration experience more intriguing. There are some quests to do, but mostly it's the pure exploration. Obviously, you can rush to the peak of the island to finish the game. However, I cannot relate to people who rush games xd It's a short game even without the rush, I think it took me 4 or 5 hours to finish it at 100%. To be honest, I collected my last 2 golden and 2 silver feathers after reaching the peak of the mountain... Soundtrack was comfortable, visuals were vibrant and colorful, controls were easy to understand and the overall experience was satisfying. I really adore the aspect of climbing as well as gliding in the exploration games and here both of these mechanics were phenomenal. Short and Sweet, comfy game for a one sitting!. The style is peaceful and beautiful, the game is really to be enjoyed at your own pace. It's a short game but that's the point (it's even in the title!). Little games and quests on your way to the top are really fun, and the game really makes you want to chat with everybody and help out. ""Completing"" the game feels really like you finished a beautiful hike. Props to the (only!) dev and his great work. I played it on the mac and my partner played it on the switch, and I have no problem giving this guy money twice honestly, and hoping he'll make more games!. A sweet little game that, despite it seemingly childish visual style, silently tells a story of personal well-being. Controls are intuitive and tight. World design constantly urges the player to explore more with curious finds everyone. Movement is intrinsically satisfying, as exploration allows greater movement, which allows more exploration, and so on. Definitely a feel-good game. The affordable price tag is well worth the 2-3 hours of gameplay to complete the story.. Nice little game about a peacefull hike in the wilderness, recommended. The artstyle is unique. Many games sell themselves as ""chilled"" or ""relaxing"", but A Short Hike is the game that I wish I could play again and again when I'm looking to ease my mind. Unfortunately, it doesn't lend itself to repeated play–and like its name says, it's extremely short. I'm a very slow player, but even I could see the ending of this game in about two hours. That short playtime, however, is not a shortcoming. On the contrary, this game is made even better by its limited length. For those two hours, A Short Hike tells a heartwarming little story, set in a nice miniature open world, full of paths to explore and side quests to complete. None of those side quests feels boring–you won't see any pointless collect-a-thons in this game. Everything has a place, and contributes to make A Short Hike a beautiful, if quick, escapade.. It looks allright, the color palette is nice, flaoting in the air is nice enough, and the interactions between the various characters are quite cool - but overall, this game is just so boring. Nothing really happens. You just follow a trail, and find some stuff here and there - 0 engagement. The camera angle is weird as well, making you fall long distances from time to time. I'm sure games like these has its audience, but this certainly wasn't for me.. Great game, loved to play it. Could be bigger, hope they launch another one in the near future it’s a must buy, great sound, design and feel. Very relaxing to play.. A beautiful game with fantastic atmosphere and utterly relaxing gameplay style. This game is a simplistic but expansive playground that is a joy to explore. Easy to get lost into and really easy to make your own fun in. The only issues I have is with the camera, there are multiple moments in the Game I found where the camera wouldn’t follow me as I would have wanted. Other than that the only other thing I had wanted is more! This game just feels like my new happy place.. Disarming, charming, **** relaxing too! The controls are smooth as silk, and the less you know about this game going into it, the better. It’s the perfectly distilled essence of everything that makes gaming fun.. A short hike is one of those feel good games. The environment and game play is relaxing ,the characters is quirky and sweet. The artwork is amazing. Played it at a very slow pace to experience the whole world, took about 4 hours to complete. Well done to the creators of this title. Well worth the play.. This game is like a sweet cream on pie. True gem. It is extremely relaxing. I love this game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. 10 out of 10 is a too low. One of the greatest adventures available on Switch. This game is absolutely stunning, relaxing and allows you to play at your own pace. Tho pretty short, it's a wonderful experience and would recommend it to anyone!. I played it before on PC and it was great, but when I played it on Switch I've loved it much more than ever. Switch is a perfect medium to play this game.. You can run through everything the game has to offer in a couple hours, which might be a turn-off for some. Even to those people I'd say: wait for a sale but get it. It's a gorgeous, funny and heart-warming little title. The environments are stunning, the character interactions are frequently chuckle-worthy, and movement (whether it's flying, swimming or running) feels real smooth. It's a relaxing experience, like taking a mini-vacation.. A shockingly entertaining and rewarding game where I rarely went the correct way and was never punished for it.

509.XCOM 2: War of the Chosen,"Best tactical game ever, I got +1640hours ^^ This addon add more challenge,I never got bored. Not many games make impending life-and-death situations meaningful, like XCOM 2, a turn-based tactical strategy game with squad management and base-building mechanics. Each choice you make is crucial, and even a single mistake can have a significant effect on your outcome. This dynamic combat puzzle features ruthless enemies with intelligent AI who show no mercy to the player. Developing a bond with all your badass soldiers and fitting them out as the mission entails is fun in itself, but when everything comes together, it provides a dopamine rush and cathartic relief that few games ever manage. War of the Chosen is a robust expansion that brings about an essential overhaul for XCOM 2. Numerous quality-of-life improvements have been made. Player choice, customization, and mission variety have been greatly expanded. The lore is enhanced by the addition of new hero classes and enemies. An already excellent campaign is built upon with an extra layer of depth and replay value. Not to mention, it improves the performance of the base game by removing the annoying lag spikes and stuttering. This DLC is a must-have for fans who want an even more refined adrenaline rush experience.. God does not play dice. It's a well-crafted turn-based strategy game with a solid combat system. While I didn't get deeply immersed in the world, it was still enjoyable.. This is an expansion done right. Originally priced at $40, this DLC literally doubled the content of the original game and added and entirely new campaign that is equally as long as the first. Beyond that, it added tons of cool new features including new classes, new cosmetics, new mission types, new enemy types, and other cool features like creating propaganda photos. This was something closer to XCOM 2.5 more so than a DLC. It completely revised the campaign structure into a whole new overarching gameplay element and plot. I still highly recommend playing the original first because it’s fantastic, and because you really should experience the vanilla game to get an understanding of the fundamentals as this game is far more challenging and punishing. I gave the vanilla game a 10/10, I am giving this expansion a 9/10 because it breathes so much life on the already incredible vanilla game. With that being said, I love it because it’s more XCOM 2. I found the campaign to be a little worse, instead of the arms race against the aliens, now there are a lot of characters and story arcs thrown in. Some people may prefer that, but I liked feeling like humanity’s last hope was in your hands instead of a Hollywood story. I personally think this style of a campaign just makes it feel like any other game.. With mods game is super 9, otherwise score 8 is more appropriate. I have finished game 5x. Twice without mods, 4x with ""tired"" mechanic and once without ""tired"" mechanics include quality of life mods, 3x speed upgame and this deserved 9. Its turn based strategy game, which has its rules and few wtf moments, which you have to get through to learn mechanics. Learning curve is therefore rather steep and mistakes are unforgiving. Start of the game is very hard. Later, when your soldiers gain levels and when you get better armor, game starts to be much less stressful and much more ""arcade fun"" and that makes smile on your face, when your sharpshooter one hit kill robot across whole map, or when ranger smashes all attackers with blade when he is in front line. Specialist heals and gives defense bonuses and made my soldiers ""invincible"" many times. There are few more types: psio has most abilities, reapers make game nice tactic battle etc.. Strongest side of game is imo fact, you are commander and your soldiers are counting on your commander skills, so you want them to not only finish mission, but you also want them return home uninjured and alive. That wants you to be better in the game. Its fun and you see on yourself progress in that matter. Actually in last game I have lost only two soldiers, otherwise be prepared to loose much more of them. Game has some for me strange mechanics when enemy can pull you through wall, but you can not shoot them, sometimes robots can go through wall or appear from nowhere. It happens like 3x per game, so ironman, is not for me, nevertheless I was able to finish game without loading game though. Graphics is pretty and thanks to customization menu, you can make soldiers be indentified in game by colors - blue is ranger, red is sniper etc. I was using all mods for speed up game and quality of life. Without those game is frustrating and makes you wander what you can sell, which soldiers can be bond, who is intelligent most etc. Without mods its a mess and very frustrating. I have also removed ""tired"" mechanics in 5th playthrough in .ini file and game is much more fun and better. With ""tired"" I have enjoyed game only once, its only prolonging game and make game rather tedious and slower in its pace. Super fun game with mods 9/10 especially 3x speed game, otherwise its good for experience 8/10. I would even consider give 9, but ""Lost"" in the game is just killing it. Good luck Commander! OLED + 110"" screen, surround.. Extremely difficult, but fun, and there are a lot of mods out there for it. Has unlimited replay ability.. My second most played game on steam with a unholy amount of hours played. Truly top class.. I find that this DLC is too much, campaign feels overcrowded. Still, a lot of what they added is good.. There's nothing quite like needing that one critical shot, and you tune up the alien and the green blood is spraying everywhere. It's a wonderful feeling. I love this game.. It's one of the funniest games ever. This is the most immersive expansion pack that complements the deficiencies of the existing XCOM 2. Numerous supported mods make it even more fun. Numerous supported mods make it even more fun.. Fav Games - Skyrim, Witcher 3, Mass Effect Trilogy, Stellaris, Sins of a Solar Empire, Company of Heroes 2, Divinity Original Sin 1+2 *Immersion and/or Strategy for me* Xcom 2 was already a good game, worthy of 88-90 on metacritic. With all the DLC and WotC it is now o. Play it. I don't care how old it is, nor what games you usually play. Shut up and play it, you'll love it. PS: I'm an old fart so my opinion may be skewed, but I feel like anything I would give a 10/10 would end up being a 6/10 for the mass market. So its at least okay.. This is one of the very few games I come back to again and again. For me it has more replayability than any other game I've ever played (except maybe the Dark Souls games, but it's not even close). This comes down to a few main reasons. Firstly, the tactical squad gameplay hits some kind of sweet spot for me. I love turn-based games because they give me time to think about my decisions, which allows depth without getting hectic. At the same time it's not too complex for me. In comparison to the original X-COMs, I prefer the two-phased action system to the original action point system, and also the streamlined inventory. Secondly, each campaign offers enough unpredictability for me to draw me back in. With the optional ironman mode, which prevents save-scumming, I can find a difficulty setting that gets me into that precious flow where I feel competent, but things can still go awry or even end in catastrophic failure. The procedurally generated maps are varied enough that you won't feel deja-vu, without making the locations a jumbled mess of random tiles. While the overarching campaign progression is the same every time, you get randomized events and research opportunities, and a plethora of new mechanics and soldier classes introduced by the various DLCs. All in all, it mixes everything up nicely and nudges you to do things differently than last time. That said.. without exaggeration, you can get a whole new game when you install the Long War 2 mod (****/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=844674609), which changes almost everything. Not for the faint of heart, but highly recommended! Thirdly, every XCOM operative you lead into battle can be customized by classes which have different stats, and with combat experience upgrade within at least two skill branches. Also, every soldier is a named individual with their own looks and backstory. They can be randomly generated, or you can create your pool of soldiers yourself, or import whole sets of popular characters from movies, games, and cartoon franchises. If I want to be critical, I would have liked a bit more freedom in the strategic geoscape layer. But if I have to choose between the complete freedom of the original X-Com and the slightly rail-roaded system of XCOM 2, I take the latter. While I don't like having to arbitrarily choose between three missions, I hated floundering about in the old games deciding if and when and where to build another base that I then could not staff and equip sufficiently. But that's just me not liking too much complexity, I guess. So, if you have even a passing interest in tactical turn-based games, I think you will like XCOM 2 very much.. Would reload savegame again. ..................…............................ Had not much luck with my recent shopping and i'm really tired of giving 0 scores. Tried some new games some old ones and finally i got lucky. I found the story surprisingly good, but i may be easy to please at the moment after seeing the TLOU 2 mess. After the first missions i was thinking about quitting and going back to XCOM 2 with Longwar thinking it has more to offer. Then i had the first story mission and it was quite a positive surprise. It was different compared to the usual mission types and i had no idea what would happen. That's what i like in a game, good entertainment. And afterwards the game got more complex and the urge to go back to longwar is gone. Don't think i should compare those two anyway. I feel it's kind of a different experience and both are good in their own way. Would be a 10 for me without the trouble i had installing mods. Steam Workshop worked without problem, but installing other mods was a pain. Seems you have to put them in both mod folders xcom and wotc to get them working with the default launcher and it was several hours of searching the internet and a lot try and error until i had everything running.. I decided to write a separate reviews on the game in general and an DLC about the chosen ones. So, about the chosen ones: An excellent additional test of your skills for the main game, which is organically inscribed in the main game, without distortions of balance and adding, in a way, three mini-bosses. The plot justification of these chosen ones, their characters, their strongholds with ""last battles"", everything is just wonderful. This DLC gets from me a ""good"" rating, as I am still disappointed that the percentage randomness still does not take into account logic and context in 2020 year(the shotgun comes close to the enemy with 80% of the hit, and you still miss).. if you like xcom games or fan of strategy and tactics games this is THE PERFECT game for you!. This expansion didn't fix the problems of the base game for me, I preferred the build up and design of the first game.. I enjoyed XCom 2 when it came out, but felt that the game finished a bit too quickly. I had to move swiftly to the endgame before I'd finished a lot of research, to stop Advent completing the Avatar project. I waited until WOTC was on sale at Steam before giving it a try, and (as others have said), it really re-invents the game. Now more challenging, more varied and more enjoyable. There are still a few **** that stopped me giving it a straight 10: missions are a bit repetitive; dialogue even worse; and there are some odd annoyances -- such as Dark Events that threaten you with increased Chosen activity even after you've eliminated them all. But, overall, it's a lot of fun. If you're too slow (and too old in my case) for real-time strategy and games that rely entirely on quick reactions, this is for you. it's a game that makes you think and has enough depth to make it more than just blasting aliens. Highly recommended.. Hi I am Xcom veteran player. I finished Xcom 2 long ago just have chanced to play WOTC. I would say I really liked it at first but then, many things started to annoy me. First of all, Lost (zombies) are boring. It requires very few same strategies to handle, like stay away, keep your gun full and unload them all in one turn. Those zombies are only fun for first few missions, then it become tiresome to deal with. Second, Bondmate (why ?), this system , again, seems interesting at first. Then later, you will notice that you have spent too much time for this matchmaking. Because of its good benefits, everytime bringing solider, you will likely to check who his bondmate is, or has good compatibility with him, if his bondmate is still tired, then should we wait or ..... bla bla bla thinking. In the end, does this system make the game more fun ? NO, it is quite opposite. Moreover, compatibility is RNG, something you cannot control. When you start the game and have team that has bad compatibilty with each others, you gonna feel like WTF, should I restart my campaign or what ?. Third, the new three classes, though everyone feel creative and fun to play. You are limited to have only one of each. (and later, another one) so total is only 4. Seriously, why ?? . why can't we just recruit them like normal soliders. In WOTC, there is tiring system so you need like 3 teams (6x3 = 18 guys) to play this game efficiently. 4 (and only 1 per class) is not enough at all. Fourth, AP system. Why did they add this ? if you want to reward player for good flanking skill, just give XP bonus is enough. AP system is powerful tool, but again this based on RNG ! every solider can have different skill and YET also different in talent (RNG again). Why did you make too much RNG happen ? moreover this AP system can crossover skill of other classes, with mod in, you can make your soliders substitute some class entirely, like Ranger that can use shreder + chain shots skill of Grenadier, which become quite OP. I think the good part of class system is that everyone has his role, but now you destroyed it with this AP system, also destroyed the balance. Lastly, Resistance ring are powerful new facility, but it is about based management and it does not really add fun to gameplay. I am ok, but I feel like we don't need it. Vanila Xcom2 's base management is already complicated as it is. There is no need to add further. *** By the way, what I like about this DLC is the New chosens. Those three guys are very fun to fight against and they were geniusly intergrated into gameplay. New enemies and new maps are also welcome. *** In sum, War of the chosen added a lot of stuff in the game, which worth calling expansion and those things were intregated well in gameplay too. However, most of them does not make the game better, rather it makes the game more RNG and more base management. I am sad to see XCOM2 in this state. They should just add chosens and three new class availiable for normal recruit and new enemies new maps that should be enough.. They could have added 20% more content than this and called it XCOM 3 and I would have heaped praise on it. The fact that an expansion does so much to augment the experience, and does it all so right, I have no words. If you enjoyed XCOM at all you're in for a treat. If you've never played it, this is the right place to hop on, because WOTC really takes XCOM into a place where it can be talked about with the all time greats in gaming like Age of Empires and The Witcher 3.. War of the Chosen brings a whole new concept to the game but unfortunately the rest of the game is quite similar and repetitive once you've gone through the initial changes. If you've played xcom2 vanilla, you might find too many thing's that are pretty much the same.. (Ironman: 1 Move 1 Save, *prevents save scumming* (LOS: Line of Sight) Time spent with the game: -Logged in 1000+ hours over the span of 2 years Finally summary of XCOM 2 WOTC: -At its core wonderful masterpiece, the best turn based strategy game I have ever played. -Glitched to the nines with 0 fixes. -Losing is a part of the game, which I am fine with on Legendary difficulty, but there is nothing more frustrating then playing and investing over 20+hours into a Ironman run and losing the game because ****. Glitches as follows: -Enemy LOS broken, enemy randomly sees through walls, engage you while in concealment even tho you have not broken line of sight the computer will glitch and say you have been revealed when you have not touched the LOS squares. -Lancers LOS broken, enemy can attack players without having LOS, 1 shot kills -Played until the end, almost beat it, over 50+ hours invested, game crashed, Ironman save at crash point, no way to recover, game breaking bug, Developers KNOW and are AWARE of this issue have done nothing -Mandatory missions, that last over on some maps 2+ hours, game feels like a hard grind that never gives you a break -Graphics are excellent, Story Line is amazing, lead stars from Star Trek Generations as voice overs, over all the game is superior in every way shape and form, but due to game breaking bugs that make the game unplayable, this game gets a 4. -Simple patches, to fix the game breaking bugs, is all that would be required. *good enough* mentality no longer is acceptable. We pay BIG money for AAA games, we expect the iron upon the shirt, we expect the full service. Send a message to the gaming companies, hold them to account, let us stop paying $$$ for garbage errors.. Xcom 2 was great. War of the chosen is perfected. It's almost as if the devs had to rush out Xcom 2 in order to make a publishing date. Then after Xcom 2 release, they sat down and decided that they can now give Xcom 2 the polish they believe the game deserves. Once they completed this polish it was released as DLC named War of the Chosen. i honestly believe that War of the Chosen is the game the Devs wanted to release when first embarking on the Xcom 2 development journey. War of the Chosen is amazing. The best tactical, turn based game i've played.. When you install both XCOM 2 and War of the Chosen, WotC is deactivated by default. I'd really like to know who's genious idea that was. I noticed it like 10 hours into the game. **** you for wasting players' time like that.. This elevates the base game with a host of new features and enemies that further enhance an already amazing game!. Its always amazing how generous these so called critics are in their praise of these mainstream games. I can but assume they spent a quick half hour on the titles in many instances. XCom War of the Chosen can best be described as a ""hot mess"". Basically it takes the chaotic, disorganised game play of Xcom 2 and for the most part adds in more adversaries in general and ""boss"" characters you have to defeat. The absolute lack of balance makes for annoying game play not helped by the incessant cut scenes and prattling interruptions from your second in command and goading skype style calls from the Chosen. Its aggravating stuff that at times leaves you wondering why you are playing at all. 4/10 from me.. Age 34 Fav Games - Skyrim, Witcher 3, Mass Effect Trilogy, Stellaris, Sins of a Solar Empire, Company of Heroes 2, Divinity Original Sin 1+2 *Immersion and/or Strategy for me* Xcom 2 was already a good game, worthy of 88-90 on metacritic. With all the DLC and WotC it is now one of the very best strategy games ever made (I've played just a few of them..) It is seriously fantastic and has so much content, so many good ideas. I'm a bit disappointed in the 7.7 user review here.. This game is now atleast as good as D:OS2 but marked harshly... But I believe it's all due to one thing. THE GODDAMN DIFFICULTY LEVEL!!! It's BIGGEST, WORST, UNACCEPTABLE MISTAKE FIRAXIS. Most people are not strategy game veterans like myself and my mates that love this game. They get hammered by Xcom's four difficulty settings. Please change the first three firaxis, people are disliking your game because your difficulty settings don't match their expectations and they are getting frustrated, this would have earned you several more points on metacritic. No one wants to select rookie difficulty, do an analysis, it's a psychological thing. Rookie - This is really normal difficulty in any other game - you don't have an easy mode! Veteran - This is the second mode, this is really hard mode Commander - This is insane difficulty, for someone who has over 100 hours in the game Legend - Only for lock-ins playing the game with a rock band controller, full back xcom tattoo and a whip setting on the bench, for when they kill their soldiers. Basically XCOM 3, which is a great thing. I've really been enjoying the new mechanics, maps, and chosen. Just like Civilization xpacs, this really updates the entire game and genuinely is almost XCOM 3. It still has some minor performance issues (even on my 1080ti), and the hit percentages thing is even worse now because of the random pop-ins of super-powerful aliens that are nearly impossible to beat.. I've only just recently gotten into the XCOM series after my friend gifted me the first game, after putting 41 hours into that I knew I needed the second game so I grabbed the deluxe edition plus War of the Chosen as I wanted to experience everything the game had to offer. I finished the game today after putting 80 hours into it, so it was definitely money well spent. Overall I much preferred the sequel, it was improved in almost every way, with big additions, features and more subtle changes that made for a very enjoyable experience. It really felt like the devs learned a lot from the first game, and implemented a lot of fixes and changes the community wanted. One big area of improvement are the cut-scenes, they're very high quality this time around, and they run smoothly as they're videos, and not rendered in engine like in XCOM 1 (30fps videos look fine, 30fps in engine does not), they really helped to tell the story which was interesting, the voice work was also fantastic. There is one area where XCOM 2 sadly falls short and that's performance, the game is not optimised well at all, you will find countless people complaining about this issue so please don't think it's just me. Any form of explosions will cause big drops in frame rate, as will anything that causes debris to spawn. Also certain mission/mob types also tank the frame rate, it's just not good enough. The game also ""freezes"" quite often while it calculates, something that never happened in the first game, the issue gets worse the further you get into the game as abilities and enemies get more complex. It really did hurt the game for me, so much so it went from a weak 9 into a strong 8. That being said I still obviously enjoyed it a lot and highly recommend it, just be aware it does have technical problems if you're bothered by that sort of thing.. When I played XCom 2 I was worried at how modders could change enough the game to make it worth playing again (and having surprises and not knowing what would come ahead). Was expecting something like Long Run was for XCom 1. But then the makers came with this addon that seems almost like another game (some are calling it XCom 2.5) with the introduction of a few very well thought elements. The Choosen are great! The missions are way improved, it is a new game. I only was a bit disappointed with the last mission, its too much like the first one. But hey, they have to save some ideas for XCom 3!. The only strategy here is to play with the phone while the numerous enemies make their long turns through numerous, and repetitive, cutscenes. Really: it's boring. The other ""small"" problem is that - after waiting - you have little to reason because almost every mission has limited turns.. Beautiful, technical and brainstorming game, especially on hard mode. To me it was fairly addictive so you may want to check the clock in time to time. The only downside is that I would've preferred it to be longer.. Jagged Alliance 2 is still better. It is surprising, that this game still have some technical issues like: freezes, weapons' electro dance after enemies death (due to bad collision system). It should also have better system to speed up or skip shooting animations etc. as it gets dull and time consuming after hours of gameplay. Overall, still lots of improvements to make, devs has to focus more on the story, story missions and unique maps design. Players like procedural generation, but it is still not enough (the container with a car that crashed on one of its wall in every abandoned city map...).. Five Word Review: A great thing made greater. Favorite Thing: The Chosen and a nice component and challenge to otherwise standard missions. Least Favorite Thing: Very little changes to the base game, story, etc. Date Completed: 2017-09-30 Playtime: 60h (100% research) Enjoyment: 8/10 Recommendation: If you haven't played XCOM 2 before or it has been a while, yes.. Wanted to like this, loved Xcom 2, and looking at the features it looked great. However, on loading it up and jumping in, I just got annoyed really quickly, the map is just too busy, too much crap shouting for attention, too much clutter, rather than feeling fun it felt like the game was constantly hassling me, and not in a ""its a dangerous race to save the earth"" kind of **** a ""lets just keep bugging the player endlessly"" kind of way. It was so annoying, just quit. And everytime I go to log in....I just cant bring myself to. Its killed Xcom for me.. Very addictive game. This expansion utilizes the same base story from X-Com 2, but adds 3 new soldier classes (it's more like 3 heroes, as you can't train more of then), 3 bosses (The Chosen) that attacks you on missions that are on their turf on the map, a lot of new missions and mechanics. Like the TheWaffle said, the new content, along with the old, is presented too fast and you get overwhelmed by the information, which may be hard for new players. All in all is one of my favorite games of all time, you can easily spend a great amount of time playing it.. This expansion makes XCOM2 harder and more unforgiving, giving also so much content with the new factions and the choosen messing around. the new training system, the soldiers which buddy together and get special bound abilities make the strategic dimension of this game even larger than before. New Enemies make the game harder, your soldiers will die. a lot. to be mentioned the new options, when you start a new campaign, to double the avatar project meter and the mission timers, since the game gets harder, i really suggest to do so. nice compatibility with the precedent must-have expansion Shen's Last Gift and the one of the Vahlen superaliens. you can choose to have a simpler experience by adding the extra content (sparks, weapons and the three alien kings) without having the dedicated missions. that's good, after all, since the experience would be extra hard if not made so. All and all, a phenomenal must buy game and expansion.. One Word, Excellent! for me. :-) One Word, Excellent! for me. :-) One Word, Excellent! for me. :-) One Word, Excellent! for me. :-) One Word, Excellent! for me. :-). Did you like the original? If so, you HAVE to get this DLC. They improved everything in the game. Imagine everything you always wanted in the original just got added. New weapons, new bosses, new soldier classes, new enemies, and the cream of the crop, the new ability point system. Did you ever want a sniper with all the pistol and rifle skills? You can have it now. I will admit that it does lock up and reset itself at times and that is massively annoying given how long it takes to reboot the game and load your last save. Whatever. The improvements make up for it.. First of all I only give 10s for worth it and 1s for not worth it. At the launch price of $40 this is not worth it. I did enjoy my time with WOTC but it is basically just a basic DLC. I am actually very disappointed in TB whose recommendation encourage me to purchase this basic DLC at launch. It;s fun but compared to what you receive from the basic game plus what modders have provided it is worth no more that $20. If money is not an issue and you want to play Xcom 2 with more variety then absolutely buy this game, However, if you value your money wait for a 50% off sale.. This is a must-buy if you enjoyed XCOM 2. War of the Chosen adds new soldier classes, technology, and missions. There are new persistent enemies in the Chosen, new retaliation missions, resistance groups that add great flavor to the world, covert operations, soldier bonds, etc. I wish they'd paced things out a bit more though, the sheer amount of mechanics introduced at the start can be overwhelming even for XCOM vets, and I would not recommend this expansion for your first play-through. I would have liked to see some more tweaks to the main campaign, the final 1/3rd still feels like a forgone conclusion once you get your troopers up to god-tier, especially with the new extra ability unlocks. Ironman Commander Difficulty was not much of a challenge, and where I think they made the DLC ruler aliens too OP, I think the Chosen were a little bit under-powered. More story missions involving the Lost and more diversity in the Avatar facility missions would have also been welcome. I expect the Mod community to have a field-day with all of the new changes, and new campaign options allow you to customize the game to your experience. I'll be back in another month for my Legend Ironman playthrough, wish me luck!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Very good game. I played it on veteran iron man and made it through, just. Cant wait for xcom 3. But please give the characters more personality, and make some of the blood real red. thx. Original Xcom 2 had so many issues on my PC, so I couldn't play it. Freezes, weird sound glitches, constant crushes... This is the only game that works so bad on my PC. Only! When DLS was out I decided to make another try on this game. Nothing fixed! Even infamous crush after tutorial is still there! Just great.. Great expansion. Dont listen to the few reviewers saying this isnt worth the price. This expansion completely changes the game. If youre an xcom fan try it for yourself. Thats all i can say.. The X-com series went to garbage after the did WITHIN; X-Com2 is nothing but repeated garbage with timed missions now. If it's anything I hate it's timed anything. I want to be free to make tactical decisions without being rushed by a timer. This is what ruined Dungeoneering and this is what ruined the X-Com series after WITHIN.. Let me say first, know what you're buying. This expansion works more like a supercharged DLC than a true expansion. Don't get me wrong there is a lot of new content, but none of it extends the original ending of the game and it becomes bloated at various points in the game (more on this later). So lets get to the meat of it. This expansion is all about three new bosses (chosen) and making you hate them. X-Com has never been much **** with ""bosses"", so it feels a little out of place, too Hollywood for a game that once was a pretty gritty and realistic strategy game. These over the top, trash talking bosses could be great if used more subtly, but Firaxis shoves them down your throat. They pop up to tell you how weak and doomed you are at any given point. They die, reappear, only to come back stronger. They would be great for a cinematic game like Metal Gear, not in a strategy game. Now lets move onto the ridiculous power of these bosses. They get to move, attack, move in battle. Can summon Advent out of thin air. They automatically hit (defense is irrelevant, they'll hit y","XCOM 2 is a turn-based tactical strategy game with squad management and base-building mechanics . this dynamic combat puzzle features ruthless enemies with intelligent AI who show no mercy to the player . player choice, customization, and mission variety have been greatly expanded . the lore is enhanced by the addition of new hero classes and enemies ."
51.Final Fantasy IX,"Easily my favorite and most nostalgic Final Fantasy. I prefer the stylized Fantasy setting over the ""realism"" that is in FF8 or FF7. Combat system is simple but rewarding. The story will keep you interested throughout. Probably some of the most unique characters of any FF game IMO. The music is extremely good and helps to give each location and story beat a very unique feel. 10/10 Overall!. A masterpiece in every aspect, capable of immersing you in an exciting story with interesting development and gameplay. Everybody should play this game at least once in their life.. Best game ever made. Story, music, art, characters... All is 10/10. In really hope for a Remake.. One of the best games in history imo, even after finishing Rebirth, and loving the modern entries and remakes a lot. This game still holds up, so I just wanted to give it credit once more, FF IX is a special game. 10/10 from me.. The Final Fantasy Love Letter. The perfect end to the best FF generation. We love Vivi.. Final Fantasy IX is one of the only games in this series I checked out before the marathon, therefore I knew there was going to be a little bias. While I adore the characters, and setting, despite being limited to mostly one continent in terms of civilisation, you can tell certain elements of the 2nd half are rushed. Furthermore, the combat while initially engaging made some poor choices when it comes to stat squishing and the trance feature, which goes away after each fight. Music is the best the series has had, and while I have issues with where the story went, this game has some relatively strong core characters, Freya and Amarant not withstanding. Overall, it’s a partially flawed experience however one that at least sticks the landing emotionally, even if all the pieces are not there. The ending did and will always make me weep.Show less. My favorite game of all time.Absolute masterpiece 10/10 Thank you Square Soft.... The first half of the game (Disc 1 and half of Disc 2) was much better for me. It had a strong start with good characters, charm, and humor. But after a while, the story becomes pretty banal and clichéd (though, to be fair, the game is from 2000, so what can you expect). The gameplay also feels like a step back compared to Final Fantasy VII. The animations are too slow, and the battles are too easy and generic. I only played it because people say it’s the best Final Fantasy game. For me, it’s definitely not. It’s a solid Final Fantasy game, but it doesn’t measure up to 6, 7 and 10.. The most fun game in my life, a classic among classicsI played it more than 5 times. This is definitely one of my favourite FF. The game imo is a piece of art, loved it from the start to the end. The music in the game is perfect and it compliments to its world and characters very much. Vivi forever.. Final Fantasy IX: A Timeless Journey Through Nostalgia and Innovation Story and Setting Final Fantasy IX transports players to the enchanting world of Gaia, a realm brimming with medieval aesthetics, whimsical creatures, and fantastical landscapes. The narrative follows the charming thief Zidane Tribal and his eclectic group of companions as they uncover a plot to conquer the world. Themes of identity, destiny, and existentialism are intricately woven into the storyline, creating a rich tapestry that resonates deeply with players. Characters One of Final Fantasy IX’s greatest strengths lies in its memorable cast. From the introspective black mage Vivi to the strong-willed princess Garnet, each character is meticulously crafted with their own unique arcs and personalities. The interplay between these characters is both heartfelt and humorous, making their journey feel genuine and compelling. Gameplay The game employs a traditional turn-based combat system, enhanced by the Active Time Battle (ATB) gauge that adds a layer of strategic depth. Each character has distinct abilities tied to their equipment, encouraging players to experiment with different gear combinations. The Trance system, which temporarily boosts a character’s abilities when their Trance gauge is full, adds another strategic element to battles. Exploration is rewarding, with diverse environments ranging from bustling cities to eerie forests. Side quests and mini-games, such as the addictive Tetra Master card game, offer ample distractions from the main quest. The game’s pacing balances story progression and exploration, ensuring a consistently engaging experience. Visuals and Sound Final Fantasy IX’s visuals are a blend of charming, pre-rendered backgrounds and polygonal characters. While the graphics may seem dated compared to modern standards, the art direction imbues the game with a timeless, storybook quality. The character designs by Yoshitaka Amano are both whimsical and iconic. Nobuo Uematsu’s masterful soundtrack is arguably one of the best in the series. The music perfectly complements the game’s emotional and narrative beats, from the serene melodies of the overworld to the intense themes of boss battles. Overall Impressions Final Fantasy IX is a heartfelt love letter to the classic era of RPGs. Its engaging story, memorable characters, and intricate gameplay mechanics offer a rich, fulfilling experience that stands the test of time. Whether you’re a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, this game offers a captivating journey that is well worth embarking on. Rating: 10/10 In summary, Final Fantasy IX is a beautifully crafted game that blends nostalgia with innovative gameplay, creating an adventure that remains one of the finest in the series.. Whenever I think of an immersive, epic medieval fantasy adventure, ff9 is the first thing that comes to mind. Probably the best JPRG of its time and one of the best Final Fantasy series! The story is tragic, the soundtrack is fantastic, the characters grow to the heart! If you like a turn-based combat system, you should definitely take a look at the whole thing. I love it!. This is the greatest game ever made. I can’t wait for the remake. Hope that it’s not split up like ff7. It'ssimply the best game I have ever played in my life. None has this beautiful story. It was nice to play this now! I really appreciate the storytelling and the soundtrack.. Good graphic Good story Good gameplay Good side quest Maybe less content than FF7 but still a must play. i love this game more than the previous series like seven and eight .. its so good, remind me of the the old final fantasy especially the GOAT six. I love Final Fantasy IX! It's my favorite Final Fantasy game ever as well as my favorite PlayStation game ever. Okay sure, the game has its imperfections like the Trance system, the battle speed, and the fact that it's mandatory to beat the Tetra Master card game tournament as you progress in the game. That said, what's great about this game by far outweighs its imperfections. In my opinion, Final Fantasy IX is a masterpiece, it's an inspiring game with memorable characters like Zidane and Vivi. Not only were Zidane and Vivi fun to play as, but so were Garnet, Steiner, Freya, Quina, Eiko, and Amarant. I know some of the characters hardly have anything to do with the story like Quina and Amarant, but that's pretty much every Final Fantasy game in a nutshell. This game also has interesting antagonists like Kuja and Garland. One of the things I enjoy about this game in particular is the fact that it's straightforward with its character job classes and that makes planning which characters I want to use in my party for whatever situation not too complicated to deal with. My memory recalls immersing myself into the captivating fictional world of Final Fantasy IX. I also fondly remember always listening to its beautiful and relaxing music soundtrack. The battle theme of this game in my opinion is the best in the series. Also, this game helped me get through tough times. The theme that always stood out to me besides you not being alone was the will to fight and survive. Exploring all the places in this beautiful game and collecting all the items gave me a great sense of adventure.. Absolute masterpiece, the pinnacle of what defines Final Fantasy as a series.. It's only fun the first time. It's a worse version of ff8 (especially the card game). At the end of the first disc, the game starts to get boring, and the story just ridiculous. However, the leveling of skills is very well done and makes you want to have them all.. My favorite game of all time. I play it annually. It holds a very special place in my heart.. Greatest game ever! Even to this day this game is still one of the best games that I have ever seen!. One of my favorite final fantasys. Im not a fan of the turn based battle system, but the story more than makes up for it. It's an average final fantasy game. Good enough to play, but definitely not a masterpiece or anywhere near what 7 and 10 were. greatest of all time. This game doesn't need a remake, all they'll do is add below average voice acting and get rid of all choices. A return to the classic Final Fantasy setting, and was another masterpiece just like Final Fantasy 7 before it.. People still get sad over what's essentially a magic construct's story in this game. Also probably the last time heists in video games were cool.. Final Fantasy IX is a gem! It will probably always be my favorite video game. Touching, engaging story, colorful characters, and of course music made this game perfect. The gameplay itself has been polished to perfection. Square gave this game a lot of heart.. This game was part of my childhood... If I could rate it 1000 I would. Story, characters, gameplay, music, scenarios are wonderful! The only downside is the platinum requirements... jumping rope 1000 times is ridiculous! But that doesn't take away the shine of this wonderful jrpg. Easily the best Final Fantasy. Great story and characters. Fun combat and world. Masterpiece.. The best Final Fantasy ever made. The story is good, the music is incredible and the characters are charismatic. the game has a perfect balance of drama and humor.. So, let's make everybody hate me: I do not like this FF, i though i liked back in the 2000 but now i got boring playing it. First i will say what i liked: >I Love Vivi and Vivi's story, easily my favorite thing of the game. >For a 2000 game i think the presentation is 10/10, scenarios are beautifully made and the FMV are spectacular for PS1 gen. >I like the Tetra Master minigame. >I like the Ability Stones system. And what i don't like: >I HATE the Limit Break replacement (Trance); It's so random and irregular; they trigger in the most mundane moment, most of them are just lame and static, they don't evolve. Meanwhile the Zidane one is brokenly OP. >The game is so easy it get boring, the only part when i feel in danger was the mere beginning, simply because your party is incomplete and the character have nothing yet, once you get to disc 3, is just a walk. >Story is not bad, but i hate that they make a spectacular destruction (pretty much a nuke) in a cutscene but then everybody is ok? Feels so cheese. >I hate Quina, it's a dumb and unappealing character, and to make it even worse... It's the Blue Mage of the party. BM are one of my favorite jobs/classes cause you have to actively look for the spells to grow the character. One of the most awesome class behind the worse character of the game. >And finally i think the game feels slow. It start strong on me, nostalgia on 100%, but the more i play, the less i want to keep playing it.. A unique work, one of the best to date. This game will definitely enter the top, created by a diverse, experienced, versatile and not envious gamer. A legend for a real dreamer. From Gabranth with Love.. My second favorite Final Fantasy and my second favorite video game of all time. Absolute classic. Great story, visuals and OST. Must play if a fan of JRPGs.. My favorite Final Fantasy with a charming cast of characters with classic turn based combat. It has some of the best cutscenes of all the Ps1 Final Fantasy games.. The most underrated Final Fantasy to have ever been made It has good story, very likeable characters amazing graphics and an even more amazing soundtrack.. worth it and glad to play this game again. so much memories and nostalgia within this nineth game in the series.. I really love this game. It makes me feel so warm and comfy to play. The humor is great, the world is great, the characters are so loveable, the score is magnificent. Its just a really well made game. Square Soft sort of effortlessly pushed out these types of games during their golden age. I do think, however, that it is somewhat devoid of the innovation and magnificence **** like Final Fantasy 7. This is a simpler title, one that actually went back and took elements of previous final fantasy's in terms of both gameplay and world building. I appreciate that, but it doesnt push the envelope in any way, nor does it quite reach the heights **** like FF7 in terms of story telling, world building, character design, so on.. While many people say that FF7 was the best game of the series, for me its cleartly this masterpiece. While the game look cartoonish, the story gets very dark.. One ofthe best games every created. Classic. This FF should get remake. Srsly.. Must Play definitely!!! One of the Best RPG games of all time! Have a fun!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Best RPG ever made, the golden age of role playing, rip square soft forever. Before moving on to a new generation, Final Fantasy IX gave players one last go with a traditional Final Fantasy experience, and it did not disappoint. With a more fairy tale-like tone and aesthetic, Final Fantasy IX oozes with irresistible charm, and it encapsulates better than any other installment what made the entire franchise up to that point so special. Final Fantasy IX is yet another high point for the franchise.. My favorite Final Fantasy of all time, and it righteously deserves to be one of the greatest JRPGs of all time. Colorful cast of characters, and they are likable with depth storylines and backgrounds. The OST is one of the finest in the FF series with ""Melodies of Life,"" ""Unfathomed Reminiscence,"" and ""Loss of Me."" Along with ""You're Not Alone"" and ""Eiko's Theme."" Great use of the Chocobo Hot 'N'Cold minigame, and the Triad minigame is not bad -- only VIII's is superior. The dialogue between characters is both cute and humorous. The Eidolons' (summons) animations are also fun to watch. Trance Mode is fun to experience during gameplay. Also enjoyed the active time sequence events, and the CGI was great for its time. Highly recommend.. Top 3 favorite final fantasy games out of the 13+ ive beaten, amazing character building and vivi is GOD tier.. After a number of entries that shaked up the series' formula to test new mechanics and features FF9 takes the series back to its roots, both in terms of setting and gameplay. In Combat, we are back to an efficient simplicity: each party member has its own set of skills and equipment that are exclusive to them, giving each character their distinct flavour. The only innovation comes in the form of Abilities: Abilities can provide new action commands or add passive effects on characters. They can be acquired through weapons: fight enough times with a weapon and the Ability linked to said weapon will be available permanently. This mechanic can be quite addicting: trying to find every Ability and see them gain experience to become permanent tickles that completionist part of the human brain, but sadly this feature doesn't go much farther than that: collecting Abilities is way more satisfying than actually using them. Most are minimal and offer such a superficial novelty that they hardly ever change the way you look at battles like Materia did in FF7. Materia also gave the player incredible creative freedom to craft custom builds based on countless hidden synergies with the Materia slots on weapons, whereas Abilities in FF9 have way less potential and work indipendently, suffocating any room for experimentation. The Ability System isn't downright awful, mind you, but Materia in FF7 showed us what an excellent Skill System could be and FF9's System is just decent by comparison. Materia System and Ability System have one, negative thing in common: they both make their game too easy. Truth be told, FF9 is such an improvement on this. FF7 and 8 were just too easy to the point of boredom, while FF9 is a pleasantly challenging game... until you discover 3 specific Abilities that completely destroy almost all challenge within the main story. It's such a shame because if these 3 Abilities were nerfed the level of challenge would've remained optimal. Another huge improvement regarding Combat concerns its frequency: the enemy encounter rate has been significantly lowered, making the entire experience way more user friendly. But, as if to balance this, combat speed has tremendously worsened. The ATB bar moves at a snail's pace, characters take a whole second before deciding to act and Summons are as long as ever: battles in FF9 are excruciatingly slow, worse than ever. Let's talk about gameplay outside of battles. Final Fantasy is a series famous for its worlds brimming of optional content to discover, and Final Fantasy 9 is no different: full of secret areas, side-quests, activities, minigames and juicy treasure chests hidden at every corner, ready to be discovered by those who are willing to explore everything that this beautiful game has to offer. Maybe not the richest display of minigames and secret Bosses of the series, but certainly not disappointing. The Card Game idea from FF8 makes a return, except way worse. Ironically, one of the few good things of FF8, makes a return only to become one of the few bad things about FF9. Not only this time around it lacks any involvement with the main gameplay, but the game's rules are so unnecessarily complicated that it just becomes frustrating. So, the gameplay is pretty much average for a Final Fantasy game, let's get on the narrative. The story of FF9 starts off with a dynamic blast, and manages to keep that exciting momentum almost all the way through, stuttering a bit only in the second act. It doesn't go for a simple road-movie approach like FF7, but it doesn't clobber the viewer with plotpoints and plot-twist without rest like FF8 either. There's always something happening, even multiple plot-lines going on at the same time, but it's all paced and structured so that the characters have still plenty of room to breathe and showcase their development to the player. Speaking of characters, FF9 has four protagonists, and it is incredible how believable their growth is throughout the game. Influencing each other, they change and decide what they intend to do with the life they were given, creating some of the most emotional character arcs that this series has ever seen (even though one character's arc overlaps with another one's in a pretty redundant way). The problem is that FF9 doesn't have four protagonists. It actually has eight. But those other four are some of the most forgettable party members you'll ever see. Either existing just to be a comic relief, having a subplot that goes nowhere, or joining the protagonist for no reason other than being in the boxart. It's almost jarring to see these bland characters coexisting with the aforementioned spectacular ones. Or, in other words: Final Fantasy 9 has, all highs and lows considered, a pretty average gameplay elevated by its plethora of secrets and optional content, and an excellent story that despite some abysmally boring characters, offers some of the best character arcs of this entire series.. Final Fantasy IX is simply the game with one of the best stories I've had the opportunity to enjoy. Given the limitations of the time, the game is still very pleasant to play mainly because of the plot.. A true masterpiece, I recommend people not to be fooled by its artistic appearance, the story is very emotional and good, it does not fall into the pretentious or superficial. FF7 and FF8 are very good games, but I don't think they are comparable to this game.. Simply a beautiful game, the music, the carachters and the story makes it unforgettable.... Well done game that was brought back to the Final Fantasy roots of it all. For me personally, Zidane is not one of my fav. protagonist but the rest of the game was great. Besides, he is better that Vaan lol.. It's not a bad game, there's a lot of qualities, but also it's not a masterpiece. Characters are very too cringe sometimes and not at the level of the seriousness of Final Fantasy Saga. Glad to a return in the medieval fantasy, but it's not enough.. For me this is the best game ever created the music the characters, the events, chocobo treasure hunts, I can't describe how much this game have influenced me. Masterpiece. Just like FF4 this game is totally underrated. The atmosphere/ environments are my favourite in the whole franchise and when you add the great plot to it the effects are amazing. The characters as always are great and so too is the soundtrack. The only issue I have with the game is the slow combat speed making battles last very long. It's not enough to drop the overall score though.. Truly takes you on a journey, the music, the characters, the story, truly a timeless masterpiece.. Brilliant. Simply one of the best RPGs I've ever played. Good narrative, good character development.. Much like its cousin Chrono Cross, Final Fantasy IX exists in a bubble. Debuting at the end of a fading console, it didn't resurge until more modern times of social media and video content. With its core message being that of ""belonging"", Final Fantasy IX is more relevant to modern social culture than it was at launch. Pros: Strong core message Fundamental JRPG that is fairly balanced (some exceptions) Variety of side content and challenges The last purely composed Nobuo Uematsu soundtrack. Cons: Regressive gameplay compared to previous games. Despite having a variety (character skills*), the overlap makes most of them redundant to use in game outside of investigating. *Two characters are even White Mage-Summoner class. (Look at FF5 Jobs, or FF6 character variety. This comes across as lazy.) Several characters and locations become extremely irrelevant to overall story. I would argue a new player could reasonably start at disc 3 and not miss much context from the first half the game. Most locations visited from the first half of the game are even locked away due to disc limitations, unless they have a key item. Despite having a variety of side content, a lot of it is simply for padding time and not particularly beneficial or interesting, with some challenges being outright broken or intentionally malicious (Jump Rope). Conclusion: Saved by a good overall message and the soundtrack; FFIX is a solid JRPG that I find is a bit overrated by its devoted fans.. FFIX means so much to me. My favorite game of time. The characters in this taught me lessons I still remember today. Loyalty, friendship, honor. You’re not alone! Shout out to THE MAN Nobuo Uematsu.. This game is a gem. It's my favorite game of all times. I love everything in this game. Absolutely wonderful story, great characters (Vivi!), amazing soundtrack, the battle system is so good as well.... A somehow unrecognized but excellent entry in the Final Fantasy franchise. Maybe it was because the game came relatively late in the lifetime of the original PlayStation and attention was focused on the PlayStation 2. For itself it was a back to the roots entry. More fantasy and less steampunk. The story is set in the world Gaia and starts with our protagonist Zidane a member of a band of thieves called Tantalus on a mission to capture the princess of Alexandria. Sounds like a fantasy cliche but they cleverly subvert the trope as the princess wants to escape from Alexandria as well and this is just the beginning of an interesting story. There are a lot of twist and some hit hard at the characters and players. It was entertaining, immersive and had lots of humor. It handles themes like individuality, souls or what does it mean to be alive instead of just existing, corruption by power and plots I cant spoil. It delivers from start to finish. The characters are unique and have their own personality and backstory. I especially liked Vivi, Freya, Zorn and Torn and others I cant spoil. The villains are superb and have clear believable motivations. Also the playable characters are in a fixed role / job. The main character is a thief and has a set of related skills. Other are white mage (healer), black mage (elemental damage) or knights etc. This works well for me and makes sense but can be seen as restrictive by others. Abilities can be learned through equipping items and earn enough experience. If you learned it completely you can use the skill without the item. Of cause there are abilities that only a certain character can learn. Only the white mage can heal with spells or the black mage can use elemental magic. There are two types of abilities. Direct abilities for each character to use and supporting abilities. For the later you have a (level increasing) pool of points to spend and must chose or adapt according to situations. The battle system works well and I like to experiment with different party combinations. There is a new mechanic in the game called Active Time Events (ATE). Here you can chose to view events in other locations (Other characters, special events etc.) While I am at it I will give you some tips: Keep one of the weakest available weapons for each character. You read this correct: Weakest and each character. The haste ability is the best support ability in the game and should always be used. It is an advantage to have more turns than your enemies (Except when confused or charmed). Some ATEs have benefits and you should read a missable stuff / events FAQ. Let at least one female and male frog alive in each lake. End of tips. There is a card game inside this called Tetra Master. While I enjoyed it it was also forgotten and rediscovered by me that it existed. There are other mini games and side activities for you to play. The graphic and soundtrack are amazing. Look how much the graphic has improved since Final Fantasy 7. It has the best soundtrack of all Final Fantasy games for me (tied with Final Fantasy Tactics). “You are not alone” (used to full potential in a great scene), “The dark messenger”, This place I’ll return someday” and “Festival of Hunt” to name a few are excellent. There are some minor flaws as no perfect game exists. There is a certain battle after some events that is unnecessary and a failure in story telling (I am vague because of spoilers). It was a complaint by many. Other stuff is just to small to mention. Overall this is a highlight in the franchise and nearly unrecognized by Final Fantasy standards. I would recommend it not only to Final Fantasy fans as it is a great experience.. A perfect masterpiece. There is no other way I could describe what this game is.. My favourite Final Fantasy game. A tale about the meaning of the life. Great characters. Spoiler: you will cry several times.. Best Final Fantasy Game. A real RPG, with a very clever skill system, a great storyline, wonderful graphics (not only for PS one) and the best soundtrack of all games of all time.. An excellent, cartoonish and fabulous JRPG with a great message and morality. Interesting pumping system. Impressive supporting characters and a standard yet good soundtrack.. First off, I just want to say, as a fan of JRPGs, the built-in speedhack of the Steam version is nearly essential. This game is old-skool as **** and it helps with grinding. That said, it's a wonderful game with fantastic characters and story. Play it.. This is THE RPG. Period. No game will ever match the beauty of this gem. Even today, even in a million years, no game will ever be able to match FFIX.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The Perfect Game. It's very funny. Have best characters in games ever!!!!!!. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. My favorite game so far it has a perfect story and an unforgettable soundtrack. i must say that this is the ultimate final fantasy, place that shares of course with VI and VII. It is incredible how squaresoft actually could make this awesome game for the PS one. A must play, and a close to perfection game. very good game, strong emotional of charcters, music so beautyfull and the boss ozma .. The best Final Fantasy to date. Beautiful world, amazing cast of characters and a gorgeous return to a fairy tale and knighthood setting. Final Fantasy IX is the best in the series. Many people will praise this game like it is the ""bestest game evaaar"". Those people are lying to you. This game is beautiful, it is fun, but it is by no means amazing. It is far to linear, forcing you down one track and never letting you explore or become the characters you are playing. It has gorgeous cutscenes but the gameplay itself is a bit lackluster. Overall, just ok.. Apart from things like the time you get the weapons you have been waiting for or that you just have to farm a lot with some of them to get great abilities, the game is a masterpiece. The story and the characters are amazing; the visuals are great for a game released in 2000, and the music is wonderful too. The game also makes you think a lot, since each character has his own way of thinking and seeing life, making it really interesting to read the dialogues. After playing it, how can you not fall in love with this game?. This quite literally would be a perfect Final Fantasy game if not for the fact that it is a bit sloppy in battles (probably because 4 character party) and well... while setting has its undieniable charm, I like 7 and 8 much more, but thats more of a personal opinion. I suppose summons could be more exciting as well. But overall, its a wonderful game.. It’s an absolute amazing game. It has good Soundtracks, awesome Characters, awesome story and much more. In that Game you will feal all kind of Emotion. It’s funny, sad, dramatic... For me it’s the best Final Fantasy and verry good to be you’re first Final Fantasy. It’s an absolute must play.. The ninth mainline entry in the JPRG series centres on war between nations in a fantasy world called Gaia. When a bandit known as Zidane Tribal kidnaps an Alexandrian princess he finds himself on a quest to take down her mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria, who started the war. The plot and characters aren’t as memorable as previous instalments, but with it’s complex turn based combat and huge world to explore, this remains a thoroughly enjoyable RPG even to this day. If you were a fan of the series to this point, Final Fantasy IX won’t disappoint.. The last and the best PlayStation Final Fantasy. It's a better game then the legendarny VII. It simply wasn't the first one, the game-changer.. Didn't really like the childish fairy tale vibe. I prefer Final Fantasy games to be more on the serious and futuristic note, like FF6, FF7, FF8 or even FF13 or FF15. Nothing memorable in this game for me.. A master piece. The best JRPG ever made. The story, the music, the art and the gameplay are perfect. The game all the other jrpgs should compare themselves to.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Played on PlayStation. Gameplay: GREAT. Story: GREAT. Graphic: GREAT. Music/Sound: GREAT. Dialogue: GREAT.. I own and have beaten every Final Fantasy they have made for the mainline and i have to say this is my personal favorite in the series.. This game doesn't get the praise it deserves. It's beautifully made, it's entertaining, has a wonderful soundtrack and the history is great. The dialogue can feel a little childish sometimes, but it's still a must play RPG.. FIrst FF game I ever playe","Easily my favorite and most nostalgic Final Fantasy . a masterpiece in every aspect, capable of immersing you in an exciting story . combat system is simple but rewarding ."
510.DUSK,"Having grown up on some of the OG FPS' like Duke Nukem and Unreal, this is a blast to play.. Pretty cool and gory, but gets old very quickly. Ultrakill is made by the same people, and is much, much better.. I know it's inspired by quake, but it's very far away, the gameplay, the character control, the bad guys look like a poorly made horror movie, the atmosphere and sound, far below Quake and it's a game that came out 20 years later.. It's a cool game. Pros.: - Old-school vibe and aesthetics. - References to Quake (first one) and Blood. - Creative levels. Especially in Episode 3. - Plenty of secrets. Cons.: - IDK. Most of the things are cool. Music is fine. Probably, sounds are too primitive sometimes.. really good retro movment shooter the soundtrack is great. Great boomer shooter. Big variety of weapons, memorable enemies and levels. This is clearly a work of passion and talent, everything pieces together perfectly. If you feel like you might like it from the trailer you will most definitely love it, it's pretty straight forward. I had to cut one point because there are parts of the game that didn't click for me. Sometimes I got lost in the level and wasn't sure how to progress, but not for long fortunately. The flipping mechanic is very confusing with the perspective change on the camera. There were also certain spots where the enemies would get stuck, but not too many. These are all just nitpicks. This game is absolutely gorgeous.. Eh it's pretty fun to just shoot a couple shots, it needs to rely a lot on nostalgia effect. The OST is great.. This is a game that has to be played to understand why the reviews are so high. I watched videos and thought it looked neat, but it wasn’t really pulling me in. It sat in my library for over a year, and within 5 minutes of experiencing it, I understood. A couple days later, I finished the game, and what a wonderful treat for people who grew up with the original Quake. This game seriously captures the same energy of Quake without making the formula feel in any way dated. The gameplay is very simple, but it’s a nice refreshing throwback to when games required the fast paced run and gun movement rather than relying on cover. Where I think the game really shines is the atmosphere - who would have ever thought that this game with its intentionally retro graphics and play style would have a creepier atmosphere than many modern horror games. The initial part of the game gave me the atmospheric feeling of Resident Evil 4, except better. Some of the later sections of the game are truly unsettling. Between the beautiful yet extremely simple graphics and the phenomenal sound design, it helps tell the story of the game without the game actually having much of an overt story at all. Everything is told through the atmosphere and level design. It was actually pretty fun guessing what was going on and trying to create a story for yourself, since there is hardly any written or spoken dialogue. The sound design in this game is fantastic, a master in its class and it outsides most major modern horror games - especially some of the settings in the later portions of the game. It’s a pretty challenging game, but its highly rewarding. While it got frustrating at times, the satisfaction of pushing through a level and completing it after multiple tries was something I rarely experience in games anymore. The only flaw I would say is regarding some of the level design, which is true to the classic genre, but it didn’t age the best. I found myself lost pretty regularly because a lot of the textures and buildings look the same. Sometimes it allowed for some fun exploration, other times I was just running around for several minutes unable to figure out where I last saw something. There are a few really dark levels that were particularly irritating because of how difficult it was to find your way around. Overall, this is an excellent game that I think fans of the classics and modern shooter fans can both enjoy all the same. Everything this game sets out to do it excels at.. Incredible indie game, it has a high resemblance to DOOM, even the keys, red, yellow and blue are present. I love the originality of this game! Engaging and haunting soundtrack, horror/horror game is only really good when it has these 90s graphics, I also love the amount of bodies that are on the ground, the violence, an almost perfect game!. This is one of the best FPS games ever made. Absolute GOAT of the retro shooter genre, in my humble opinion, and I would even argue one of the best games in the FPS genre at all. If you love Quake, this game takes a lot of inspiration from that, but has increased weapon and enemy variety. The level design can be downright inspired, and I don't think there's a bad level in the entire game. Do yourself a favor and play this game.. One of the best boomer shooters out there. Imagine the original doom modernized, and cranked the action and horror to 11, and add half-life 2 physics. The weapons are pretty good and you use all of them pretty frequently and the enemies are very creative and fun to fight against, and the levels constantly innovate on the previous one to keep it fresh. The boss fights are the only part of the game that i wish was better. Everything was put together really well, but... Episode 1 is great, Episode 2 is fine, Episode is mostly good. Levels are either the size of a stadium or a McDonald's playplace. Gunfights are fun, that grenade launcher Weapon is awkward to use. I believe a 7/10 is good, but metacritic doesn't.. This game is pretty cool and pretty sick. Feel free to save like you would in Skyrim, or to bump the difficulty down, it's going for that frantic Quake/Doom combat, and sometimes it can get quite tuff. Sometimes it has meme or meme-like humor instead of taking itself seriously, and there is often cheesy metal playing, I would have liked less of that. The overall art style is fantastic, the Wendigo enemies are one of my favorite designs in any videogame, and it also features some great ambient tracks.. Growing up with Doom and Quake it was a fantastic throwback to the old shooters. Level design was clever you always knew where you had to go and I never got lost. Weapons were fun to use and movement fluid. It reminded me how fun those games were.. This game is fantastic. For what it is, I have zero faults with it. Plays like a dream, and is one of the best ""retro"" shooters ever even though it definitively benefits from modern game design and whatnot.. This game is the reason I became hooked on the retro shooter trend. Initially I was drawn to it by a promise of a shooter soaked in a dark, lovecraftian vibe. Little did I know how thoroughly the game would deliver that premise and more. This game had some of the most well designed levels i've ever played in a shooter, transporting the player to genuine hellscapes and reality bending planes. While the other aspects of the game may not be the most unique, the level design alone for some of these spectacles is worth the price of entry.. Probably the most fun and entertaining movement shooter i ever played, rivals even doom when it comes to the fun aspect. best game ever idk they say i have to make a longer review so idk... what should i do. Big john my beloved, if you haven't played over half the game then you haven't seen what the game has to offer. 10/10. The movement in DUSK is beautiful, the gunplay is very nice and has a super shotgun that would make DOOM II's SSG proud and the soundtrack of DUSK made by Andrew Hulshult is just beautiful. Honestly outta all the amazing games to come from New Blood interactive, DUSK is a great starting point before moving on to their other titles.. play the video game or else i will find you and i will stretch out my review to reach 75 characters. This is a very well made retro FPS. Fast, smooth, diverse. Great music. Simple but satisfying.. Boring and bland. got passed ep 1, and the only thing I got out of that was mild motion sickness. It's suppose to be a doom shooter but I don't see what the fuss is about with this game. it's a hard pass for me.. Coming from a fan of single player shooters - this got to be one of my favorite games in... probably the past 10 years. Just after Borderlands 2 and easily before Doom 4. But what those games so often missed on was focusing on the purest form of the shooting. It takes only a brutally direct and fast controls to be able to really capture that immediacy and party-like feeling so typical for quake 3 of the past decades (and rare to find elsewhere). It was not very obvious in the first part of the game - but it gradually got more and more impressive for me. Actually the first moment, I felt that vibe of a superb shooting game, in both mechanics and level design, was towards the end of the first episode - the city map. Before that I mostly felt the game is very good, but didn't really capture the true presence in the stations. They really get even further in the second episode. Real map variety, great level design and absolutely tremendous enemy and awards placements. At some point I was even wondering how did they make it so smooth. What does it really take to have such success and the overall level and difficulty planning and why so much other fail so bad at this? A truly gem **** which remind us all that even the simplest graphics can deliver a memorable experience, if all the other boxes are checked. Don't waste your time with the big blockbusters before playing this one.. Very enjoyable game. Fantastic old-school shooter clone. I have nothing bad to really say about it tbh. it's just really great. I'm more excited to see what they do next tbh. these guys have heaps of talent. I wish, maybe, the multiplayer had more servers up and running. I haven't checked out the communities maps yet. Either way, good game.. One of my all time fav games. Amazing gameplay, music, secrets and story. David really killed it with this game and it will be hard to top. If you haven't played this yet, then I suggest you do it. You won't regret it if you love oldschool FPS games. Pickens approves!. Dusk is an amazing game. Probably the best shooter in quite a while and upon finishing it I think I actually enjoyed it more than both Doom and Doom Eternal. Dusk is simply pure fun and reminds me of the games I played growing up. It was good enough to be the first review I've done on Steam, so if you have any love for retro shooters, buy it, you won't regret it.. Thrilling classic shooter gameplay, grungy visuals and heavy atmosphere make this game an extremely fun experience. Some portions are surely frustrating due to lackluster level and busted encounter designs, but memories of them will stick with you alongside overwhelmingly positive ones. There's also a designated weapon spin button that serves as a placeholder for the absent reload, so you know the game is awesome.. This one was a surprise! A love letter to Doom, Hexen, Heretic, and Quake, it is lots of bloody fun and a phenomenal original soundtrack.. Amazing gameplay, Amazing in-game sounds, Amazing music, Very clever level designs, A unique experience, And only for 15 bucks?! I just can't see a reason not to buy it It's Just Great.. If you like the old Doom and Quake Games, you will absolutely love this! Hands down, one of the best games i played so far this year!. Hard to even find something wrong with this game. A true evolution of classic twitch shooters in modern times. It seems like a lot of people judge how good a games graphics are by how many polygons you can shove into it, this game is archaic by no means except for it's aesthetic. The art direction is superb and continues to ramp up until it's peak in episode 3. Game play is the center focus and it shows, the tools the game provides you for both movement and dispatching enemies allows for some really creative approaches to winning a fight. DUSK is by no means a cheap recreation of old classics as some would suggest. The fluidity of the game play undoubtedly leaves older titles in the dirt, and the game is chock-full of originality, though it often pays homage to older games to a comedic extent. I find the level design to be a step up from it's predecessors as well. DOOM Eternal is 60$, not very long, although the level design isn't bad I prefer DUSK's, and if interrupting the game play to watch a kill cut-scene for HP wasn't counter-intuitive enough in DOOM 2016, now you can do it for armor and ammo too. Enter DUSK, which is 20$, has more content, actual versus multiplayer, upcoming campaign co-op, already has mod support, and in my honest opinion, is outright a better game.. Good FPS shooter with older graphics, a killer soundtrack, and smooth gameplay. Every chapter gives you something new so the game gives you new mechanics, all the way to the last chapter. The game has replayability because there are lots of secrets to find. Keep in mind that this game can be difficult on the normal difficulty which I was surprised. The game wants you to keep moving all the time and even thou there are usually couple enemies per room you will counter bigger arenas which reminded me of Doom and Quake with little bit more horror elements, nice! I think this game is underrated so if you are looking something unique give it a shot!. Repetitive, archaic and boring shooter. Don't get where all the hype comes from.. Dusk hearkens back to retro shooters of yore, an ode to those early days of 3D FPSs’. It takes a lot of inspiration by the likes of Doom, Half Life, Blood, and Quake. This is my first entry into old school but modern shooters, and all I can say is that I was very pleasantly, and unexpectedly surprised. What Dusk absolutely nails down is its incredible atmosphere. The music, the sounds, the levels just exude horror and a sense of dread. Couple that with some of the finest level design I’ve ever seen, Dusk will certainly put you right into the mood and give you that feeling of uneasiness from the moment you step foot into the first level. This game really encourages you to explore every nook and cranny, so that you can really appreciate and admire the level design, and of course, to stumble on those really hard to find secrets. When you’re getting into a fight, you’re just runnin’ around blastin’ away at enemies while dodging everything they throw at you. It’s just awesome. My only complaint are the enemies/bosses. Enemies will just run up to you for an easy kill, and bosses are not even remotely challenging. I wish the enemies were smarter and made themselves harder to kill, and that bosses were a lot more engaging to fight. Dusk is just an awesome game. It’s fun, it’s horrifying, and best of all, it’s nostalgic. It’s very much worthy of the praise, and I highly recommend it. Get it!. Dusk is one of the best 90s like fps games and really makes you feel the agony of the main charatcer with great atmosphere many jump scares and a lot of strange but great sound effects that make it more immersive despite the non realistic **** story is fine ,not a masterpiece but good enough to accompany the gameplay witch is great, satisfying , challenging and makes feel nostalgia for the old shooters like doom and **** i could change something it would be the lack of autosaving and little bit more corresponsive controls.Overall DUSK is a very good game and i totally recommend it if are into this kind of creepy shooters. P.S. Great music too. Dusk the best fast paced old school shooter yet. the movement and gameplay are fantastic as is the horror element. The way the guns feel is just so satisfying. As for the story there's pretty much nothing to it but then look at doom. the level design is amazing and there are even parts where you need to used the light of your guns to see. the soundtrack was composed by Andrew Hulshult and man did he do a good job. the graphics look kinda potato but David Szymanski has done a great job of making it seem seamless. if you're into first person shooters this is a must play. Oh and try not to **** yourself when you see a wendigo for the first time.. 10/10, masterpiece. Blood, Quake, Redneck rampage, you can find everything here. There's no reason to write anything about this game, it's just the amazing. And additional thanks to Andrew Hulshult, he's music was amazing.. I'm usually a bit skeptical about games that are trying to speculate on nostalgic feelings of oldschool players, but this one turned out to be great.. I can't say enough good things about this game. It really scratches that 90s FPS itch. It's fast paced, brutal, creepy, has great exploration and secrets. It has everything you would want from a retro PC shooter. Great work!. The first episode was pretty good. It took me a while to get into it, but I was quite excited by around the 5th level. From there, the game just continues to grow. This has some of the best level design in the genre, building on and in a lot of ways surpassing the old guard. DUSK is sublime. Though the low poly graphics are not the most amazing in the world, there are a few moments in various levels that made me pause because of the visuals. The weapons aren't the most exciting, but they are functional and feel nice. The game really has you switching between most of your arsenal throughout each of the levels, which keeps things exciting and varied. The music is excellent. The sound is excellent. There isn't too much of a story but I did find myself genuinely intrigued by things as the second and third acts unraveled before me. I was downright excited about the little tiny shreds of plot the game threw out at the end of the third (and final) act. The mood and scenery is top notch - while it starts as a romp through slightly uninteresting backwoods areas, things quickly escalate towards the end of the first act and throughout the second and third. All in all, DUSK is a phenomenal game and worth every bit of the praise it has received. It truly does bear the torch of the FPS games of yore, and hopefully it inspires plenty of new games in the same vein over the next few years.. Overrated game that is only reviewing well due to nostalgia. If you want to play good classic FPS, just play games like the Classic Doom, Unreal or Quake.. This game is amazing and 100% deserves the Overwhelmingly Positive status it currently enjoys on Steam. The gameplay is fluid, fast, and fun, the weapons are varied and none are irrelevant, the monsters are creepy and the overall atmosphere of the game is super dark. I cut my teeth on Doom in the early 90s when I was 13 years old and it left a permanent mark on my brain. This game tickled all the right nostalgia centers while bringing a few new tricks all its own. And can we talk about the sound design for this game?? First of all, Andrew Hulshult deserves the Nobel Prize for the music he did for Dusk. No lie, there were several times during the game where I got chills from either the rising sense of dread or rising sense of hell yeah that the music was making me feel. Beyond that, enemies and environments make disturbing noises that will keep you leaning forward in your seat and the guns sound great when they're doing their thing. My one nitpick about this game is that most of the bosses are kind of meh. They're not awful or anything, just average. And average things can kind of stick out in a game that rocks as hard as this one. TLDR, Dusk is a fun as hell love letter to 90s FPS and the music is GOD TIER. I do love this game. It wasnt love at first site but it gave me everything ive missed for so long. Fantastic!. I've picked dusk once it became available on steam is final version (non early access) and before I even start talking about It, I must say it became one of my all time favorite indie shooters. Its not flawless, its not innovative but its a traditional shooter faithful to what all old gamers loved about classic shooters in PS2-Ps1 era. The game story is Lovecraftian, its mostly narrated through us seeing how the world shapes as we travel between locations, the episode 1 fairly introduces the player to the Dusk world and what is happening and what has happened and it progresses onward to explain more about story. Story is nothing special or complicated but it ends up with interesting surprises toward the midway and end of campaign. the best thing about Dusk is how responsive the controls are and how fluid the gunplay is! it feels good to literally surf around the map and kill waves and waves of enemies, once you have finished the game, i highly recommend play it on highest difficulties to enjoy some blood pumping action. Weapons are good, sometimes its annoying that you dont get to find some of the weapons at some parts of games, and absence of Weapon wheel is also kinda annoying, I get the game tries to be what old games were like but some aspects are just very dated and straight up annoying, I hope at least they add weapon wheel for upcoming Switch Port becuz switching weapons on controller through console is just pure wasting time, specially in higher difficulty levels where the room for error is very small. There are tones of enemies, new enemies are introduced as you pregress into the game. First chapter takes place in a Resident Evil 4 type of setting, pretty cool with some horror aspects, Chapter 2 starts as a very typical military shooter and by far is the weakest chapter but midway to end it starts to introduce some otherworldly transitions that are amazing and add a huge variety to the campaign and lastly episode 3 is by far the best and each level is so distinctive and designed very well and the end game boss is so satisfying and cool :D the combat is chapter 2 is a little bit boring compare to 1 and 3 because the military presence is too much and there arent enough melee battles, you mostly spend your time staying as far as possible and killing enemies, where as in chapter 1 and 3 was more varried because you were encouraged to attack enemies close up. Some levels are little bit too tights and some levels are a bit too wide for no reason, its good variety but platforming sections, such as wall climbing, or passing through traps for hidden items are straight up annoying! but overall the game is so responsive in its shooting and it has amazing range of levels with wide variety to almost cover anything you have in mind that ultimately outweighs all the bad things about this game. I highly recommend everyone this game !. Classic old school action. Excellent level design. Engaging elements of interaction with the environment. Some nice horror moments that accent the action in a perfect fashion. Absolutely killer gun play. A soundtrack that can keep pace with what you need, be that a blaring metal track, or unnerving ambiance. DUSK has absolutely everything you want and more. And never once during its span does it forget that games are about having fun.. The good: beautiful music score, fast and fluid movement, precise mouse control, 90's retro look and feel, secrets to discover in each map. The mediocre: stock standard weapon selection - no innovative weaponry, graphics - personally I find this game to look worse in parts than even some of the old classics (no pixelation to boot). The bad: lifeless protagonist, background and story severely lacking, poor weapon animations, progression from one map to another feels ad-hoc - no sense of what ties them geographically together, many maps are boring to play. Bottom line: i had fun in parts but ultimately had to force myself to finish the game - the originals such as Doom, Quake, Blood, Sin, etc. still reign supreme.. Amazing FPS which not only emulates, but builds upon the legacy of classics like DOOM and QUAKE to make it a unique and modern experience. A truly worthy successor to the id classics of the 90s, do not miss it!. Great throwback to the 90's shooters with very well done gameplay upgrades to the current times. The level design is really good which most of the modern shooters still are unable to get. It does so much with so little and that is where Dusk Shines!! Its a must play for anyone who even remotely likes the FPS genre.. What can I say that hasn't been said? It's true, DUSK is a brilliant loveletter to the 90s FPS games we all know and love, like Quake, Doom, Redneck Rampage, and Blood. However, Dusk also brings the best of these games while trading out the annoying aspects for complete and totally accessibility. DUSK feels good to play, moreso than even most AAA games of today. Movement is fluid and perfect, and very easy to control. The feedback from enemies, weapons, environment, and sound is both informative and fits perfectly. It'll take about 4-6 hours to complete the three episode campaign if your FPS skills are up to snuff, but the game has tons of options for replayability: Awards for completing levels in special ways, loadouts on unlocked levels, endless mode, and multiplayer. Modding support and coop coming in the future as well. The story, while not in-your-face or anything much like the games that inspired it, is both engaging and surprising. The music complimenting each level and dynamically changing with every big moment in the levels is top notch, and Andrew brings the bacon home, both with the heavy metal tracks, and the creepy atmospheric ones. For the price, you can't beat DUSK.. Why are you even reading this? Go buy it. ...or keep reading for more infos. Appearantly, some users do not understand what a ""faithful"" throwback shooter implies. The goal is not to improve on the formula but to create a title that could have very well been released during the era it is aiming for. Dusk is looking to bring back the excitement of playing Quake 1 for the first time. With a fresh new IP but close to it's inspiration. In this regard, the game exceeds all expectations. Thus why reviews from critics have been so high. You need to judge a game for what it is. Pinning it against huge releases like Doom 2016 is just unfair as it dosent aim to get any close to a modern shooter. The goal is the complete opposite. This game pretty much is a nostalgia time machine. It quite literally kicked me back to my childhood. Good times. This game SHOULD be in your library if you are a retrogaming fan. Especially if you like early ID FPS titles. Only downsides I can give can be summarized in 2 points... wich are admitedly more nitpicking than actual huge issues. 1) Lacks that ONE gun that makes you want to come back constantly. Most of the arsenal is fairly generic with the notable exception of dual sickles. Do not get me wrong, the weapons feels AWESOME to use. This game just needs it's ""bfg"". Or at the very least a weapon to distinguish itself from the crowd. Outside from those sickles you probably won't use much. 2) Some enemies and the way they are used ingame sometime makes it harder than it should be. And not always for the right reasons. But hopefully these moments are quite rare. But youll know what I mean when it happens.. From what I see now, the game is a solid 9 / 10. Dusk keeps creating interesting shootouts throughout the levels, filled with not-so-challenging but time-consuming secrets, which sometimes appear to be handy. The game freaks you out at first with all the jump scares, but, then again, you get used to them in an hour or so. The soundtrack is very nice (especially those ambient pieces), and the shooting mechanics are very tasty. Acquire this game if you want some old-school experience without strings attached (such as compatibility problems or performance issues).. The first person shooter has evolved massively over the laster 25 years. We've gone from simple key hunting and monster bashing to Hollywood set pieces and storylines. Dusk is a reminder of a more simple time in FPS history. Dusk is a retro, 90's style FPS game which captures pretty much everything that defines a ""retro shooter"". Fast paced action, banging soundtrack and a certainly retro feel with regards to models and textures which only add to it's charm. I grew up with Doom, Quake and Half Life. This game makes me feel 15 again back when I was running Quake on a 266MHz Pentium 2 with a 2MB graphics card. The movement in Dusk is fluid and if you're used to strafe jumping and bunny hopping, you'll find yourself moving around maps at breakneck speed. Shooting feels impactful and every gun feels powerful and fun to use, blowing enemies into little chunks using the super shotgun never stops feeling satisfying. Enemies are varied and episodes change up what kind of monsters you'll be facing. The atmosphere and level design is superb, yes there is key hunting and exploring which may feel like it slows down the action, but this is how it was back in the 90's. Not every single second of gameplay was a sensory overload, it provided a welcome break in the fighting and let you get your breath back. The sound design and music are incredible. Andrew Hulshult's soundtrack provides both engaging atmospheric background noise and head banging metal for when the action kicks in. Enemies have their own distinct sounds and I guarantee that you will never forget your first encounter with the Wendigo in Episode 2! The inclusion of an endless mode adds to the replayability and there are plenty of well hidden secrets which will keep you coming back for more. For me, a 90's FPS veteran, Dusk is a dream game. It doesn't complicate life by throwing a thousand different mechanics at you. It runs at a silky smooth framerate and you'll find yourself flying around levels once you get into the groove of bunny hopping and strafe jumping. A solid 10/10 from me. I understand that it won't be every body's kind of game, it is after all a throwback to the more simple times in FPS history, but what a throwback it is!. What are the critics smoking? Evolution of genre frozen in time? Ok lets see what we have: Game which feels like hd mod of Quake 1/Duke Nukem 3D. So nothing new/special. On one hand it has amazing atmosphere (which is made mostly by awesome sounds and creepy concept of cultists devilish goats scarecrows) on second - its plain ugly. Weapons looks well just awfull. Enemies too. Its fast and fluid like Quake 1 but how is it any better than well Quake 1? It isnt. Genre did evolve, we have story packed games with awesome graphics memorable protagonists (even blood had cool Caleb and Duke Nukem 3D - Duke Nukem :D, hell Wolfenstein had Blazkowitch) like Halo, Half Life, Call of Duty, Destiny, Bioshock, Metroid Prime, Wolfenstein, Doom etc. In terms of pure fps mayhem I can compare this to for example recent Shadow Warrior 1/2 or Doom - and Dusk is definitelly worse game than any of them. So is it a bad game? No. But without much trouble You can find as good mods to Quake 1 as Dusk is.. DUSK takes the best conventions and clichés of 90s shooters and perfects them for a new century. This game serves as a sort of Ying counterpart to the Yang of Superhot. While the latter title captured the simple perfection of an under-par shooter run, DUSK captures the wild frenzy of a less disciplined encounter. Modern players may be bewildered by the aesthetic, but the fluidity of the game-play, open-ended level design and the pure thrill of each encounter make this worth a look for younger gamers in addition to those looking for a nostalgia fix. All told DUSK just feels ""right.""","if you feel like you might like it from the trailer you will most definitely love it, it's pretty straight forward . pros.: - Old-school vibe and aesthetics. - references to quake (first one) and Blood. - Creative levels. Especially in Episode 3 . cons.: - sounds are too primitive sometimes ."
511.Excitebike 64,"A decent dirt-bike racing game I guess, literally Excitebike but 3D, a side effect of this is that collisions are very harsh. It feels like the slightest impact with another driver will send you off your bike and careening into a barrier. Which makes for some pretty annoying racing in my opinion. For the NES game this made sense, the tracks are very wide and you can see where everyone is since it's top-down. Here, the tracks are more narrow, and other racers can sneak up on you trying to make a pass which just causes YOU, not the person overtaking, to fall off the bike. Also don't enable Hi-Res in the options menu or you'll have single-digit FPS for races.. Saw this game was unforgivably underrated on the all-time list, so I created an account just to do my small part to help correct that, Excitebike 64 is one of my favourite games of all-time. It's was super fun to play when it came out, and it's super fun to play now. That's all that really needs to be said.. Dirt bike game that concentrates on the racing rather than tricks. The races themselves are pretty short but make for intense and skill-reliant matches and as such is one of the better racers on the N64.. One of my favorite racing games of all time. I don't think that I have played another motor-cross since.. Probably the best N64 motocross game made and even today the game-play still holds up today due to the authentic physics and challenging tracks, highly recommended if you like motocross and are feeling retro.. Excitebike 64 is one of the best racers for the N64, with good graphics, easy controls, and insane game-play. This is a game that you will not regret adding to your collection.. Excitebike 64 is definitely forgettable title. There wasn't anything wrong with it, but there wasn't anything that drew me in. I noticed this title tries to transfer the original Excitebike into the 3-D realm, which worked for titles like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Super Mario 64, but it just makes Excitebike 64 a mediocre motocross that can be compared to the average $0.99 PlayStation 2 motocross game of today. I am sure back then it was good, but today, it doesn't hold up. Just forget about this title! Overall, good graphics of the time, but for present day standards, it's just better to watch it burn in a bonfire!. The best game for the Nintendo 64 that I've played. It's hard to unlock all the tracks, but who cares? It's still fun to play, with nice graphics, and even better sound effects. A must-play.","excitebike 64 is one of my favourite racing games of all-time . it's was super fun to play when it came out, and it's super fun to play now . it's one of the best motocross games for the n64, with good graphics, easy controls ."
512.Shenmue,"One of my favourite games, way ahead of its time and a great story to go along with it.. A wonderful experience. Recently i decided to start Shenmue again and i don't regret it at all.. This game is an absolute jewel. A true classic gaming masterpiece. Everything is amazing. The controls are a little awkward at times while walking or at narrow places. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the wonderful detailed world, the story, the ambiance, the music. Combat is also creative. This game was way ahead of its time. And still today holds on beautifully. What a joyful and adventurous ride with Ryo and company!!!. The game that solidified me as a gamer in 1999. First weather changing system in a game among so many other firsts.. Everything in this game is worth your time. The story is great and the location works as the perfect vehicle to get you to a different yet beautiful world. Production was superb, voice actors, music, mini games. Top 10 game of all time.. Shenmue at its peak point. Innovative for its day. Spectacular awesome ost. You WILL become so engrossed in this game world. Highly recommended. shenmue 2 is a brilliant masterpiece the pace of this game is way better than the first and its more action packed. shenmue was ahead of its time and the sequel was the best open world game when it comes to world interactions.. Just the best game ever created. And I’m always been a Nintendo fan.......... The game is almost perfect, the plot of the champion, characters the same, then the rockstar could clean the shoes of this game, to this day hardly any game can match its genre.. Great game with amazing story, graphics and music for a fantastic system. A must have have for Dreamcast.. The most amazing game ever... That simple Simplemente el más increible juego hecho por la humanidad.. No other games captivates you as immersively as this game has and that's unique.. What a great expirience! Following the first game wich was spectacular for its time, Shenmue ll continues the story with many many great climax moments. Outstanding graphics for the time, memorable soundtrack and plenty of minigames and things to do make this game a 10 out of 10 for me.. It´s probably the best mix between a graphic adventure & a semi open world game, with one OST that easily makes the top 10 in the industry. A truly magnificent piece of art. But be warned: those who want an hamburger, should look someone else. This is gourmet gaming at its finest.. Amazing game for its time. Very big with great graphics and dialogue cinematics, mini-games, story progression, music, attention to detail, everything. Dreamcast was purchased for this game.. Brilliant from start to finish.I Play many games and this game is my best i ever play is like adream is fantastic.I buy XBOX only for this game and i am happy to make that because SHENMUE 2 is brilliant game that i would never forget.10/10. Simply. The. Best. Game. Ever. Made. .. This is the single greatest gaming experience I have ever had. I was enthralled from start to finish, and the ending left me wanting more. The atmosphere is glorious, gameplay is solid, and story is phenomenal. Best game to ever grace this console easily... It's the software personification of the dreamcast IMO. Just as Dreamcast symbolizes the end of a hardcore gaming era whilst trailblazing the future of the industry(for better or worse), Shenmue is the prime software example of this. A beautifully animated character driven narrative focused open world game, now of which are a dime a dozen, but with arcadish gameplay and a sense of immersion that still has yet to be matched 18 years later. Absolutely everything about Shenmue, just like the dreamcast itself, was painfully detailed and no effort was spared. It also pioneered and/or popularized so many common modern gaming tropes its astounding. So much that we take for granted today was absolutely breathtaking with the release of Shenmue.... This is the best game I have ever played and in hindsight provided experience that no other came close to providing. I would say it changed and shaped my life, something no other game was able to do. The problem is after you finish it, you realize what games could be like, but they arent. Playing it makes you imagine a world of amazing experiences told through games, that didn't materialize.. With an expanded universe, Shenmue 2 brought us improved mechanical, with better graphics and significant additions compared to its predecessor. Some old problems like fps drop, but not compromise the amazing experience that the game gives us. The two games certainly are one of the largest not only contributions of the sixth generation of consoles, but from all the gaming industry! Shenmue and a perfect game!. This original and the best open world game needs no introduction. It has the best details of all games I've seen, amazing variety of Gashapon, all characters including pedestrians are voiced and have unique lines which change according to your progress. I wonder how many players even managed to hear 50% of the total dialogues? Anyway let's get to the flaws. Slow pacing is a very obvious flaw of this game. You spend hours and hours on this game doing missions and mini-games, yet the story is still getting nowhere. The long loading screen after every map transition also doesn't help at all. Quality of the game gets worse towards the end of the game. The trend started at the end of disc 3. The dungeon is so unnecessarily long playing the game becomes a chore. More pronounced is disc 4 where Shenmue 2 gets very strange. It becomes a cinematic game. There is no fight, you just walk and talk for hours, wondering if the conversations are going to end. Then immediately after arriving at your destination you get to the shocking ending. I think that's when the developers realised they were developing for a dead console so they just decided to get it over with. I can't blame them, yet I can't help but feel the ending is a let down after such an epic journey.. Xbox version I would give a 9 but the dreamcast version is better. Cause is more memorable and more nostalgic than almost every dreamcast game. (besides Sonic Adventure 1&2). It's kinda sad that its been nearly 15 years since SEGA started throwing in the towel and discontinues not only the Dreamcast, but buried in the home console market and the dream just nearly died too soon. Even though I haven't even own a Dreamcast, but I was floored by playing a criminally under-appreciated RPG game that's stands the test of time. And that game was Shenmue. No, not Shenmue II (Get it right, Metacritic. Shenmue is only available for the OG XBOX console), just the original Shenmue. It was eventually become the Dreamcasts last gasp at creating a world like I've never seen before. I fell in love with this game as much as everyone does. Not only I enjoyed the peaceful soundtrack, but an lists of jaw-dropping graphics, a Final Fantasy-ish story that is perfect, the gameplay was so special in my view, outlandish characters and a blended amount of hype that made series creator Yu Suzuki very proud and very sad on how developing a long hard cycle for the game that has took a long time to build and it went through development hell just after Shenmue II because fans desperately wants serious questions why an announcement to Shenmue III never happened. I also give a extra praise to AM2 for adding new features that had to be played online by using an somewhat obscure Dreamcast keyboard and mouse so that you can chat with so many players online and QTE (quick time events) is entirely focuses on the player has to choose right or wrong decisions to make sure you are keeping track in progress. It's a gifted open-world adventure that keeps pushing us together and as of today, several open-world games continue to buck the trend after Shenmue (which continues to feature an outpouring of support by fans around the world despite the Dreamcast's short-lived lifespan). Let's face it! GTA III, Fallout's 3 and 4, Bioshock, Skyrim, Uncharted, Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy VII, the originator of the open-world genre, both Ultima and Myst, Super Mario 64, and The Legend of Zelda. And don't forget No Man's Sky for the PS4 is coming up soon and so does E3 2016. I know SEGA is in rough shape right now, but I got to thinking if they were be able to breath new life and announce a big comeback in the console market, I would love to see a Dreamcast 2 in the future. Good news: now that the Kickstater campaign was a huge success, my prediction at E3 will be an announcement to the most anticipated games of the century, Shenmue III, to be announced in 2017 and l wish it could be a unaminous GOTY contender. Please SEGA, make an Shenmue I and II HD Remaster for me? I'm gonna be so tearfully joyed.. Meh, it was alright. It was much better than the first, but still had far too much tedium. The story is really boring and kinda convoluted. It just takes way too long to do anything. For instance, I counted and it takes 14 seconds to use an elevator NOT including the load time. So the game shows you walk into the elevator, hit the button for the floor you want, then it brings you to the load screen, then it shows you step out of the elevator. This happens every time you use an elevator. That **** adds up as Kowloon is basically all elevators. This is just one example of tedium you'll encounter in Shenmue games. The music was really good though.. It was the best interactive experience of all time when it came out, and still is today. What Shenmue had achieved in 2001 is still unmatched as of today.. Those who played shenmue, surely will put this game on their top ten list of ""best games of all time""!!! Don't know if the current generation will love this game, but I am sure that a remastered edition and eventually Shenmue 3 would bring happiness to a legion of fans.. Shenmue 2 is a fantastic game which was well ahead of its time. The most stunning aspect of the game is its sheer detail; for example, you can enter pretty much enter every building and every apartment/room in those buildings. The music is memorable, the graphics are great for the time and the pacing issues of the first game are solved and it is far more action-packed. Highly recommended for anyone who owns a Dreamcast.. Possibly the greatest gaming experience you will ever have. Shenmue 1 was a good build-up and prologue (and an amazing game), but Shenmue 2 simply blows it out of the water. The environments, gameplay, storytelling, and character development are second to none. Once I started my first playthrough I could hardly put down the controller. The game hardly has a dull moment, and if you can survive the relentless quick time events, it's an absolute blast. I just wish Sega would wise up and find a way to bring us the next two or three games.. In this players humble opinion, the greatest video game ever created. Yu Suzuki's brainchild, Shenmue 1 and 2 was a work of art , and came very close to simulating a young Japanese man's life and struggles in the late 80's. The innovation was **** was an archetype for many features we see in gaming today, including QTE's, weather effects (weather was randomized and actual recorded weather forecasts were used), interactivity etc. It propelled the medium to new heights and left a lasting impression on those that had the privilege to play it. Although it was a financial failure, and left the world with a whimper, it was an attempt to defy the tested the tried principles of gaming mechanics and transcend the boundaries of video gaming as a whole. The atmosphere was just off the charts. You could start chatting with just about anyone, and you truly felt like you were part of a living, breathing world. You could visit an arcade , collect toys , feed kittens or just hang out at the soda machine and gulp down fizzy drinks all day. Later , you could participate in arm wrestling matches with Spanish men that oozed machismo, or take a load off and play a round of darts with a snobbish mustachio dude. The world was yours to discover and manipulate as you saw fit. The variety in gameplay methods never allowed the game itself to drag on, the sheer quantity of things to do and places to go could keep you busy for hours. There were easter eggs like obtaining a sega saturn game or participating in duck racing. Ahh, the memories. The graphics were unparalleled at the time. The Dreamcast's 200mhz (or so) processor was tested to it's limits, everything was thrown at it except the proverbial kitchen sink, but it did not falter and other than a few areas (pigeon park) where the frame rate would slow to a crawl, the game ran smoothly. The orchestral score and in game music were also memorable , from the opening prologue and Lan Di's enigmatic entrance scene to the tomato convenience store theme (best jingle evah!). Yu Suzuki and his team poured their souls into this game, it's just a damn shame that there will probably never be a deserved conclusion to this masterpiece.. Made by Yu Suzuki, creator of the renowned Virtue Fighter franchise. This game offers similar in depth fighting, but adds open world exploration with loads of interactive stuff to collect and mess around with. Its depressing SEGA has not released HD remasters for modern platforms. Truly this series has grown legendary and if it released would cause a huge mass hysteria amongst the growing fan base.. im not saying its bad, but when i play a game im looking for gamplay, which is something this game doesn't do well, its literally a whole game based on quick time events, one of the major sins of video games, not to Mention its high production value is one of the many reasons the dreamcast died. the only thing that's good here is the story. This is a game that took me beyond, it has no rival to date. I played this on the Dreamcast when it first came out, I was a lad back then, and wow, the sheer scope, the advancement in gameplay and graphics, it hit me deep and hard, and brings me joy and great memories to this day. An amazing game that is unforgettable. 10/10. Overall, Shenmue is without doubt in my opinion the finest game ever made. Quite how Shenmue 1 and 2 stack up to one another is unclear to me, as they are both breathtaking and outstanding in their own ways. It's simply magical. It's hard to truly do this game justice with words, but it is an immersive, exciting, poetic and captivating experience that you will most likely remember and take with you forever. Do yourself a favour and play Shenmue, you won't regret it!. Shenmue is an amazing game with great potential and there has to be a Shenmue 3!! its been so long since i last played this game it was awesome great story but its spiritual successor Yakuza is probably better than because it had a better character and a emotional story. Crazy depth to this game, great story, stunning graphics for it's time and amazing attention to detail. In my opinion, one of the more overlooked classics of all-time.. Shenmue 1 is at the top of my favourite games of all time. Once I picked the controller up, I couldn't put it down until the game ended. There is so much to do, I used to spend hours upon hours in the YOU Arcade, collecting toys, buying sodas trying to get a winning can.. Ah, memories. The story is extremely engaging & immersive, the world is absolutely stunning and it's the first game to use dynamic-weather in a 3D world. This game was ahead of it's time, and laid the foundation for many current-gen games. If you love video games, japanese culture, or just love an adventure, don't look any further than Shenmue.. I'm keeping this one short,I can sum this game up in 3 words,BEST GAME....EVER!!!From the moment I started playing this gem at 1st the visuals blew me away,then it went on to have the most ingrossing storys in gaming,& the fact that you could just pop into your local arcade & actually play arcade perfect versions of Outrun,Space Harrier & Afterburner 2 was just showing off!Every gamer worth thier salt needs to experience Shenmue,simple as that.. This game brings me back. The dreamcast was such a great little console and this game is true the consoles defining gem. The game world is highly interactive and oozes atmosphere. The storyline and music and top quality. The acting and dialog is a bit campy, but done in true Sega spirit. This game needs to get remastered on HD consoles. Along with Shenmue II.. easily the best game ever produced. even though it had its flaws, it was simply revolutionary in many aspects. most importantly of course the back then STUNNING graphics. i remember when i was watching one of those 320x240 clips of the intro before it was released and somebody was standing a couple of feet away and asked ""what movie is that?"". i watched that clip again and again for probably half an hour, drooling. and then the open world concept, the overall cinematic feeling, all the little things one could do, the epic feeling of the story, the incredibly well-done fighting system (i was skeptical whether it would work well at first but it really did...), the music which was just as beautiful as the graphics... it was just amazing and i'm afraid i will never experience anything like it ever again in my lifetime. graphics these days **** in comparison (obviously always in respect to current times) and the scope of games is fairly minuscule. from a pure conceptual point of view, i guess one could compare GTA to it. but there, the graphics and story are lacking.. shenmue is a very inovative and fresh new typ of game . you cant compare it to any thing els out there even though this game is 10 years old there still isnt any thing since then thats remotely like this game. you play as Ryu in 1980s japan who's father is murdered by a myserous man named lan di. your goal is to find out about this man . the game play is hard to sum up . its abit being a detective questioning people for info , fighting people in a Virtau fighter style combat , some dragons lair QTE , open world exploration with lots of side stuff to do like playing in a arcade ,collecting toys and more . the fighting controls are pretty solid . the controls when walking around are stiff and the camera fights you alot in small area's . the voice acting can be pretty bad. in some cases laughably bad but this game came out in a day when good voice acting in games still wasnt seen to often . you also can get a job as a fork lift driver which for some reason i just had alot of fun driving it around delivering crates to the ware houses tryin to make that $. i also had alot of fun in the arcade playing darts and hang on. this game to me is a step in the right direction for new and innovating games and i wish we could see more games like this it may not be polished to perfection but it does enough right to get a 9 in my book.. Quite simply the greatest game ever made. Amazing story, amazing characters, great gameplay and graphics. Something truly special. Worth buying a Dreamcast just for this one game.. I was reminded of this game while playing Heavy Rain recently and I can see how at the time this game was such a breakthrough in gaming. At it's heart an RPG but different to anything made to that point. A great experience overall.",the game that solidified me as a gamer in 1999. first weather changing system in a game among so many other firsts.. Everything in this game is worth your time. the pace of this game is way better than the first and its more action packed .
513.Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005,"This is the greatest sports game of all time and it's not even close. The gameplay is pretty seamless and responsive, there's nary a form of weird physics detection or anything like that. The level of customization and game modes on display is insane. Despite being about one sport, and one that many feel is boring to watch at that, it reinvents the way you can approach golf again and again. This game puts modern sports game to absolute shame.. The analogue control scheme introduced by EA's Tiger Woods series remains its single biggest innovation and it certainly continued to keep it ahead of the competition here. Aside from that very little has really changed with the series in a good while but, with its wealth of options and polished gameplay, it has been the only real choice for golf fans for a good while (even if it is only a semi-realistic sim nowadays).. I love this game and i wanna tell you this tiger wood realy approve that he's tiger wood, i give this game 10 because it's deserve. Everything is amaizing, what can the man says, There is no body can be or say anything against it.",this is the greatest sports game of all time and it's not even close . the level of customization and game modes on display is insane . the analogue control scheme introduced by the series remains its single biggest innovation .
514.Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight,"The game is unplayable,stuck so many times in loading screen, I can not even egt my money back becasue of loading screen after loading screen more than 2 hours. DO NOT BUY. If you are in this for the realism and simulator parts, then you are in the right place. Unfortunately, that's not quite what I am looking for. I know that's a little unfair when trying to play a game literally called ""Flight Simulator"", but I feel they really do limit the amount of fun you can have with this game. If there was a more arcade like mode with some quests or objectives, that would be much more fun, but taking 2 hour flights across the country is just not fun. But if its your thing, then it really is the best at what it sets out to do, just not my thing.. To this day in 2012, I still use MSFS2004. In my opinion, the best and most stable release Microsoft has ever produced for flight simulation. Its diversity as far as accepting addon aircraft and scenery, including high resolution mesh is incredible. Flight dynamics and simulation quality are 100% depending on the hardware configuration you have set up. While this software can in theory be played as a game, it truly is a flight simulator in the sense that you do need to know a small amount of flying skills to be able to startup, take of, fly around and land. This software is used to assist in training professional pilots, so that should say enough about its technical potential. A kid looking to have fun flying an arcade-style video game will be seriously disapointed with this software, but experienced flight enthusiasts will love it!. By far the best flight simulation software I have experienced. In the time this was programmed, I had very little knowledge that this would be the ""game"" (using the term very loosely) that made me want to become a pilot. However, despite it's gleaming report from me, there are some downsides. Due to its age, many super-realistic add-ons for the MSFS series only work on FSX which is a shame. But, even then, the add-ons that have been produced are of superb quality, significantly adding to the overall flight simulation experience. In spite of that, the lack of proper surround sound (without modifications) does slightly ruin it but the simulator gets a respectable and deserving 10.","a kid looking to have fun flying an arcade-style video game will be seriously disapointed with this software . due to its age, many super-realistic add-ons for the series only work on FSX which is a shame . the lack of proper surround sound (without modifications) is disappointing ."
515.Medieval: Total War,"Not a great graphics. Main game is only map of Europe like a board game. And you turn pieces on in. But when you go in battle you can play realtime battles with hundreds or thousands soldiers. It was real fun taking the state after state and developing new units. I even bought it with viking expansion on CD and then lately on steam. It had a some bugs mostly in prolonged games (when it fell on some AI actions) or with graphic card on newer computers (more ten 1GB RAM). On steam i had only one bug so far. When you start it, you need to start it twice. First time the loader falls, but second time it works ok.. Second game of the Total War series. Armies move from province to province instead of moving freely over the map. Graphics did not age well.. It's not a perfect game, far from it. Still I enjoy it more than any other Total war game I have played. A very enjoyable game really.. This game is great. You can conquered the whole world and fight against many different armies. You can fight in real time deciding everything or you can make a quick battle. If you are a good strategist it's better to combat directly yourself. You'll save more soldiers for your future battles. I only recommend the quick battle when you have conquered many territories and you have many resources (then you don't mind to lose some soldiers). I still remember that I wasn't able to reach America cause I had to upgrade my ships and I didn't know that! lol. Best game of the series of total war the main game map is the best bit the war maps are all much the same if your a rome total war fan you will love this i would say most people would like this more than rome. A good RTS game, I am a big crusades history buff, not to mention a big fan of medieval battles, and so this game, particularly the Crusades expansion, was a dream come true. As per usual, the unit detail and overall graphics are amazing and the best part of this game is definitely the real-time battle element. The AI is kind of shoddy and the campaign map gameplay is not the best, but I do love this game. Just not perfect because there's a lot of room for improvement still.. Its not just great but also dark its full of turmoil and violence its simply the best medieval game which brings the horror of the medieval age into the player to feel the terror and religious conflicts of the dark ages Best game in the series so far.. Best game of the series holding its throne together with Rome total war..this ""risk"" style of moving across the map also has its own charm i still play it active after 10 years. My first Total War game. After that, I never looked back! Excellent game in all respects, have not ever had a single issue with it. Loved playing it as a kid, love playing it still today. Great stuff!!","i bought this game with viking expansion on CD and then lately on steam . it had a few bugs mostly in prolonged games (when it fell on some AI actions) on steam i had only one bug so far: when you start it, you need to start it twice ."
516.R4: Ridge Racer Type 4,"Ridge Racer Type 4 is one of, if not THE best racing games on PS1. After 2 games where they reeeally butchered the handling (RR: Revolution and Rage Racer) they FINALLY got it right and wow does it feel nice! I love the direction they went with the series too, you choose one of 4 racing teams to choose your difficulty, one from France (Beginner), one from Japan (Intermediate), one from Italy (Hard), and one from America (Expert). Then you choose one of 4 car manufacturers, 2 of them have grip handling, Terrazi (Japanese) and Age Solo (French) and 2 have drift handling, Assoluto (Italian), and Lizard (American). Each team has their own unique story, and people in the story will also act differently towards you depending on your performance during the GP. it's really well done, and I wish more companies would put this kind of effort into their games nowadays. The graphics are unparalleled for the PS1, nothing else comes close on this system, not even Gran Turismo 2, which was made IN HOUSE by Sony at Polyphony Digital. And the soundtrack and art direction in this game man, it a whole vibe, you just have to play it to understand. Get This Game.. The GOAT of the series, everything is amazing about this game, the style, the soundtrack, the gameplay, the menu and everything else it has to offer, an absolute piece of art that Namco created. This game is beauty, it runs like smoothly, the story mode is fun and surprisingly touching. But above everything, it is a fun game. Ridge Racer is unique and I would love to see a remake with cars and tracks from R4, the Og Ridge Racer and Rage Racer.. it's very cool game that is quite fun. uuuuuuuh **** uhhhhhhhhhhhhh namco :). Gran Turismo may have more content, more tracks, more of everything, but this game just has the soul and passion that makes us play games. It is sad to see we don't get games like this anymore. I love this game.. i want to give this game an 8/10 score, but man m,y heart says otherwise, great and amazing game, the only downside of this game is beacause gran turismo 2 is better, fact. Really miss this series. Soundtrack and content are superior to the rest of the series except for RR7. Good game, standard arcade racer. 7/10 .. An awesome racer up there with gran Turismo but just lacks official content, gameplay 10/10. One of the best/favorite of Ridge Racer Series, with their own Story via Gran Prix Mode with difference team (depending on team difficulty), very smooth gameplay, easy to control (play it via PS3 physical/digitally), with some some cuts from Japanese Original but only minor nothing major, lot of modes, lots of different type of cars, special features only via replay/demo mode, all the tracks is awesome and the original, remaster and 20th anniversary soundtracks is amazing Does R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 deserve a remaster?. The Best Ridge Racer Series ever even with Original or 20th Anniversary Soundtrack (does it deserved a remastered?). You may call it nostalgia, but it was the first game I ever played in my whole life when I was just 3 years. It's very special for me. My favorite game ever, and I have been playing videogames for more than 15 years.. Best arcade racing game ever, everything in this game is 10. Masterpiece, thanks Namco.. Best racing game of all time and it's not only because of the racing itself. It has great graphics, good story, that special ""chic"" atmosphere and memorable acid jazz soundtrack. If you enjoyed this game, you HAVE to buy the soundtrack along with it for the best experience.. Very cool arcade racing game with a huge game length. However, the number of cars is actually pretty low because most of them are just the same with different team colors. Still, on of the funniest racing games ever with all the drifting mechanics and the cool tracks.","after 2 games where they reeeally butchered the handling (RR: Revolution and Rage Racer), they FINALLY got it right . the graphics are unparalleled for the PS1, nothing else comes close on this system, not even Gran Turismo 2, which was made IN HOUSE by Sony at Polyphony Digital ."
517.Shadow Complex,"This game at least enters the conversation of greatest of the Metroidvania genre! Gameplay is crisp and precise and makes exploration as smooth as it could be. The upgrades that exlporation/leveling affords are fun and offer interesting ways to access previously inaccessible areas. The graphics are simply stunning, adopting a 2.5D environment that makes this side-scroller feel as though it is a bit more. Boss battles are fun and engaging, and each require a new set of tactics to master. As you build your character's arsenal (especially his armored suit), your character exhibits a level of progression that even Super Metroid did not quite reach. This game is a must-play even if you are not a fan of the genre, but if you are a fan of the genre and you have yet to play this game then your life is about to change...permanently.. If you grew up like me, loving classic's like; Super Metroid, Castlevania and Bionic Commando then you will love this game!. I purchased during XBLA weekend sale for 4.50! Best 4.50 spent in my life! Highly, highly recommended, no matter the price!. Shadow Complex captures the essence of Metroidvania games and has some very great upgrades to boot. Excellent sense of progression, interesting plot great exploration and a good combat system. This game is probably the best XBLA game you can get.. Awesome Metroidvania type of game. One of the most fun games I've played. Game design is excellent. I loved the mix of 2d with 3d. Sometimes the controls can be frustrating **** character doesn't do what you want him to do.. A 3D game played on a 2D plane Shadow Complex takes a few minutes to get the hang of but its addictive gameplay will quickly **** in most gamers that give it a go. Truth be told much of what the game does has been seen before in other, more famous, titles. The games structure for example is taken straight from the Metroid series with more and more areas been opened up as you acquire new weapons. Despite this I had an enormous amount of fun during the six or so hours to it took me complete it. The game is fast paced and, after a little practice, the controls quickly become second nature. On the normal difficulty setting it provides a decent challenge without ever become frustratingly hard and, unlike a few other titles I could name, it’s relatively short running time means it never outstays its welcome. It won’t be a contender for greatest game ever but at 1200 (about £10) this is an absolute steal.. This is my most favorite game of all time. This game blew my brains out... it took me back to old school roots and had a new school flavor to it. I can't stress enough how badly this game needs a sequel and for it to be on Steam. The fun factor of this game is A+. The controls are fantastic it just feels right. I love this game so much that after beating it, I beat it again... and then after that I simply took a previous save point before the final boss so I could explore every detail of the game. The fire of this game was put out by it's own company, Chair, because of their desire to enter the iPhone market with a $hitty game called Infinity Blade... then made part 2. I wish there was a petition to get this game going again, Shadow Complex makes all games look like. While it doesn't have tons of replay value, Shadow Complex is an entertaining diversion if you're looking for something to play. It doesn't particularly innovate in any way, but it's a fun Metroid-style game with modern gadgets and guns.. The game is a 2.5 D side scroller, which means that your character moves only in 2 dimensions but the world is rendered in 3D. One weird aspect of this is that you can shoot in 3D, but the controls do not allow for aiming in 3D leading to thumb crunching guess work in such situations. At one point, instead of lobbing my precious grenades and rockets at the massive 60 foot monster machine, i ended up blowing away foot soldiers because of the auto-aim in 3D. But mostly, it works well, and adds depth in the massacre when working with the unlimited ammo gun. Yep the gun is unlimited ammo. I'm kind of ambivalent about this one one hand, it enables a very satisfying romp through the scenes with the trigger pressed down, but on the other it takes away from the challenge. Speaking of which, I set the difficulty to my usual (Max 1), which proved to be far too easy once the upgrades started kicking in. So if that's your usual setting, crank it up to max difficulty. You'll soon get used to it. The game has 2 options for play ""Campaign"" and ""Proving Grounds"". DO NOT start the tutorial. Read that again DO NOT start the tutorial. Jump straight into the campaign mode. The campaign mode has an excellent staged, contextual learning system built in. Going through the tutorials reveals all the upgrades and takes away from the satisfaction of mastering the abilities on the fly. You can come back to the ""Proving Grounds"" to complete the challenges and try to beat your own score. The campaign mode follows the story of Jason Fleming, and his girlfriend who go hiking and discover the well.. ""Shadow Complex"". The plot line is acceptable if a little cliched, but the acting and cut scenes are hilariously overacted and scripted. They would have been ""camp"" funny if the characters didn't take themselves so seriously. There's an inexplicable Jason's Dad angle which i don't quite get. Maybe it's a setup for the sequel. Simply put find bad guy, which is everyone except yourself, and kill them. Some classics don't need to be improved upon. I've come around to the firm belief that everything is more fun with a projectable grappling hook. It worked for Just Cause, and it worked wickedly well for Earthworm Jim. Shadow Complex is no exception. It's particularly satisfying to pull away the shield from an enemy using the hook. The game manages to balance the main story line and the scavenging aspect fairly well. I cannot be usually bothered to scrounge around for every little bob-end for an infinitesimal upgrade to my already formidable powers. Shadow complex excels at this by a) Making the discovery of upgrades particularly satisfying as they are hidden away well, and its not a matter of a marathon trek across deserted scapes. You actually have to think a little bit. It all becomes easier with the hook. and b) Making the upgrades worthwhile. It's not another doohickey to make my gun shine with a ruby attachment. Most of the upgrades simply but usefully increase the amount of ammo i can carry, hence increase the number of people i can kill without re-loading. That's EXACTLY what i want from an upgrade. Something that completely baffles me, though, is why in the world did they not stick to the usual control mechanism for shooters left joystick for aim, right trigger for shooting. It's know to work. Why muck around. Now we end up with my already overloaded right hand to do aim shoot with RT and shoot deadlier stuff with the RB. All while I'm standing still and my left hand hanging limp on that side, while the right hand is in advanced stages of carpal tunnel syndrome. My absolute favourite part is the gameplay. It's incredible how many big name titles get this wrong. It's even in the name G A M E P L A Y. All the visual imagery and pimple detail in high res is useless if the game isn't playable. Shadow complex is a great example of gameplay done right. The movement is quick, without any loading screens. Most situations have multiple solutions each of them equally satisfying. At one point I even managed to beat the game bypassing a crucial step simply through ingenuity. This isn't about my massively reticulated brain, but the fact that the game allows you to do stuff that even the designers had not anticipated. Its speaks volumes of the game engine more than anything else. To wrap it up great game play, stock plot line, hacky dialogue, fantastic upgrade system and some innovative weapons (The creative possibilities of the foam gun are practically limitless), and no loading screens! I finished the main story line in a couple of evenings amounting to about 14 hours of serious gameplay. This included about 60% of item discovery. About five minutes into the game I had forgotten that this is a 800 Meg download.. Taking the classic Metroidvania formula into 2.5d, Shadow Complex's high points shine through, but so do it's faults. The game allows to player to move in only 2 dimensions, but provides 3 dimensional interaction. Enemies will assault players from both the foreground and the background, and players can let the game aim for them, or use the right stick to aim themselves. The shooting controls are not without fault, and can seem clumsy and imprecise to new players. Where the game shines however, is it's level design and progression. The game makes very good use of space, allowing several paths to be taken through most encounters. There are also more than a few pickups that require exceptional skill and forethought to obtain. The progression through the game is absolutely sublime, players go from a poor schmuck way in over his head to a veritable super soldier, the early gameplay does well to compliment this as well, with plenty of light stealth until a better weapon is found. Players are armed with a flashlight from the beginning, which, like the X-ray visor of it's predecessor inspirations, allow you to see the weaknesses of objects. Unfortunately the music is a forgettable score of chord swells and harmonies, and the story resembles putting Nathan Drake of Uncharted fame into a project heavily inspired by Kojima's Metal Gear series. Bland characters fall to the far background and a forgettable antagonist that tries to be sinister lives in the shadow of his impressive and massive complex.. An amazing 2.5D shooter that combines Golden Eye with Super Metroid for a fun, yet disappointingly short, experience. The voice cast was good and the enemies were a good challenge, but next time give the game some depth. Seriously, if I hadn't got stuck on a few parts I could have finished this in 4 hours tops. Let's hope a good sequel will solve all the petty little problems that kept this gem from being a diamond.. Great game. My only complaint is aiming at the enemies in the background is very difficult. But once you get the rocket launcher that becomes a lot easier. Also, the story, while good, isn't ver in depth. Other than that, it is one of the more enjoyable games I've played with some of the best gameplay.. 9/10 = Amazing = Tons of replay value, and overall a very fun game. I still prefer the metroid's and castlevania's of the world though. Horrifyingly bad story.. For the first half-hour of this game I got that sinking feeling - that feeling unique to DLC and downloaded games that comes because you know that you can't re-sell it or get a refund. Perhaps because of that very reason I decided to plough on, if only to get my money's worth. I've never been more grateful for my miser tendencies. Shadow Complex is a very good game. It's a perfect blend of platforming and puzzle-solving; just challenging enough to test you, and interesting enough to make you come back for me. Each chapter rewards you with an upgrade that entices you to carry on with anticipation of what powers and abilities the next upgrade might offer. Every challenge in the game, from the puzzles to the boss fights, tests your use of these upgrades and are designed to acquaint you with your new powers. People have said it rips-off Metroid. I see it in the same way I view Dead Space - a game that takes the best components of its genre and merges them together into a whole that is greater than the sum of all its parts. I hesitate to give it a 9/10 because it is a little on the short-side, although, perhaps if it was any longer it might have become tedious, so maybe that's unfair of me. A longer, slightly more difficult final boss would certainly have raised it from an 8/10, as it felt a tad anti-climatic. Nevertheless, it's easily my favourite game on XBL.. An amazing game. No doubt about it this is the best arcade game ever and I got it when it was half-price! I had it for only a month though and I got 100% completion so now the campaigns pointless as I have unlimited everything and i'm pretty much unkillable. BUT, there is also awesome challenges to keep you occupied and these and the campaign all look gorgeous. So get this game no matter what the cost, i'm just lucky I got it half price. :D","this game captures the essence of the Metroidvania genre and has some very great upgrades . the graphics are simply stunning, adopting a 2.5D environment that makes this game feel as though it is a bit more . if you are a fan of the genre and you have yet to play this game then your life is about to change...permanently ."
518.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3,"People arw dumbasses to think this is MWIII 2023 lmao. MW3 2011 was goated game, and you give bad reviews to other game. Start thinking idiots.. An almost carbon copy of Modern Warfare 2. It does little to improve the franchise.. One of the most goated title whole Call Of Duty Series, with a 10/10 story line and FPS walkthrough. Back when Call of Duty was great. We wanted Modern Warfare 4. Not a dumb retconned reboot. We adult Call of Duty fans never asked for a dumb reboot let alone it being influenced by the stupid game Fortnite. This is the real Modern Warfare 3. I loved it. I loved it so much. I loved the ending, I loved the plot, and I also think it's pretty good. Not better than the first two but still a solid COD game.. Although it ultimately gives the beloved cast of characters a good send-off, this outing fails to separate itself from its predecessors and the fast-rising Black Ops series.. I will keep this brief and to the point. I spent Hours and I mean hours on this game and time and time again I find myself quiting to play anything else. The game is just bad. Gun fights are a joke ranked play is a disaster pay to win pack drops I mean you cant have a more money hungry company then what call of duty and their developers have come out with these past few **** all the comments and reviews of people saying to just “get good” are clueless and obviously didn’t grow up on the cods that actually were enjoyable. Above anything else the servers are just horrible. Can’t play one game without stutters and lag packet loss, yet I play any other game out right now and don’t have a single issue. This company no longer listens to their customers it’s about how quickly and how deep they can reach into your pockets every single year. They better outdo themselves this year with a game that “supposedly” was in the making for 3 years because the entire cod community is just beyond tired of these games coming out every year being the same game just reskinned with worse weapons. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Expected more from this game, especially since 1 & 2 were awesome. This is just a casual game, nothing special about it. Graphics is good, nothing much about story. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The skins are awful and a terrible idea childish, naf, perfectic and embarrassing. Need to go back to the games roots of the original gritty game addictive simplistic game play without people sliding round on the floor like a ten year old in the school hall. It has becomea joke ****....... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Love the game but this old rotating cycle of removing game modes. Just have them all available?! Rust is there but only in Gunfight mode which completely ****. Plunder is all gone and me and my friends were supposed to play Plunder tomorrow?? You guys have done this for ages. How can you not care about the people who pay for this? Your level of service ****.. i want this on pc to play with my mates, but its 40 f***ing dollars. f*** you actobismal.. Worst CoD ever. Very bad: SBMM, Spawn system, classEditor/loadout system, bugged loadout with IFF, battlepass system, Whole game layout overloaded.. Good: Nothing. Honestly i think that all of the og COD's are amazing games. But out of all 3 of the games i would place this 2nd. COD MW 2, COD MW 3 and COD 4.. Survival comes in MW3, really good the plotof the storyline follows well with all its predecessors. The multiplayer is perfect. THIS IS the real MW3.. This is the worst Call of Duty of all time. Even worse than Vangaurd. The campaign is the worst its ever been, rushed, and incomplete. Also with a horrible storyline. The multiplayer is broken. Visibility is poor, SBMM makes the game boring, all recycled content. And zombies ****. Seriously, its like they didnt even try. They basically gave a big middle finger to classic call of duty players, and proved how greedy and money hungry they are.. THIS ISN'T THE 2023 CALL OF DUTY 3 THIS IS AN OLD AND BETTER ONE. THIS IS NOT THE 2023 CALL OF DUTY III. Great game. Phenomenal story. Great map design. Super fun. Wish the new Call of duty’s can play like this.. Has a worse cheating problem than mw2 definitely not recommended,first game came across a German hacker I have video proof the graphics are decent but multiplayer is completely ruined. My favorite call of duty of all time brilliant campaign and epic conclusion to og mw trilogy one of the best multiplayer experiences ever, and the best spec ops and third mode ive ever enjoyed in call of duty survival is just that fun.. One of the best games ever! MW 3 2023 deservesbad reviews not this! ,,,,,,,. This Game for me is **** campaign is fire,the missions are very good,too,but the gameplay is the same as the other titles in the OG MW Series,but the rest of the game is good.. I personally loved this game, it was really good but I just love the og COD games anyways. Timeless classic and an amazing send off to the original trilogy the multiplayer is fantastic and plays very well. Man, I come to post my review on this game, man.... They bombarded with bad reviews the game that closes an acclaimed trilogy, if only they had taken the time to read ""MW3"" (which is a very big difference from ""MWIII"") they would know there are big differences. This is the game I've been playing since I was a kid, this game has touched my heart, that's why I come to help fix the score. 100/10.. Weapon balance in the Multiplayer was generally good; the Multiplayer itself was fun, the campaign was a bit underwhelming but a good sendoff to the trilogy, and overall a damn good game.. Ah ok, nada demais, faltou Cool nesse Cool of Duty. my favorite modern warfare. this is basically a fixed mw2 but in my opinion way better. the story is a step down but the multiplayer is super fun with the customization, maps, and the player icons. and spec ops is the best part with a survival mode. survival is kind of like zombies but with less things to do. and spec ops missions can be multiplayer and a lot of missions.. Good ending for a fantastic trilogy. Loved the story but the game is way too short. Overall rating: 7.4.. Certainly a disappointment after the first two, the story feels rushed and the multiplayer is basically the same as the last one but the added survival mode is great. Still a great game and a fin conclusion if you ask me.. This game shows how the original Call of Duty Modern Warfare trilogy is the model of consistency bringing a cool action-packed story with kick ass characters and fun environments and weapons. The only thing I wish they would change is making the story last longer than 6 hours cause all the modern warfare games feel a little too short. This game was a little disappointing due to the setup from the previous game, but it still manages to deliver a great experience and a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. Trying to understand all of the bad reviews for this game >.>. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Honestly there is nothing new to this game. It plays exactly the same as all the previous Call of Duty games since Modern Warfare 1. The graphics are the same, the sound is the same, and worst of all the game play is exactly the same.. It's a OKAY game but it's surely not even close to mw1 or 2. Story is just too quick in terms of action... Everything is happening very fast and you can't relax for a while in some calm mission. For me it was just too many explosions and too many unnecessary enemies respowns. Countless waves of enemies is just a bad decision... I've died too many times from blowing cars and enemies spowning in front of me or behind me. Story is okay but it's not that engaging and well thought as previous mw games.. The end of the original Modern Warfare Trilogy. Unfortunately it's not innovative in terms of gameplay but it's still very fun. My favorite story in series, more action and some very iconic missions. The Multiplayer is unfortunately a little bit uninteresting and the maps are decent. Last but not least, the Spec Ops missions are even better than before, there's a good amount of content. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10.. It was my first Call of Duty game, my mother bought it for me in 2018 (or 2016, or 2017 oh my good i can't recall!). And when i played it i was very happy and ready to fill Makarov with his terrorist face! And for haters i have only one sentence: shut up and don't touch my nostalgia! Even if we lived in a utopia, you still wouldn't **** like something! I absolutely do not give a **** about bugs, shortcomings of something, or the simplicity of the plot! It was my first ,,Call of Duty"" game and i love it.. Idc what people say this is one of my favorite cod games ever made and a great final, looking back in 2021 this maybe be not to good **** but it’s surely better than the others, I recommend a try and you will love it campaign amazing and heartbreaking, multiplayer enjoyable (now) spec ops enjoyable,. In 2011, it was popular to scold MW3. After the scandal with Infinity Ward and the magnificent Black Ops 2 in MW3, there was nothing new. This is a continuation of the MW2, without any improvement. But now 10 years later it is clear that then the series was still in order. The plot of the single game finally became delusional, but fun and he keeps the player at the screen for his 4-5 hours. There are interesting missions that do not look like a tire with endless balvanches. Even Russians have been shown not complete idiots, which is very rare. Yes, it was with this part that the fall of the Call of Duty series began, but it is clearly not the worst of them.. The End of the Original Modern Warfare Trilogy, personally my favorite story in the series, with even more action, and some fantastic & emotional missions, but a less enjoyable Multiplayer experience.. The biggest thing about MW3's development was that most of the original Infinity Ward Team left to form Respawn Entertainment, that original Infinity Ward development team would go on to make the Titanfall Games. Since that team left, the developing cycle became shorter for the making of MW3 going around 6-8 months which was the shortest COD Game development cycle. But, Infinity Ward still was able to conclude the Modern Warfare Trilogy in a pretty good way. The Campaign was amazing since it actually wrapped up the real story unlike with Black Ops 3 which didn't take place after BO2 and it didn't follow-up on your decisions from the BO2 Campaign. Spec Ops was brought back from MW2 making new missions, an endless survival mode, & a brand new mode called Chaos Mode which is a Quick PVE Mode where you chain kills to score as many points as possible before time runs out. MW3's Spec Ops was a big step-up after MW2 but its still not better than Treyarch Zombies. MW3's Multiplayer didn't stand out that much compared to the rest of the Modern Warfare Trilogy but we still got new features like Specialist Kill-streaks (which can transform the players into super soldiers by giving them all of the perks) & community game-modes like All or Nothing & Infected. One significant change about MW3's Multiplayer was the Season Pass because it was sold like a big Battle-Pass for 12 months and it didn't have 4 DLC Drops like Black Ops 1. The system was dropping new Maps & Game modes like the Face-off Playlist (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, & Hardcore 3v3), the overall Season Pass really shook up the game a lot. MW3 Multiplayer also has the most overall launch content having over 50+ Guns to use & 16 Maps to play on, it has the best launch multiplayer IMO. Overall, if the development cycle was longer than it would've been originally, it would've been the best game of the Trilogy.. Rating based of single player campaign. I do not play multiplayer. With that said, decent game with a decent ending.. Call Duty Modern Warfare 3 basic step to get the franchise in on the good game play that was in Call of Duty Modern Warfare , The campaigns in the last 3 games have been kind of disappointing and it's just say that Black Ops was a fever dream. It was an enjoyable popcorn experience so it's ok. Gameplay : 8/10 Design (video + audio) : 7/10 Story : 7/10 Technical aspects : 8/10 Repeatability: 8/10. This game has it all: a heart-wrenching campaign, addicting and rage inducing multiplayer, and the occasionally fun spec ops mode.. Personally, this is my second favourite call of duty game, behind black ops 2. While not objectively one of the better call of duty games, I have some incredible memories from this game that I will never get. That is why I love this game dearly.. i love this game the zombie which is like gta survival series is the best part the online stinks and the story mode is great awesome game.. As many of others have pointed out this game is just a glorified map pack of the previous title. The campaign was ok and the ending was cool ig but it really didn't stand out enough to be considered good. Just ok. Also they did it again with a boring 1 dimensional character but this time its frost. Just like with the other 2 games the American had a fun mission with a good looking area and map but with no personality to the point where it's physically agitating. I do not like this game and i regret replaying it. 1 star.. Easily the best CoD game in the franchise. Brilliant ending to the story, phenomenal multiplayer and excellent spec ops mode. You can play this for hours. (if you can find a multiplayer match today, although that isn't really the game's fault.). I don’t understand why this game was so hated. It might look almost the same as MW2, all the mechanics might be the same, but taking the newer games into consideration, MW3 deserves a lot of praise. Campaign- Great story, mission locations and atmospheres are very diverse compared to the last 2 modern warfare games. Characters very memorable as always in the MW trilogy. A fitting end. Special Ops- A drastic improvement from MW2. IW and Sledgehammer packed loads of content into MW3’s spec ops. 16 missions, survival and chaos made it a lot of fun. Multiplayer- I’m not gonna lie, the multiplayer maps are pretty mediocre. But solid weapons and killstreaks keep you invested in it. And amazingly, micro transactions aren’t blown in your face! The developers had the ‘if you want it, go and earn it’ kind of attitude back then.. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, FPS fans will have their fun with this title. On the other hand, if you played the first two Modern Warfare games, you get nothing new here. Fast action-filled battles, a short but thrilling single-player campaign and a pretty fun multiplayer. And after all this fun, MW 3 is just like the FIFA franchise. Everything warmed up, not good, not bad, just mediocre!. Big step down from MW2. Graphically, gameplay wise, and story. Has strong moments but a cookie cutter conclusion.. Definitely one of the best first-person shooter games and the best trilogy ever. All three games are a must-play for a complete experience.. Oh boy, Modern Warfare 3... I was very excited for this one. Once it was announced back in 2011, I just knew I had to Pre-Order it... But once the game had finally released, I was a bit disappointed. The game is literally the same as Modern Warfare 2, the User-Interface looks the same, many of the weapons are just taken from Modern Warfare 2, and they really destroyed the Nuke in this game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. the story concludes the trilogy in a bitter sweet fashion but it is a perfect ending for the best call of duty trilogy. Each new Call of Duty release has now become a truly global event as the hype machine builds towards its launch. Anyone who is a fan of the franchise will be getting exactly what they expect for their money. The campaign is as action packed as ever but even at just four hours long it became a bit of a chore to play through as it offers little that hasn’t already been seen in previous entries in the series. Other criticisms that could be levelled at any Call of Duty game, such as an over reliance on scripted events and sections with infinitely respawning enemies, also still apply here. On occasions it is easy to get wrapped up in everything that is going on but for me these instances were the exception rather than the rule. Online multiplayer has also changed very little aside from a few new perks. The maps themselves are however rather disappointing this time around, none of them are downright poor but none could really be considered a true classic in the same way as Crash or Overgrown from previous games. In fact there is a distinct lack of variety in the maps with none really offering the opportunity for sniping or long range combat (although some may see this as a good thing I suppose). The Special Ops missions from Modern Warfare 2 also return and provide a good selection of challenging co-op game. In the end, despite the fact that the formula is now starting to wear a little thin, it seems as though the majority of people aren’t disappointed with Modern Warfare 3 as sales yet again reached record numbers.. Played on XBOX 360. Gameplay: GOOD. Story: GOOD. Graphic: GOOD. Music/Sound: GOOD. Dialogue/Voice Acting: GOOD.. One of the BEST Game i've ever played... I am Sorry for the People who add Low Rate for This Amazing Game, They're Don't Deserve an Amazing game Like This... They're Not Gamer at All...Piss Off.... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The third and final installment of Modern Warfare is great, but not exceptionally satisfying as its predecessors. The all-in-one package of this game is still good especially survival mode in spec ops, but everything felt sleazy that seemed like the developers just copy and pasted the game from MW2 with no actual effort being put into it after Jason West and Vince Zampella got fired from Activision for associated with EA on Battlefield: Bad Company 2.. This game is game of the year. That year is 2007. There are barely any noticable improvements, apart from new maps and a few new weapons. The gameplay is stale, and if you have been playing COD since COD4, you will experience fatigue with this release. The same rehashed gameplay, with literally the same textures from MW2. A solid expansion pack, however if you release a retail game, expect to be treated like one.. Great campaign, great multiplayer, amazing spec ops and survival! One of the best COD's in history. I highly recommend it!. Modern Warfare 3 has my personal favorite multiplayer in any Call of Duty game. It's kind of a shame it's got so many negative reviews.... ""Modern Warfare 3"" isn't great like its predecessors, but it's still terrific. Developed by Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games, it feels more like an extension of MW 2 than a true sequel. Regardless, this installment still provides plenty of great content. The campaign is an entertaining conclusion to the Modern Warfare storyline. The competitive multiplayer introduced Kill Confirmed, a series mainstay. Cooperative modes included several new Spec Ops missions and Survival maps, both great fun. This COD game doesn't innovative as much as it greatly entertains. I would rate it with an 8.8 out of 10.. Although I had a ton of fun with MW3, the game relies too heavily on its predecessor MW2's ideas and feels more like an expansion of MW2 than a brand new game. Still overall a very fun game with solid maps and a very fun Infected mode.. It isn’t without its flaws, but it delivers as a fun first person shooter, and that is all it really needs. Rating - 80%. Story is at maximum good, not passing this, maybe the best (if it means something) in COD series. The point is only passing the time playing with friends and online, in aspect fun you can spend hours and hours with the game, the only reason for releasing a COD for year with the same engine and playability. In short, a game for the masses.. I've always felt that this is the Call of Duty game that has the most replay value due to one vital component that has kept me coming back to it: Survival Mode. Everything else is forgettable re-dos of MW2, but Survival Mode and the new Missions from the Special Ops mode will certainly keep me open to jumping back into what I would consider my favorite game in the series!. I always find myself coming back to this masterpiece. Solid story and an entertaining multiplayer experience that will have you plugging countless amount of hours into.. Wait... it's already over? Campaign is really like 5 maps? Really? And I paid what for this **** Yeah... mistakes were made in the purchasing of this.. i gave up on these game a little bit after MW2. when the game seemed to be nothing but 12 yr olds running around with shotguns & sprint perks or just using rockets & noobtubes. So i never cared really when i saw the teaser trailer for MW3. But they never stop my little brother from making the mistake of buying it. So i decided to see if it lived up to any of the hype it supposedly would live up to. I was so disgusted with what i saw, it was literally an exact copy of MW2. with a hybrid leveling system used from black ops. And like anyone really wants to play such an old outdated engine. If anyone really wanted to play this game it be best if you just bought the previous versions, you save your hard earned cash and you dont lose any benefits. 0/10. Modern Warfare 3 was one of my least favorite call of duty games. I loved Modern Warfare 2 and think that it is one of the best call of duty games ever made, but I felt like Modern Warfare 3 deviated from the spirit and gameplay of Modern Warfare 2. The maps weren't done well, the guns felt over powered at time and I never really had much fun. That is why I will give it a 6.1.. Absolute rubbish! Patches do nothing to improve it! Multiplayer is poor. lag, campers, overpowered shot guns, bad hit detection, hackers, aimbots! List goes on and on! I'm never buying a CoD game ever again, RIP CoD!!! The dev's really dont care unless they are making $$$$$. This is the worst of the Modern Warfare series, but still a good game. Felt like they over-reached for a shock moment, and the story telling is not as fresh as it was for Modern Warfares 1 and 2. Happy these guys are now making Titanfall and showing their extreme talent in that new franchise.. Modern Warfare 3 is a massive disappointment on almost every level within the context of the previous games and not those that would follow. Based on how MW2 ended it's campaign, there was going to be a inevitable sequel, but I was very concern with what that sequel would entail. The campaign was just a mess of plot holes, little character development and railroading of epic proportions for its big action moments. A convoluted multiplayer system that retreaded back much of what Black Ops established on top of numerous problems, a survival system that was lazily tacked on to try to be like zombies but fail almost miserably and a spec ops system that was still good, but still had the same problems MW2's version had and was never fixed. I did not think the reverb from Black Ops to MW3 would be so loud that it would make me tone deaf, because the noise of everything the game was trying to throw at me was just completely exhausting to listen to. The commercialization of the game was far more important than the game itself as far as I was concern. To fair however, I still had fun with the game. a 6/10 is often seen as a failing grade in the mainstream media of critics and players, but I thought MW3 was decent, alright and/or okay. It did still have cool campaign moments that made it feel like a big dumb action flick, the spec ops was still good and some charm was found in pockets on the multiplayer. It's just a dam shame again that it sunk so low on quality and the idea of war just doesnt exist. It's completely barren from the game's entire being. It might have a war in the background, but the feeling and pacing just eradicates any sense of the idea. MW3 is not a bad game, but not really a good game. Just my view though now looking back as a adult with a critical mind.. Although Infinity Ward created some pretty fun filled Call of Duty games in the past. Modern Warfare 3 is a step down from the original modern warfare games. This one isn't as inspired or creative as the first two games however this doesn't make it a bad triple A shooter game. As even with its weaknesses Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 remains a strong video game. Campaign: My initials thoughts for Modern Warfare 3's campaign was fun, explosive and big. And I got exactly that. When I stepped into the campaign of Modern Warfare 3 I was greeted to one of the best Call of Duty Campaign openers. I loved how fast and explosive it feltI loved how the game didn't run to far away from its Call of Duty style. I loved the story and the way it is told. There are somethings I was disappointed in with the campaign. The main thing would just be how it feels to much like its trying to be a film not a video game. However set that aside Call of Duty MW3s campaign is almost as good at Modern Warfare 1 and 2's campaign Campaign: 8/10 Multiplayer: Although Call of Duty is mainly known for its explosive multiplayer I felt as if 2011's Call of Duty felt too similar to MW2. TOO SIMILAR. The map layouts were very similar and even the graphics didn't look any different. The weapons were the same and the multiplayer mode just felt like it was MW2's original Multiplayer however they decided to scrap it and throw it in to MW3. However the multiplayer can be fun if you really enjoyed MW2's. It isn't anything new however its still an exceptable addition to Call of Duty MW3. Multiplayer: 6.8/10 Survival: Survival is the newest addition to Infinity Wards Call of Duty MW3. And it may as well be the strongest. Survival mode is something new and something unique. Adapting from Zombies treyarch formula the game made a third mode and mode that was especially fun to play. I found myself enjoying Survival mode alot. And that it was very fun with friends. This was an addition to MW3's Call of Duty mode that was probably the best. Making it Infinity Wards next go to third gamemode. I feel as if they should bring back Survival mode for their next call of duty. Its fun and feels innovative. Unfortunately the gamemode doesn't have an actual story so you just run around random maps shooting hoards of enemies. Still very fun. Survival: 8/10 Verdict. 2011's Call of Duty was the first weakest addition to Activisions growing Call of Duty franchise however it still came out to be a funfilled and enjoyable experience. Pros: -Good Campaign and Story Telling -Really Fun Survival Mode -Multiplayer Mode adapts from MW2 Cons: -Weak Multiplayer, too similar to MW2. -Game Breaking Glitchs Overall: 7.6/10. The live multiplayer game is very frustrating and unforgiving for the average player. It is extremely difficult to see enemy players and protect one's six. I am far more successful in later versions such as Black Ops II and Ghosts. But this game simply isn't any fun for the less experienced player. I felt so much better after ejecting the disc, breaking it into small pieces, and throwing it in the trash.. Liked the campaign as much like the other two modern warfare where now Russia has declared war on Germany US UK and France to emotional and good ,the multiplayer just felt like Mw2 it wasn't that much of a change.. The game that ruined Call of Duty. Probably the worst one they ever did. This is the game where hit detection went out the window and every game since has been similar. Avoid at all costs. Wouldn't even take it for free.. A lot of people are giving this game bad reviews, especially a lot of user reviews. But i personally think that this game is the best in the Modern Warfare series. The storytelling is amazing told, and it isn't that far in the future. Voice acting is of course on point, and the multiplayer is also the best in the series. I was on the edge of my seat till the end. This game is alright overall. My favorite game was infected and drop zone, but some of the other modes I didn't enjoy as much as previous games. this game could have used some more effort in production.. All Series Call of Duty MW is good . In MW3 many awesome and good moments . MW3 one of the best game in Call of Duty Series . Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 very interesting shooter , but this game has got not really good graphics . Graphics in Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 3 a little better than graphics in Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare . Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is good game . 8/10 .. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. when you shoot someone with a sniper there's to many hit markers. not only that there's too many hackers on-line which spoils the gaming experience because they get high prestige levels and all the guns. the only good thing about the game is the survival waves where you have to shoot the enemies and one juggernaut in the first round. and the ending where Markov dies.. Once again Sledgehammer and Infinity ward has farted out another lackluster Call Of Duty title, Modern Warfare 3, MW3 barely improves upon MW2, the HUD is exactly the same, the guns are exactly the same, and the campaign, is kinda interesting, but not enough that you'd want to slog through it. Don't buy this game, you will regret it. Buy Skyrim instead.. If you liked any of the others in the series, this one is worth trying out at the very least. The co-op mode is a bit more in the style of gears of war, but that actually works pretty well. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. If you want a game to pick up real easy and get invested for a looooooooonng time, Call of Duty got your back. This game has a great story campaign to dive in (however it's like 4-5 hours long soooo....). And the multiplayer is fantastic for playing with your friends. If you don't have friends, multiplayer is still a great mode to compete against and work together with other players around the world. Not long. Not short. Just perfect to jump in and jump out! (Although, you must be warned that the online community is a bit toxic in which 9-15 year old kids starts to scream at each other for no reason at all...) Special Ops is alright.. A step back for call of duty. Essentially was MW2 level graphics with worse gameplay and maps. Campaign was satisfying though, especially at the end.... Modern Warfare is back with a bang. This time developers Sledgehammer team up with Infinity Ward, bringing gaming’s elite together for the third instalment of the Modern Warfare franchise. Previous release (MW2) gripped players through endless multi-player action online, and (some of the time) the accompanying campaign mode. Modern Warfare 3 dives straight into the action and Russia is on America’s doorstep threatening invasion. Soap and Price are back and with the help of Frost, Nikolai and new guy Yuri (to name a few). Primary antagonist Makarov is back too, hijacking the plane of President Vorshevsky and kidnapping his daughter Alena to add leverage to his insane bid to gain launch codes for the Russian Nuclear Arsenal. I was taken back by all the gunfire, explosions and attention to detail brought forward in MW3, and while the game engine is still the same as before, buildings, characters and scenery all looking amazing. The cut scenes too are well done bringing the story to life with verve and drama. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3Campaign Mode is all gripping, tense and thrilling. Spanning over several months, from land, air and sea with a vast array of weaponry, non repetitive objectives and an easy to follow heads up display. Difficulty changes are noticeable calling players to use a deeper tactical approach if Veteran is your forte. Co-op Campaign is still a no-go and something the game is really missing. We do though see the Special Ops Mode return, with less stars","MW3 2011 was goated game, and you give bad reviews to other games . an almost carbon copy of modern warfare 2, with a 10/10 story line and FPS walkthrough . i spent hours and I mean hours on this game and time and time again I find myself quiting to play anything else ."
519.What Remains of Edith Finch,"Yes just a walking simulator but for me personally it is the best walking simulator that ever existed and the story is one of the best you could do in a walking simulator. Hardly a game but that's not even my issue, it's that people tout this as some strong emotional journey but in reality it's a bunch of unfortunate stories that no one cares about. Like I'm sorry but I just don't care that family member 64 in video game 1864 killed themselves. The only redeeming quality of this game is that the art direction is actually quite good.. Gameplay 7 Graphic 8 Sound 8 Enterteinment 6 Longevity 6 Story 8 Total =7,5. Probably the best walking simulator out there. Plot is excellent and engaging. It's only about 3-4 hours long but the storytelling style, voice acting and the script are top-notch. Graphics look nice and there are no long load times or any glaring issues. I'm not normally a fan of walking simulators but this one I do recommend that everyone plays just for the plot.. I'm shocked, what a good game. What I liked the most is how creative it is, and it never stops, I enjoyed it from start to finish. When it comes to the actual gameplay, it's pretty much a walking simulator, but the minigames are actually fun, and the environment looks very pretty, I love the art-style. The story is easily my favorite aspect of the game, it's just so... depressing... exploring the mansion made me feel uneasy at times, seeing all those people who used to live here die, it's such a unique concept, I adore it. Even if this is not your type of game, I still recommend it, it's only 2-3 hours long, and totally worth experiencing. Final Rating: ""Great"" ~ 8/10. What a story. What a captivating experience. What a cautionary tale. I can't think **** that had me this hooked for its duration. While its 2-hour length likely played a part, I haven't stopped thinking about it since I finished it. Games with vague stories often mistake ambiguity for good storytelling, but often those games have no resolution. They're meant to go unsolved. What Remains of Edith Finch has sinister undertones within the walls of this house of horrors, and like Edith herself, it's up to you (the player) to unravel the mystery behind the curse for yourself.. maybe the best example of story driven videogame ""what remains of edith finch"" even amuses with well implemented, yet simple, gameplay ideas. The living proof that videogames can just be a display of strong emotions and life lessons. Once i thought firewatch was the best walking sim. Then i played this. Genuinely a funny and emotional masterpiece.. I am a happily married husband and father of 2 children I drink my coffee every morning and go to a job that I love work till noon and come back to my loving wife and children and we have a lovely dinner together and my wonderful life is more depressing than this game. I didn't catch a thing that why this game is called tragic. grow out of it.. 《What Remains of Edith Finch》 is an acclaimed exploration and adventure game. The core idea of the game revolves around storytelling, presenting a complex and profound narrative about family heritage and fate through the perspectives of various **** story is one of the highlights of the game, filled with mystery and allure. Each character has their own unique tale that intertwines with the family history. By exploring different environments and scenes, players gradually uncover the secrets of the family members and their destinies. These stories touch upon different themes such as love, loss, loneliness, and death, leaving a deep impression on players.However, the game's storytelling heavily relies on a stream of consciousness style, making certain parts of the game difficult to comprehend. Some plot elements seem to lack logic or a clear purpose, making it hard for players to understand their significance. This stream of consciousness presentation may confuse some players or disrupt the overall coherence of the game.Nevertheless, the game is still worth experiencing. Its story is filled with emotion and profundity, prompting players to contemplate life and fate. The game's unique style and exquisite art design provide players with a distinct exploration experience. Despite some confusing parts, overall, ""What Remains of Edith Finch"" is a unique and captivating game.. this game's s story is amazing. one of the best games of all time. It shows the story in such a brilliant and creative way.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. As I don't have much time to play, any game with a short duration is welcome. It tells the story of the Finch family, focusing on each member. The gameplay is limited (just moving), but there are some beautiful mechanics that encompass the story telling. While the global story is not perfect and I think there is material for something bigger, I really enjoyed some of the short chapters.. This is a walking simulator with a very captivating, mysterious, and heartbreaking story. The real star of the show is the art direction. The way the story is told is extremely creative and really complements the direction they went with the art and graphics. At just 2 hours long, there's no real reason not to play the game to completion.. Beautifu. I feel the fall of the house of usher here. One of the best stories ever.. A moving story thightly bound with some of the most innovative gameplay mechanics in any game to date.. Honestly a masterpiece. I went in hearing that this was good, normally with hype I go the opposite direction and end up hating the hyped up product. This actually exceeded my expectations. Excellent game that will make you feel something.. A baeutiful and haunting game that will take you on a very emotional journey.. This game gives me a sense of feeling that it no longer can be call a game, it's a art!. Great atmosphere and memorable game. 8/10 gameplay 9/10 graphics 10/10 story 10/10 environments. A perfect and creative indie game. You have to interpret a lot yourself to understand the story. But that's what makes it so special. This is such a beautiful game, if anything I’ve played should be considered a pice of art then this is it. Edith Finch is essential an exploration game with a deep and moving story about a family’s tragic history which is told though interesting little gameplay segments, each one different to the last. It’s only a few hours long and definitely worth getting if you haven’t played it.. All style. Very little substance. Overrated. Definition of oscar-bate for a """"""""game"""""""""". No wonder it got such ""high prise"". It's an ideal product for a pretentious critic who wants to think about herself/himself as an art critic connoisseur. Actually pretty dumb. All that creativity could have been something great if someone had an actual direction for these people instead o everything everywhere at once and ""every idea must be used"" tossed into a blender. Surface level artsy-fartsy for people who think of themself as ""open-minded"". If this game was a person it would be a person that just talks a lot, doesn't bring anything into the end, and is not able to control it's own emotions, just without any consistency or self-control jumps from subject to subject on a whim, while also being addicted to self-adoration and in need of validation. Like a borderline or something. Maybe it actually is a game for borderline or something. For such high prise that this game got it was one of the blandest GAMING experiences, I had in the last few years. If not for the high prise the game it would be 5 not 3. That is all.. If you're into that type of games you will probably give it a 9 or a 10, but honestly I don't play this type of games a lot but even tho, I give it an 8. the gameplay is simple you will use joysticks and another button only. We know that the story in these games is the most important, so the story is very beautiful, every one have a story behind and deep meanings and the way they tell you their story is absolutely amazing, I was about to cry many times, So like I said before if you are into that type of games, it is worth buying and you will give it like a 9 or 10. What remains of Edith Finch is a pretty walking simulator that tells the story of the Finch family. Impersonate Edith, coming back to your empty family house after several years, explore it, and learn its secrets. You'll discover what happened to your relatives, and you'll be able to make your own reasoning behind the story of this family. The game is artistically well done, the house is interesting and the story flows smoothly. By visiting the house, you'll unlock several separate game section which will tell you the story of one of your relatives. These sections are imaginative and always different, so you will be entertained and you won't know what to expect next. The game is completely linear and there is no difficulty, you just need to walk and follow the story. It takes around two hours to be ended and don't really have any replayability, unless you want to go for achievements, which will add one hour at the most. While the plot is interesting, it's just a little, dark and cryptic story around a family that will certainly make you think, but I feel that it isn't so deep and don't convey any particular message. I played this game for ""free"" through the Playstation Extra subscription, and I was positevely entertained for the short time needed to play it, but I wouldn't be so happy about it if I had to pay real money, so I believe that whoever is interested in playing this needs to consider that it's super short and that you mostly watch the game and move in a linear path, but in case you are still interested, you will probably enjoy the experience!. Very good and enjoyable few hour game. Interesting story with all little details and i can recommend this game all who like story games. Story: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Graphics: 9/10 Animation: 9/10. Another walking simulator that you don’t even use the buttons other than the left stick, but this time with a great story behind.. This could possibly be the best indie game ever made. (Either this or Journey.) This game is deep, impactful, emotional, introspective, nuanced, atmospheric, beautiful, haunting, incredibly well written, has stellar voice acting and an incredible artistic direction. Definitely a game more mature people will like.. A Morbid, cynical and death-glorifying ""game"" for suicidal mfs. The gameplay revolves around committing suicide and watching people (mostly children) die. Every brainlet would say something very like this ""ABSOLUTE AND UNMISSABLE MASTERPIECE, MOVING AND INCREDIBLY IMMERSIVE."" Yet, the game is a walking simulator with a ""commit suicide"" button, the stories about characters' deaths are very bizarre, easily avoidable and glorified by the narration. The game is a two hour long emetic experience made by immoral sick bucks. There are games that tell dead people's stories without repulsive elements. Kena Bridge of Spirits. And on the top of that you play as 20 weeks pregnant 17yo girl.. It is one of those games that Sony gave for free with the PlayStation Plus subscription and that I didn’t care to play until I had nothing else on my plate, and to my surprise it is an excellent game. You can finish it in 3 hours, give or take, but it is worth any penny you pay for it (should you had paid for it).. Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions. (10) Outstanding. A truly elite title that is nearly perfect in every way. This score is given out rarely and indicates a game that cannot be missed. This game revolves you digging into a family’s past, filled with death. Each story of a family member is unique, moving and immersive. I’ve replayed this game quite a few times throughout the years since its release. There is very little gameplay so if you just want to watch it instead, go right ahead. Just don’t pass up on the story and please support the game by still buying it.. The amount of animal cruelty in this game is striking. It's never questioned, or commented on; it's just there. Most people will be numb to it, but the lack of empathy (towards non-human animals) on display is significant. ""I want you to be amazed that any of us ever had a chance to be here at all."" If that's the message the developers want to convey, their portrayal of unquestioned violence does it a disservice. If the above is true, surely all life would have value, and people would choose not to cause suffering. As such, I can't imagine the developers made a conscious choice depicting this amount of gratuitous brutality.. Really Good game with an original way of telling a story. Everyone should give it a try.. WROEF is a masterpiece in its own kind, just sad that it's too short. It might be the most creative piece of nostalgia that I ever experienced.. An immersive story that engages in compelling storytelling and narrative. However, some of the stories of the characters told here are lackluster, and there are moments where boredom sets in and the game becomes somewhat of a drag. Overall it's a strong game with a cool and unique concept but it doesn't always execute its concept to its full potential.. This game is simply a masterpiece. I normally don’t care about stories but this one had me glued. It’s short but sometimes that’s what I want.. What remains of Edith Finch is magnificent. Developers from Giant Sparrow have done an incredible job to mixing up Visual Novel and Action Adventure game elements, and combining them into one unforgettable experience. The plot tells us about a pregnant woman Edith Finch whose goal is to create a diary for her child about her siblings and parents, and every time before you interact with the memory to write to your diary you see a unique story of every family member and what happened to them ( what killed or caused death ), and I’ve gotta admit that every story of her relatives is very interesting and visually done at great **** from every story my favorite is Lewises story, that shows his mental issues and it has the best direction and visual design amongst all the stories. Soundtrack is good but I’ve only remembered main theme of the game, but still soundtrack completes atmosphere of locations and sometimes it can be really dramatic, and just hide the fright of situation ( like in Gregoris story ). 8/10. *7.5* What remains of Edith Finch - a great story packed in a short captivating game.. If you're looking for a fun, sad, and dense story game, this is for you. This took me maybe 1.5 hours to beat, and it took me for a ride.. I loved this. As I am just getting into games, this was perfect for me. Interesting, well-paced, fairly easy to navigate as a newbie, and the story unfolded beautifully. Highly recommend.. Beautiful and unique experience. I thought this game was going to be like depressive but it was not. Nostalgic, heartwarming, sometimes heartbreaking, and overall this game felt very human.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Intriguing storyline told in highly creative ways. However, being a video game, of a medium drawing (one of) its (most important) strength(s) from interaction, a walking simulator never achieves that particular feeling which makes the games great. Worth to mention that there are mini-game mechanics in every chapter but mainly you are left with the feeling of walking while observing around. For anyone with mental-health issues running in the family (especially the ones transmitted genetically), the story of the game can give them another point of view, help them take some distance to see the overview and better yet, a lot of hope. Note that for me 6/10 is not a ""bad"" rating. The game sufficiently scores above the average, and it will not be a waste of time or money for anyone. But unless its gameplay mechanics or story is a personal preference for the player, it does not achieve that extra something which can make it a solid ""good"" (7/10) game. Though I don't think it ever aims to achieve that, and it's completely OK because I think creating an artistic indie game is not about aiming for the top quality game-development goals in every aspect. Long story in short, neither this game is bad or underachieving, nor my rating is unfair.. If you're going to write a book, write a book. If you're going to make a movie, make a movie. If you're going to make a video game, please, for the love of God, make it interactive. I just sat through a three hour movie that forced me to hold a controller the entire time for no reason. But hey, I actually played through it, unlike 99% of the reviewers here who are sniffing their own farts after watching a trailer.. What Remains of Edit Fitch on PS5 Game Completed : Nov 7, 2021 100% trophy Playtime : 4 hours It creates its own nitch and delivers its own genre and it works. 90% of its success is from its art style and narrative. Its a 10/10. At the end of the day, its a very short game and an indie game. This is one of those hidden gem. If you are craving for out of this world experience you should try this game. A deep emotional interactive story packed full with sadness. We definitely need more serious stories in video games like this.. Not interesting gameplay because it's just a walking simulator, but the storytelling was beautiful and amazing.. As a pure exercise to demonstrate in how many different ways a videogame can make use of different narrative techniques this is a master piece. As a videogame it's just a mediocre walking simulator with clunky controls, predictable ending and weird tone.. A unique experience where the story of the game let you involved in try to discover what really happened to the family, the visual is beautiful, everything is perfect in this game.. Just speechless, I didn’t really know what to expect of this game before playing it. Really neat details and catches you like a wind.. Haven't had a game's story grip me like this in a while. The premise is so unique and amazing and the the heartbreaking stories unfold in some of the most creative ways I've ever seen in a video game. It's really short and there's not much gameplay as you're more of a passenger through the game; but it'll stick with you after playing it.. Honestly the worst game I ever played. Super overrated. Everyone loves the story, I dont. And the gameplay is objectibely horrible. I played this game without knowing what to expect, and it's basic if you want to enjoy it how the developers intended you to do. This is a game to end in a day, think about it a couple days and forget it so you can replay it in a couple years and reminisce the feelings.. This game reminds us,that we all will die. But, although,its very cool stories of people.. It's the Vanishing of Ethan Carter but more whimsical and less satisfying. It's a storybook. You get a dozen little vignettes. The game sets up what you think might be a mystery or some sort of thread between stories, but really they're completely unrelated and there are no answers. I'm fine with that; I like art games. I just wouldn't have been so disappointed if the game didn't heavily imply there was some sort of mystery at the bottom of all of it. Like throughout the game you see these missing person posters about your brother and how your Mom never believed he was dead. You eventually find his room and you get NO information about how or if he died. I would mark this as a spoiler, but it's actually a complete non-spoiler because there's no information revealed in the game, so it has no effect on the plot. I feel like Firewatch, Gone Home, and Ethan Carter have decent stories. This game, Unfinished Swan, and Everybody's Gone To The Rapture are walking Sims that convey a place and time, but lack the story to really hold the experience together. Maybe that's just me, but I think a walking sim needs a strong satisfying narrative to work.. The story 10/10, gameplay 10/10, soundtrack 7/10, characters 8/10, world 7/10, atmosphere 9/10. It is very short but the gameplay and the story are very good. Hours played: 5. Amazing storytelling and fantasy, this game felt like reading a fantasy book. The gameplay was great and it combined a lot of gameplay styles with really creative ways. I think I only scratched the surface of this game and I would love to play it once more to get the full grasp of its story, as even the rooms and objects in them have a story to tell. This isn't a difficult game but if you are into stories I definitely recommend it. What remains of Edith Finch is a game I won't forget.. Fresh direction shines. The static but immersive way of telling the story isn't boring. But that's all. It might be enough for a game like this.. A unique and unmatched experience in any game so far, also a manifestation of how powerful indie games can be. The intriguing, suspenseful story is smoothly woven into its creative and versatile gameplay. Surprises and wow moments are intensely placed during the 2 hour journey. Among the highlights, the fish chopping scene is one of the most memorable moments in gaming.. The game travels through memories and grief in a beautiful way. The soundtrack is sweet and the voice acting is really great, passing realistic feelings through a unique narrative, making you feel like you're a member of the family aswell. The game lenght is perfectly enough to conclude the history in amazing style, extraordinary game! O jogo viaja por memórias e luto de uma maneira linda. A trilha sonora é tranquila e a dublagem é muito boa, passando sentimentos realistas através de uma narrativa única, fazendo você se sentir como se fosse um membro da família também. A duração do jogo é perfeitamente completa para completar a história em um estilo incrível, jogo extraordinário!. Normally I couldn't care less about the story in a game, since most developers have NOTHING of interest to say. I don't want to hear your fauxlisophical nonsense from your zero life experience to draw from. I just want to play a game. I heard it was 3 hours long and people I trust on YouTube and whatnot said it was worth it. Like most, I picked it up with my PS+ and played it. It was a great story, actually brought tears to my eyes. I like depressing things, seek them out in movies. If it ends in a tragedy, I'm a happy customer. The only thing I can knock this game for, is the controls. While minimal, I'm not a huge fan of ""simulating"" actions. I want a button to turn the page, I don't want to move the joystick to the right and then left to simulate the action. Swinging on the swings is fine. But I was having issue turning the page, since I'd go too fast and it would fall back down, accidently added too much upward push on the joystick. It was annoying. Other than that, everything else was spot on. I thought it dealt with mental disorders in a neat and non-patronising way and also simulated them well enough in the framework of the narrative. Especially that one part where you have to do two very different actions at once. HIGHLY recommend it. It's one of those that you can show to non-gamers and they'd get something out of it, if the subject matter suits them.. A masterpiece of an indie game, What Remains of Edith Finch is a big contender for my favorite game of all time with its amazing story and beautiful soundtrack. A mustily for all fans of story driven games.. Really good game, I teared up a bit in the end. It's kinda short but I'm not unsatisfied.. Wow. This is one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had. The story is just amazing, wish I could play it again for the first time.. The game is just pure story which is very nice really movie or book like and it makes it really nice. Short nice story good gameplay as for free in ps+ is a very fair option. Slow paced walk-sim. The main story is actually quite interesting. The game's premise sounds good too: here is this huge, abandoned mansion, explore it, and learn about the family's dark history. The truth is a bit further away. The exploration is extremely coordinated, and the game lets you (accidentally) skip parts - but you can never go back. Some of the sub-stories are way too short. There is a great variety in the storytelling: but it's quite a hit or miss. I really enjoyed the part where I was a cat, the end of the sub-mission really made me have goosebumps. And then there is the one when you are playing on a swing... Sometimes there is actual 3d interaction with the surroundings, other times you are reading a letter, or skimming through a comic book. Anyway... it's a ""press X, and read"" game for the most part. I don't regret buying this game. Is it on sale, and you don't have it yet? Go for it. But I will not fire it up again to see the parts I missed the first time I played.. Love the storytelling of this game. Each character has its own story with its own style and the addition of all the substories really ads well up. The game is short. Maybe some more depth here and there could have been beneficial. But on average, the story really quickly catches the player’s (and viewer’s) attention thanks to epic ambiance, storytelling, mystery and music. Apart from length, the downsides of this game lay in its technical quality. The frames per second are super low on PS4 and it hinders the immersion of the game several times. Simplicity is also another trait of this game that can be seen as negative depending on what the player wants this type of game to be. That said, the experience that this game offers is enjoyable unique and therefore you should not hesitate to give it a go.. I didn't really care for this game at all. I didn't feel the story was very cohesive or compelling, It's a walking simulator/art gallery with set-pieces to me, nothing more. Story was meh.. An interactive surreal novel. Dive into an immersive drama told by whom is left of Finch family. If you enjoy a good story and some exploration, this is, hands down, a go to.. What Remains of Edith Finch is an interesting collection of stories about the deaths of the members of Edith's family. It's a short 2 hour game and it manages to pack a lot of variety into that runtime. The stories are all presented in different ways and all play differently. There's a couple of standout moments that are really worth experiencing for yourself, including the fish cannery scene and the bathtub scene. The cannery scene in particular is brilliant in its depiction of the monotony of a dull life and it's effects on a young man. It's a fascinating, powerful part of the game that benefits from the interactivity of the medium. Although some stories are better than others, they're all worthwhile. On the gameplay side of things, this is more involved than you might expect from a walking simulator. As the player, you have enough to do beyond watching and listening to keep you invested in the game which also helps further connect you with the characters. The game flirts with different styles and tones, and graphically this game does look pretty good. The performance isn't totally stable but it's not much of an issue in a game like this. I don't really have a lot to critique or discuss for What Remains of Edith Finch because it's one of those games that's worth just experiencing for yourself, and I don't want to spoil all of the specifics. It's a strong title, and one that triumphs on the narrative front. It's a compelling journey exploring the huge Finch house and discovering the tragic fates of its inhabitants. It's not a totally consistent journey, but it's highs are excellent. Overall, I enjoyed the game but it didn't blow me away.. Simple, yet great, for what it is i'm very glad I played it. Was just an amazing short story that is totally worth playing.. Wow, this was such a unique gaming experience, I've never played anything like it. It's more like participating in a story than playing a game. So incredibly creative and immersive and captivating. The story is tragic, dark, beautiful and heartfelt all at the same time. It is short, so don't expect the experience to last very long. I would recommend it for anyone interested in a novel gaming experience.. I've been playing my back catalogue of games since we all have more time and Edith Finch drew me in and I played it in one sitting. I really appreciate the way they told this story and the ending was something I didn't see coming. You can miss so much in this game and that's what makes the exploration and attention to detail is so great!. What remains of Edith Finch is certainly impressive in terms of its visual style and execution, with each chapter sporting a different overall style, from playing a comic book to chopping fish while exploring an imaginary world. The story overall goes for a sed melancholic tone, and while the story is very good, it isn't a masterpiece by any means. Visually the game is rather impressive, but while some areas of the game are stunning, e.g the lobby of the house and the route leading to the house, some areas like the comic book section look rather rushed. Attention to detail is quite good, every room genuinely feels different, and are all packed with items that exasperate the feel of the room. However, with its very linear 2-hour playtime the game sadly isn't worth a re-play unless you miss something major.. A truly unique game. I had played it because it was free on PS Plus. I enjoyed every bit of it. And this is coming from a person that doesn't really play these sorts of indie like, short games. It is a simple plot with many moments that are truly magnificent and awe inspiring. I had to think some things twice to realise their greatness. It's still a simple game, but I believe it succeeded in every way.. Rarely can you find such a fine ""walking simulator"". This game grabs the most boring genre but turns it into something fresh, something unique, and special. The story is a sublime and refined masterpiece and it doesn't stretch for more than 4 hours, allowing it to not get stale or boring but remains for a long time on your mind and makes you think. What Remains of Edith Finch is a linear cinematic experience. Let's get that straight, it's a game suited for even non-gamers and if you're looking for action you came to the wrong place. I haven't played such a good ""walking simulator"" since Journey back in the PS3 days.. ABSOLUTE AND UNMISSABLE MASTERPIECE, MOVING AND INCREDIBLY IMMERSIVE. An incredibly beautiful video game that deals with the theme of death from different causes and in different ways with a delicacy and sweetness never seen before in any other media. In addition, the gameplay that becomes a real expedient to tell the story of this family is a great way to further increase immersion (already incredibly high thanks to the very detailed, lovingly cared for game world, and the best narrative I have of mine seen in a video game) in history. From a technical point of view, the game is very good and is aging really well.. Proof that ""walking simulators"" can be stylish and properly utilize the medium, unlike the hollow, pretentious nonsense of Dear Esther and Gone Home. The cannery stage is my personal highlight of this game as quite possibly the best gameplay representation of spacing out at work.. Through her journal we see Edith recount her last visit to her old family home, and ","the story is one of the best you could do in a walking simulator . it's only about 3-4 hours long but the storytelling style, voice acting and the script are top-notch . it's pretty much a walking simulator, but the minigames are actually fun ."
52.God of War,"This game is an absolute masterpiece. If you need to play a good game for 40 hours or something this is your game. The history is perfect. SO PEAK GAME! I completed it in about a week and did not regret a single minute spent in this game. The game is good in everything, atmosphere, plot, characters, environment, secondary quests, combat and leveling systems.. Took god of war to the next level with amazing graphics, story, musi, gameplay and difficulty. One ofthe best PS4 games. The game looks nice. The story is better than the original ones. Combat is much slower & much more like Dark Souls than God of War. Boss variety is limited.. one of the best games ever cinematographic and history thw best way possible of an reboot of the franchise. A must play for everyone who likes a good story, pick this game up. And even better on pc. Honestly, I found it boring and tedious. Looks good but it's not at all compelling. Corridor driven hack and slash with talking. Boring. I also find the relationship between father and son to be disturbing, bitter and full of sadness.. Keeping it at a 9 solely because I have not played a lot of narrative driven video games and I want to leave a 10 rating open just in case there is in fact a game better than this, which I honestly don't know if that is possible. This is the best game I have ever played and anyone who wants to play a video game with an interesting story and absolutely beautiful world will be satisfied if this is the game they choose to play. Great game, I cannot praise it enough.. Great story game with fun combat, but its slightly overrated in my opinion. As I said, the combat is fun, but its never really that engaging in my opinion. furthermore there is a lack of enemy and boss variety wich adds to the sometimes repetitive feeling combat. Another thing that does not really feel engaging are the puzzles, wich are too simple and just kinda boring. The story is the strongest part of the game. Worth playing, especially for the price it goes for nowadays. Great world and also amazing plot, it s a game that you must play . Top 10 my best game i played recently. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The end of the game changed my rating from 5.5 to 7. I found it hard to follow the story as it's mostly ""go there, bring this, do that."" The combat is alright but mostly annoying, especially when you get hit from all directions and the shoulder cam gives you nausea.. This is one of the best games I ever played.I really liked the story and gameplay.. Very Nice Game, with very interesting plot and action and stunning sceneries. What should I say? Great characters, awesome boss fights, breathtaking story. If you like having fun - play it!. The games fırst 3-4 hours is amazıng but after that playıng all game with axe is very boring it has good graphichs an nice story and solving puzzles is absloutly boring. It very boored and story is acceptable and compat is the best thing with the bosss. Stellar in every aspect. I adore everything about this game and am so shocked it took me this long to get around to playing it. Deserves every award it ever got!. A great game objectively better than Ragnarok(but subjectively I prefer Ragnarok) The only real flaw with it, though is the length and the enemys getting repetitive but other than that nine out of 10 game. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fantastic combat and feel. Amazing story with interesting characters. Excited to see what happens next. Lackluster and boring gear system.. As a 50 year old veteran gamer who had played and thoroughly enjoyed the PS2 iterations of God Of War, I was looking forward to finally playing this **** I have to say it was a fantastic experience. It's not without its faults though and there are some strange design decisions.....almost as if this game had 2 designers who never spoke to one another and then added stuff together in the final edit. Let me explain. You spend the game waiting to visit several areas of the map which are not available .....then the game ends and the areas are then only allowed to be visited. During the story the map is merely a help as locating things , not being able to visit them. The game is wonderfully weighted, the later combat is incredibly satisfying and fans of the old God of War moves will be more than happy with the fights on offer. The fights with Baldur are superb. Travelling with Atreas is excellent and he becomes a brilliant aid in difficult battles ,and when levelled up he is highly dangerous and unbeatable. His progress is well **** goes from weak child, to confidence, to an overconfident God and then ends up just like his father.....a powerful killing machine. The ageing of Kratos is a good decision by the developers and he looks much older than in his ps2 days. It felt wierd to finish the story and have so much left. I know that this happens in open world games, but it felt like a poor design choice. The story should have been the linear focus. Overall it's a 8.7 / 10 from **** I look forward to having a look around the world every now and then.. This was a great shake up to the franchise and a fresh take on the combat system and character development of Kratos. The Greek games were fun. But this one add more than just single minded Kratos only seeking vengeance. The new way the combat works and level up was a great touch too. Visuals are amazing as well.. A very good game, an introduction to the new world and Kratos' new life, it presents us with details and many things that will be answered in the future, it's fantastic to play this game again.. God of War (2018) is a stunning reinvention of the series, blending epic action with emotional depth. Kratos' journey with his son Atreus is both heartfelt and compelling, while the strategic combat and immersive world design elevate the experience. With breathtaking visuals, a powerful soundtrack, and an engaging story, it’s one of the best action-adventure games ever made. A must-play.. Great story and great fight dynamics. One of the most visually satisfying games that I played till now. The emotional connections between Kratos and Atreus is nicely portrayed and a great depth to the gameplay.. Camera angle is incredibly stupid. I hope they didn't forget that they were making a video game. Because this doesn't feel like a video game to me. It feels like they made the cutscenes first then made a video game to fit those scenes in, and of course with super dull level designs and abnoxious **** puzzles. When playing this game, I'm always wondering why am I playing Kratos but not Lara Croft. Why this literal god can't jump across a bridge without doing some **** puzzles. Also, having a child following you through the entire action game is one of the stupidest idea ever. As much as I like the character, can you imagine having child Ciri following Geralt throughout the entire game of Witcher 3? This is an action adventure game, not a family sitcom.. You should play this game at least once. It tells a compelling story and really shows off how the videogame medium can almost be a direct substitute for a modern movie or book. The combat feels perfectly weighted- especially chucking a big ice axe into some dude's head and then ripping it off said guy is VERY satisfying. It's perfectly violent but also wholesomely family friendly, an odd mix but it meshes well with the theme of the story. An epic tale! You should experience it.. The best god of war reboot anyone can ask for. The story and combat felt griddy and satisfying. one of the best story games i have ever played so glad i got to try it and what a story hats off for cory barlog. An absolute mastercraft in storytelling and gameplay. A huge step from GOW of old but it pays off and provides one of the best gaming experiences ever made. Start to finish its a true journey.. Amazing reboot of an established series. Everything about this game is different, and better, than the previous God of War games. The world, combat, music, and story are all engrossing and fun to experience. Complete playthrough of the game excluding grind took me only 31,5 hours on the highest difficulty (not GOD OF WAR). It only lasted 3 weeks in the real world, so the game definitely pulled me in. Story - 9/10 Without spoilers. The plot, to be honest, moved very fast, I sometimes even wanted to stop collecting resources just to find out what was next. World - 10/10 The world is amazing, filled with a lot of different interesting things that you want to explore. Especially in this respect the game is greatly enhanced by Mimir as a companion, his stories and narratives are perfect. Combat - 7/10 The combat system and its development is quite non-linear, and cool combos can be twisted as you please. And considering that weapons and armor are upgraded as you progress through the story, you don't even have to worry about it, the main thing is to loot a couple of chests with steel around the corner. Post story - 3/10 After the main plot I was left with the worlds of Muspelheim and Niflheim, Valkyries, collectibles, and Odin's ravens to trek through. Muspelheim given that one of the Valkyries is there, I closed it out with a bang. Though some of the challenges are overly long, but overall not bad for a trained player as a final overall challenge. The Valkyries are very good, they are as varied as they can be, with their own victory schemes that end up revealing an interesting part of the history of the world. Niflheim is worth visiting just for the Valkyries, otherwise just grind material for nothing (armor, not much there considering I was almost through the game at that point). Odin's Ravens and collectibles are only for those who do not regret their time.. 9.1/10. The story is fantastic if you look past the occasional, slightly awkward dialogue. Combat feels so freaking powerful and the controls are extremely intuitive while also providing plenty of different moves to keep it from getting repetitive.. GOOD PARTIES -Great visuals and performance. -The journey never gets boring with well-written characters. -The feeling of hitting in battles is very nice. -The battles are diverse and fast-paced. -The map and side quests are very high quality. -The level designs of the main quest and side quests are very good. -You feel the atmosphere with the music. -The cinematography is great. BAD PARTIES -There is very little enemy variety for this game length. -There are very few boss fights in the main quest. According to 2024. I love the re-invention of this franchise. Gone from Greece to Norse and a whole new depiction of Kratos, a more mature and stoic version. As much as I am a fan of the originals this is definitely a great change to keep the franchise alive and fresh.. this game is absolutely perfect, by kratos theaching atreus how to make the right choices, a revolutionary combat, and very good bossfights. the stranger is asbsolutely fantastic, and the witch relationship with kratos is amazing. no mistakes in this game.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. One if the beast games ever made the combat is fun and satisfying I would recommend for people and acting is top level. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Am I missing something? Great acting, really good art direction but repetitive clunky gameplay that get tedious quickly. The combat just isn’t satisfying. There isn’t a lock-on feature when battling, so you’re awkwardly repositioning yourself. On top of that, the animations aren't contextual, so if you start a combo and the enemy moves, you’ll continue the animation of Kratos swinging at empty space.. Kratos is old but but..................................................... Atreus is. Great narrative journey, only let down (slightly) by some padding sections and some dull sections from the boy.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. God of War, and it’s not just a game It's a whole experience The combat feels heavy and satisfying, especially with the Leviathan Axe. Hello, in my opinion, God of War 4 is much better than God of War Ragnarok, but there is a reason. Because Kratos in God of War Ragnarok is much weaker than 4 and there are other reasons that I can tell you from the point of view of the gameplay, which is quite clear that God of War 4 has shown better performance because in Ragnarok we are more in the snow and in forest environments. We are not and..... there are many other reasons that do not fit here. thank you. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. This is the start of a new era and new mythology called Norse mythology which imo isn't as good nor as well executed as the old games. The story here has its moments to shine but also has a whiny Atreus. Atreus is the weakest link to the story here and honestly I didn't care for him here. I get their intentions but it comes across as uncharismatic and destroys what made God Of War so likable in the first place. It's still a good game tho and is a visual masterpiece. Just the story could've been handled better.. God of War very effectively achieves its mission to be a good reboot of the saga and a good sequel. Each one of the days of the five years of development of this new delivery is evident in the great values of production in each one of the sections, materializing perfectly in the constant sequence plane.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. **** not open world. But God of War never was... it gives you a slight idea of an open world, but its not completely.. i dont care.. i loved the story tellings and the myths behind this game. very good set pieces,and very good dialogues. i love fighting with this god. for me, its a must play... [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. God of War is another excellent game in the iconic franchise, Kratos battles in a whole new world, with new mythology, creating an epic sequel. God of War: Ragnarök is a flawless sequel with even greater depth, exquisite realms, and polished battle. With customisable difficulty, the game can be experienced by players of all skill levels and introduces combat with a brief but clear tutorial if required. Once mastered, combat becomes continually enticing and the bosses each have their own style of combat, meaning there is never a dull fight. Furthermore, with the many different armour types, the game can be customised to each individual player's game-style, whether they favour runic attacks, strength or otherwise. The Valkyries are particularly interesting and difficult bosses that you can battle throughout the game, making a terrific addition for those who enjoy the combat. For what you pay, the game delivers above and beyond, the graphics in this game are phenomenal, incredibly detailed characters and backgrounds, with smooth playthrough. The detail and work put into each realm is phenomenal, with such a vast variety of places to explore, the developers have not visually disappointed. The character design is incredibly detailed and complex, making it infinitely pleasing to look at. However, it is not just the main characters that receive a complex look, all enemies and side characters have a unique and detailed design that is wonderful to experience. Immense amounts of effort have been put into all character design, with backstories, clever quips, and personalised one-liners. Intricate details like this, go a long way into making a game feel finished and in depth. Furthermore, you will easily get your money's worth in playthrough time: with not only the main story, but many other possible quests, the game will keep you entertained for easily 30 hours+. With so many extra, option items to collect and bosses to fight, the game keeps giving, ensuring you receive what you have paid for. For only $14.99 (or £11.32) the game certainly exceeds the expectation with its polished graphics and gameplay. Throughout the game, the player is accompanied by perfectly chosen music. It is phenomenal. The soundtrack for this game is truly ethereal, the music creates moments of unbreakable tension and boundless beauty. It aligns with the storytelling perfectly, adding the perfect amount of drama to the overall atmosphere of the game. Speaking of which, the atmosphere of the game is rarely broken with the seamless gameplay, cut scenes flow effortlessly into combat and vice versa. Furthermore, prior knowledge of the game and previous games in this series are not essential, making God of War available to everyone, no matter their experience. Overall, God of War has been perfectly crafted as a sequel to the original set of games, cleverly made to be accessible to any fresh players, while retaining precious lore, plot, and overall vibe from previous games. It is highly recommended to play God of War, as it offers such a wonderful experience.. A triumph in updating a flawed legacy character to a more modern sensibility. The combat is deliberate and punishing, with just the right amount of RPG/customization elements. The acting is tremendous. The environments are gorgeous and feel like a storybook come to life, further enhancing the rich story of fatherhood and forgiveness. This is a must-play.. they ruined the god of war, what a shame,what is the last of us camera doing in god of war?. Overall, this game is a great game for players who want a lot of action. The lore has it’s own references to mythologies and the addition of Kratos blends well with it. There is a lot of things to do in the game and a story that is a must play for any RPG lovers out there and also with the fans of the franchise.. New life of the best game series. One of the few continued in the games that surpassed the previous parts. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. A great game and a different but still violent Kratos. The story is really great and the combat too. Really perfect work on graphics, a beautifull open wolrd with plenty of places to explore. Great job on voices. Epic music. Perfect. ONE OF THE BEST GAMES IN THE ENTIRE WORLD,i gotta tip My hat to Santa Monica team,The graphics,The story,The combat,The character development,just a masterpiece, highly recommend. I just can say that I love, its a beautiful game, that combines a good story and amazing mechanics.. One of the best games ever made, İt has best combat mechanics, İncredible villain, Amazing boss fights, and a great story but open world is kinda small but its still good. God of War is the perfect example of how to make a video game memorable. While we were already familiar with the character of Kratos, God of War 2018 reinvents itself and captivates both fans and new players with every aspect of this magnificent game. Gameplay, characters, music, and story—all the elements that make up God of War are simply iconic and excellent.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. God of war 2018 is a game that takes you to an adventure you went never before...A must buy for all PS5/PC users after the latest Graphics patch it looks amazing.. It is a thrilling adventure with a compelling story. Despite the challenging gameplay, GOW kept me hooked with its engaging narrative and beautiful world.. The combat scenes are incredibly spectacular, and executing regular enemies and bosses feels amazing. However, it's a pity that the QTE (Quick Time Event) mechanics were removed, and the regular enemies and bosses are too repetitive.. Stunning gorgeous visuals, really intuitive and rich game play, superb dialogues, great storyline, lovingly memorable characters. It is almost the perfect video game. The only (mild) shortcomings: the maps are practically useless and the soundtrack is bland.. Probably one of the best video journeys I’ve ever seen.There’s beautiful ALL, visual, music, characters,gameplay in general. Highly recommend. Amazing gameplay. Great new story, they linked it with the old games in a terrific way. Loved it. A must play game.. The story's just the tip of the iceberg for Norse mythology (the sequel's probably gonna throw down with Odin, 'cause they took out his kid), but the pacing and the visuals are spot on. Combat's tight and the game's no joke; one wrong move and you're done for.. This is the most beatifull game and i love this beacause the combat is so god. The history is beatifull. Kratos is the best protagonist in the games. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Incredible game!

This requires additional resources that universities can hardly afford. Universities have to cut their belts thinner because the state subsidy is getting slimmer by the year and student debt is enormous. With each start of the academic year, there are reports of prospective students who are left without food or accommodation because their expectations of the NSFAS are misplaced or insufficiently communicated. Universities have to sacrifice academic and operational activities again and again to cope with student anger. The importance of the aid scheme also extends further into the economy. Entrepreneurs have created extra student accommodation, only to find out that rental rates are limited and they will consequently suffer unforeseen losses. At the same time, there are non-accredited providers of accommodation who worm their way into the market to profit illegally. Shops that rely on the sale of prescribed books have had to close their doors due to a change in the payment of student grants. Then there are the beneficiaries who can legitimately claim that their needs are not properly accounted for. Instead of concentrating on their studies, students now have to devote time and attention to the non-payment or late payment of grants. Some are really exposed to hardship. Nzimande followed with his statement the dismissal of the NSFAS board claims the entity has ""various challenges to its processes, IT systems, capacity, policies and controls"". On the face of it, it is an admission that the wrong and incompetent people have been appointed to the board and executive positions. They are not able to manage a complex's system efficiently and are apparently acting in their own interest. When officials move into a luxury office building in the Cape Town city centre, pay millions a month for it and some of the councilors deal generously with our tax money, this should be a source of serious concern to us. According to an investigation by the Organization against Tax Abuse (Outa), Nzimande's hands, also chairman of the SACP, are apparently not clean either. The current crisis is just one of many in the higher education environment, and the minister does not inspire any confidence. The theory of the NSFAS as a multiplier of opportunities and progress in our society testifies to a noble objective that is undermined by shameless greed, inept management and short-sighted oversight. Willemse is an emeritus professor in literature and theory at the University of Pretoria. How to move forward with West? Kobus Terblanche, Middelburg Koos Malan's article ""a Battle for the heart of the West deem worthy instead of just different from us. Without. This game is another example of how you should make a game, I’m currently in the middle of play the sequel ragnorok that’s how good this is, I bought ragnorok 2 days after completing this! It’s story is very good at keeping you to speed and giving new information at the same time, the graphics is top tier and the open world aspects of this are some of the best in gaming. The one thing I can say is I wish they was more realms in this instalment. Sony are incredible for story games and it shows! 10/10. i think this game is OVERRATED but also the story and characters really make the game a story to remember and even if I think this game isn't as good as everyone else it is still a staple in gaming that someone should at least try once. since my expectation is so high for the best franchise of sony ever, I was sceptic to hit 8 instead of 9. Amazing graphics, a bold change for a hack and slash game. the game is now played at a lower pace (apart from boss fights) and this may be a deal breaker for some adrenalin junkies. overall, decend experience, and high level of quality is wide spread across the game by all means. I love the father-child relationship touchpoint. decent story telling. if the title was not GOW, it would be an 8 to be honest.. This game has an amazing story and world. The writers and level designers brought their A+ skills to the game and it is a gem on these points. Where this game lost all its points is with its mechanics and its combat. The combat feels clunky and unsatisfying, enemies are just hit sponges and the dodge/parry mechanics are probably the worst ones I've seen in a somewhat recent game. The ""harder"" fights are simply made impossible if you are under-leveled and too easy if you have the appropriate level, even on hard difficulty. It looks like this game can't decide in feeling like a power fantasy or a challenging game so it just ends up failing at both. It was an excellent reboot for the series, introducing a new mythology with an engaging plot and a villain worthy of it. However, it still doesn’t measure up to the original PlayStation 2 trilogy.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. ONE OF THE BEST SINGLE-PLAYER STORY GAMES OF ALL TIME! Go play it right now and you can thank me later! (Unless you didn't like it in which case... why?). Pros - one of the best feeling combat systems - stellar acting and voice work - solid amount of post game content - genuinely fun on harder difficulties // Cons - lack of an ability to jump makes exploration annoying - some skill upgrades can screw you over like Countering Blast - some enemies (read Dark Elves) are beyond frustrating to fight // God of War is a beautifully realized game with a simple yet fun combat system that feels perfect. Add to that the stellar throw and return mechanic on the Leviathan axe and you have a genuinely fantastic combat. When it comes to fighting, God of War will grab you from the very first encounter and carry you to the end with a surprising amount of visceral grace. Kratos feels weighty. Every move he implements is savagely visceral and just feels right to perform. The solid variety of Runic arts only adds to that. Then there is the story. Surprisingly, a game with such a solid combat base is not slacking in this aspect either. Everybody does a fantastic job and everybody within the game just feels so natural. I never doubted anyone saying anything. Couple of gripes would be the out of combat movement and some of the regular skills. The lack of a jump button really limits the game's potential for fun exploration. Then there are the skills, especially Countering Blast. Looks cool, not expensive but if it is multiple projectiles coming right at you, you will most likely parry the first projectile and then get stuck in the return animation as you get pelted by the rest of the attacks. Overall God of War is a beautiful game that I could only recommend.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Fantastic Story, Grahpic and Gameplay. A really great experience. Must play! The son is a bit annoying, but that makes it real ; ). [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I know a lot of people hasn't like the results of goat 2018. But I can see, gow deserved it too. This game is amazing.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. whoever put all the puzzles in the game should get fired but everything else was good. As in every God of War, the feeling of hitting is great. We are in Scandinavia now!. tbh nothing special boring gameplay only story is something good. there is nothing scpecial. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The story was insanely good, i almost want a movie now. The gameplay, was fantastic, everything i could have wanted out **** game. New enough to spark an intrest, and similar enough to be nostalgic. It's an overrated game. Pros: nice graphics for that year, nice combat mechanics, nice story. Cons: Enemy variety is extremely low, bosses are exactly the same, puzzles are also exactly the same. It's a fun but definitely overrated.. SCORE: WEAK 9 = 9,0 Very good story, i liked the characters in this game, the combat system is very good, the world they created is also very beautiful. The lore they made in this game is also one of the strong points in this game. And very fun endgame content after the mainstory. The game overall feels really polished and satisfying to play.. Really good game with an amazing story combat can be a bit annoying at times and the puzzles are very tedious but overall amazing game. My first time with the God of War franchise and I really enjoyed it. It is not my all time favorite game but one cannot deny the ENORMOUS amount of passion that went into this reboot of the franchise. Combat is excellent and the story was very much well done, emotional and with twists.. i give 9 because gameplay is just perfect story is perfect ı love everything about this game but just sometimes its being very boring ı want fight but game say puzzle puzzle do you want some puzzle more puzzle ı dont like that. what can i say about this masterpiece **** believe there's still hopein gaming really just perfect. I didn’t expect the game to be THIS good. The gameplay, story, just everything is perfect. I tried hard to like this game, but i always got bored after the good start it had. Might be because i didn't play the old god of war story, but the story just didn't seem that interesting to me.... God of War: A captivating journey, the best combat system I have ever experienced, and an unbelievable amount of polish As a PC-Gamer, I came to the God of War-Franchise with a serious drawback: I had never played Kratos’ earlier adventures. I knew by cultural osmosis that I was tugging on the strings of a man who had murdered an entire pantheon, but I had not seen. That God of War still made me feel the soul-crushing weight of this unseen past, and Kratos’ anxiety about this past somehow infecting his son shows how superbly strong the writing and the performances on display are. The script is not the only aspect of this game soaring to such sterling levels of quality. From the very first scene, the art on display is dazzling. Majestic mountains crowned with eternal snow, winter-kissed woods, every environment is both unbelievably realistic and infused with fantastic, epic exaggeration, creating a land infused with magic. Kratos is a giant of a man, every muscle ever discovered chiseled to perfection, yet the play of emotions on his face is always perfectly relatable, as is everybody else’s. And the animations! Combat feels kinetic and weighty, yet blindingly fast at times, out of combat every step taken, every climb looks and feels real. I mean, I’ve missed the quiet confidence with which Kratos beaches his rowboat when playing other games, for crying out loud. The soundscape is just as stellar: Effects are distinct, clear and punchy, the score plays on the player’s emotions in the background at one time only to sweep him up in epic swells the next, and the voice cast sells every line on the page and every emotion in the margins as if their life depended on it. The script is, what lets them do that and I have already spoiled my opinion, yet let me reiterate: It’s wonderful. The game is essentially a road trip of a father and his estranged son with pretty much all the associated trope","i completed it in about a week and did not regret a single minute spent in this game . took god of war to the next level with amazing graphics, story, musi, gameplay and difficulty . i found it boring and tedious. Looks good but it's not at all compelling ."
520.Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30,"Brothers in Arms brings players a griping narrative, with addicting squad-based gameplay.. During a time when shooters hadn't really made their mark yet, this game came, this game saw. Although compared to other games it's not as exciting, it' simple in it's own good way.. Bloody, crude, harsh and very violent, maybe it wasnt the CoD of last generation but if it was the big jugaloo ,then maybe it could had been famous by the awesome campaign. I enjoyed every single bullet I shot to my enemies .","compared to other games it's not as exciting, but it's simple in it's own good way . compared to other games it's not as exciting, but it's simple in it's own good way ."
521.Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut,"Great first-person action RPG game. Good futuristic and cyberpunk setting. A little gem available on the Nintendo console, which in this version makes good use of the dual screen.. Great game and the Director's Cut is a good improvement, if the cities could have maintained the feeling of a huge and pretty open world over the whole playtime it would nearly be perfect.. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a fun stealth game and provides amazing deep in how one can enjoy its experience in gameplay. You find many ways to take out enemies and navigate your way from point a to point b. While the story may be boring at times and majority of bosses can be a major let down, its does have its golden moments. Adam Jenson must find something close to him so that he may piece together the fallen pieces of his life. In a world where people are dealing with their most serve problems through augmentation, its seems not enough to satisfy Adams wises, he must look deeper, for mystery surrounds his every thought. Who do you trust now to help you find the way and stay on course? How can one survive? The gameplay is a bunch of fun, but while its the strongest point of the game, its also its draw back. I always find myself being taken out of the gameplay when im wanting more of it. The stealth is so engaging and deep, it makes me want to spend most of my time having fun with it. But with all the loading, story bits, reading notes, hacking devices, it just bums your experience a little too much. But when you get in that stealth mode, boy is it fun. I enjoyed playing with the different augmentations a little, but mainly i didnt full with them much, i just enjoyed the freedom of moving a round and taking out guys in so many different ways. The weapons gameplay is also very nice and diverse, the only weapon i didnt care for too much was the sniper guns, didnt find the aiming to be all that accurate without a cross eye to target people, so was kinda a guessing matter for a so called pro, made me feel under powered. Pistol was my favorite gun, was cool having it to take out cameras when needed and shot other random objects. The story i didnt care for too much, characters were not all that engaging, and most except for Jenson were pretty boring and had no character build up, i didnt care much for any of them as i knew nothing about them and they seem to just be random dudes helping me out in my quest. The ending was very cool and rewarding though, i did enjoy that part. Bosses were somewhat a let down majority of the time, two boss fights were very cool and one i loved to death, but the other 3 were very easy and pretty boring. One i dont even think was a boss it was so easy, i just one-shotted him. Gameplay was still solid though and game was very polished. I had a great time with Dues Ex, the stealth was amazing and would love to have a game that focused on that part of the gameplay without all the other interferences. I would consider the game to be a very good game, but nothing too special for me, would highly recommend to people who enjoy stealth games or just action games with strategy in general.. I don't get why people who own a WiiU are so dumb this is THE best port for the system the best fps rpg game and still it hasn't got enough sells!! It took me almost 2 yrs to find this game and like most of my Wii U games it is a hidden germ. Deus Ex is a great game which unfortunately is now showing its age released on the WiiU. I was surprised to find that the graphics are inferior to the xbox360 version, which I spent a lot of time playing. The gamepad is used to good effect and genuinely addes to the experience. For me the best aspect of the WiiU version (and the best part of the WiiU in general) is the fact that it offers off-tv play.. Stunning game with story as good as gameplay. It is on the same level of quality as Dishonored, which to me means that both are just phenomenal games that any gamer should play through in their entirety.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I will admit, this game is not perfect, but it is damn close to being so. As someone who played the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution on PS3, the new additions and changes made to the game just make it a much better experience. After the first boss in the base Human Revolution, I was blown over by the sudden switch to full-on combat when I was playing a stealth game. Director's Cut mitigates this by adding stealth and ranged options to the boss fights, making the game much more streamlined. Porting the game to the Wii U was one of the best ideas. The inventive use of the Wii U GamePad makes the game just that little bit more interesting, especially the hacking mechanic, which can now be performed much more quickly with the touch screen. The only criticism I have is the choice to show the sniper reticle on the GamePad, which can sometimes be slightly awkward to use. The game also has some minor framerate issues in the opening movies, however but for its flaws, Director's Cut is a fantastic update to the brilliant game that was Deus Ex: Human Revolution.. Looks pretty, but its kinda difficult to appreciate that when the controls are horrendous! Very close to being unplayable. Do yourself a favor a buy it for the pc. Just another **** for nintendo to desperatly make some money of wii u witch swansong is already playing loud.. This game is outstanding, the graphical style is fantastic to look at and you will often find yourself looking at the views when you are in tall buildings. The gameplay is some of the best I have played in this genre and the augmentations (character upgrades) really change the way that you play the game and approach different situations of which there are many options. The storyline is very compelling and has some real life undertones to it. The sound is also very good and suits the sci-fi nature of the game well. There are many weapons in the game which are all really fun to use and can be upgraded too with things like explosive bullets and laser sights etc. The hacking mini game is also one of the best ones I have seen in a game and is really satisfying to unlock areas and find goodies inside. The wii u game pad also makes the hacking more fun and adds new elements to the game. The ability to hack robots and turrets to turn them against your enemies is also super fun. I would strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes sci-fi shooters/stealth games because this is one of the best ones around and the wii u version is the best version because of the added game pad functionality.. Buying a wii u, I wasn't THAT impressed by the sound and design, but my all time fav- Pikmin 3 was beautiful. Now, Deus Ex Human Evolution- my fav game on pc is on wii u! I picked it up- a little pricy but brat altogether. IAM NOT KIDDING THIS GAME IS SO EPIC. the graphics are epic, the sound acting is awesome. The physics are brilliant. Must Buy dudes. Must buy.. The definitive version **** game. The director's cut on Wii U features improved boss fights, awesome gamepad functionality (hacking on the gamepad is so much better), the missing link DLC and greatly improved visuals. However, the game still feels a bit old I think the stealth mechanics in newer games like Splinter Cell have spoiled me a bit as the mechanics here feel clunky in comparison. Still the upgrade system is great and it is really fun to try scenarios from various different approaches to see which works best. Definitely recommended to ppl who haven't played it before but not much new for ppl who have. Still, it's the best version of the game and it is worthy of your time if you are planning on playing it through once more.. The game play overall was average. There was nothing new there. The IA was ridiculously stupid and horribly programmed, an example of this was when I threw a cardboard box at a team mate and they shot me. This game is not worth your money and you should avoid it.. Players will get to relive Adam Jensen's saga in a whole new way. Expanding on the already critically acclaimed game, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, the Director's Cut introduces superb second-screen support, reworked boss battles, improved assets and seamless integration of the Missing Link DLC within the main story. Deus Ex: HR itself has an already wonderfully built world complete with a plethora of characters and deep mysteries to them. What the studio has done is truly Deus Ex compared to other modern re-imaginings have done to classic franchises. This game is truly a ""modern classic"" in my opinion and what this re-release does is improve upon that perfection.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]","deus ex: human revolution is a fun stealth game and provides amazing deep in how one can enjoy its experience in gameplay . while the story may be boring at times, its does have its golden moments . i always find myself being taken out of the gameplay when im wanting more of it ."
522.Tetris Effect: Connected,"Great game with incredible graphics. Doesn't matter if you like the classic Tetris or you are up to new challenges, play if you have the chance to!. It's the best tetris game... but it's just tetris so idk what else to say. Hope this helps. Both intense and relaxing, depending on the level. Neat graphics while staying true to the concept. Very short though.. A phantasmagoria of cascading colours and sounds. Truly something special.. No spoiler needed as it's Tetris, but with fancy features/presentation and refined mechanics. But some of the petpeeves for me is the tile color trends to clash with the background, making it somewhat impossible to tell on the drops and shapes. There are loads of challenges, a mix of old and new modes which I dare say it's like a definitive edition but not enough as some popular features that professional Tetris players need isn't in it. Online play only has two, co-op and versus mode which are good but not that great as there aren't enough players to go by. This would benefit the most if it had Tetris 99 mode which is hectic and fun but this Tetris only focus on being in the calm mode. Replayability, well, again, it's Tetris. Unlimited replayability. As much as I would recommend this game on the Xbox, I'd push someone to get the PS4 version mainly due to the inclusion of VR for immersion and it's most complete game.. This game looks incredible, runs incredible and the music being played to when you put down a piece down is incredible. Gets a bit repetitive though.. It is a game that can be played from time to time when you get bored of long-term games. It brought Tetris back into our lives with beautiful musics and smooth game play.. Fantastic Game you know what to expect going in you will receive a triple A version of that with an added layer of flair and modernism enhancing the game while it retains its roots. I've played solo, coop, and story mode. Playing these modes on both pc and Xbox series x through the eligibility of game pass allowing me to use cross play to include my wife into coop mode. We both enjoyed the fun and the simplicity of it basically being local coop. With my controller Bluetoothed to my pc I proceeded to the living room couch and joined her as I mashed the A button to revive over and over helping the real star of the show beat the AI. She carried me through multiple rounds as I died n revived at ambiguous times and continued the game just long enough for her to return and obliterate the formidable AI. While the Computer coop partner was all but useless the AI who deemed her a worthy opponent truly fought with might inspiring fear into my heart. Luckily my wife has a very logical and intense brain that rivaled our foe in every form of the game. Out performing this AI to me was miraculous seeing as I'm so good at halo and metal gear solid and gaming in general. Here comes this novice phone game player who enjoys mostly rts games and she killed it with logics. For me this game is fun but difficult for her and the right type of player its an OCD conquest of epic proportions begging to be completed quickly by sheer will and intelligence. I recommend this game to all with a logical brain, the desire to complete, to be graded, and to do better and let it be shown via in game leaderboards. My wife truly outshines me in this game and in life.. Who knew Tetris could still blow people away in 2021. Honestly, this isn't just Tetris, this is a combination of Tetris, meditation, music and a really tough challenge.. Tetris Effect: Connected is a masterpiece and one of the best in the Tetris Series. With very good single player modes and great multiplayer modes. It's a easy recommendation to everyone.. It is simply incredible how a tetris game can be so entretaining. 100% recommended. Unplayable **** Its more like effects with some tiny tetris somewhere behind all the disco **** that cant be turned off. Might be good to get high, enjoy the lights but good **** luck actually playing it.. It's tetris! Nice effects, great multiplayer. Some nice new modes. Especially the boss mode is great and motivating. Sadly the AI is not the best in the connected mode... The game has some really good music that is influenced by your controls. That is really nice, unfurtunately the local multiplayer has the same music over and over. It would be great to change the songs to get more variety.. The best version of Tetris there is now, after playing PuyoPuyo Tetris for years. Absolutely love the Classic Attack online, made it into the Top 1%, such a fun experience.. It's tetris... yep, but this is a great evolution for the most classic game ever. Modern graphics, nice levels and game modes, outstanding soundtrack and of course Gamepass make this one of the best tetris games ever made.. I didn't expert too much initially as I did try it because he was part of game pass. Finally I liked the graphics and the music, it was nice to play again tetris. Will certainly play it time to time now.. The definitive Tetris experience. Already in PS4 it was amazing, a 9.5 game. But with the multiplayer it reached the perfect score. Who would have thought a Tetris game could be this good.. When my Series X arrived I started this game just because I was waiting for my AC:V download to finish. I ended up playing Tetris for 4 hours straight and had so much fun. The gameplay is highly addictive, the sounds and music supporting every action you make make it so much more intense. I must admit, I did not expect this. When I heard about a Tetris game I thought ""ok, let's try it, I mean it's Tetris, should be fun for half an hour or so"". But this game takes the Tetris formula, adds a ton of LSD to it and delivers endless hours of fun.. UPDATE - So I have left my initial impressions intact below, this morning Saturday 14th of November 2020 the game has been updated over night and fixed the issues I was having, so I have changed my score accordingly. It is a great game — Original post below — Xbox Series X - not as optimised as advertised. I have cleared each of the levels in this game multiple times on PS4 Pro, it is great so I was looking forward to jumping in on the new series x, and earning some achievements and the enjoying the challenge. There is a big unfortunately coming... The performance of the game is pretty poor, with noticeable slow down and input lag, occasionally even crashing to the Home Screen. I have tried to record the game but Microsoft’s limit of screen capture to only 15 seconds, and also crashing anytime I try to upload the captured poor performance is just another issue. The game looks gorgeous, the music is catchy and mesmerising, I hope for a patch to come through and fix these issues, because at the moment playing at the higher levels of difficulty are exercises in absolute frustration. I loaded up the game on PS4 Pro and then the PS5 in backwards compatible mode and had no issues, so it’s specific to the Series X and the Connected version of the game","it's the best tetris game... but it's just tetris so idk what else to say . it's a game that can be played from time to time when you get bored of long-term games . it looks incredible, runs incredible and the music being played to when you put down a piece is incredible ."
523.Dishonored,"Top 10 all times game, absolutely must play, what can i say more to reach 75 characters?. Dishonored allows you to approach it the way you want to approach it. Leaving you feeling like you have so much control. All packaged in a stunning looking game, with an interesting universe.. One of the best stealth action games ever made. Some parts are a bit too easy these days, but it's still a very good game.. Perfect just over all perfect from the story to the gameplay it's just amazing the stealth is the best in the whole entirety of Gaming I love this game with all my heart LsakaL - 21/10/24. The gameplay, artstyle, combat, powers are all perfect. The gameplay is really what your playing the game for, the story very much takes a backseat which works in its favour.. A highlight of the immersive sim sub-genre. Fascinating alternate-reality world and culture, rich and engaging combat possibilities. An absolute blast.. Dishonored was one of the best immersive sims of its time, and it established Arkane as a studio to follow. It drew influences from games like Bioshock, Thief and Deus-Ex, as well as the best stealth games to create an experience that, although narratively quite weak (reading documents is a pain), ends up being quite satisfying to play.. It's a top game for sure , had tons of funs with it. Finish it multiple time and the game mechinc are super awsome. i loved the gameplay, story, the characters, the chaos system and the setting, dunwall is beautiful and the graphics seem like an oil painting. p.s. SAMUEL YOU ARE THE BEST CHARACTER EVER. Perfect stealth game with a great story. The steam punk worth is great. Couldn't stop playing.. Short game but really good.....hdgdg hyge iuiwo hcugioe weeaqw dew hshtgr rg. The best game i ever played its very nice at combat andyou can choice thinks in gamei love tish game and i rate it 10. So many ways to try out things! And some of the missions are really clever. Perhaps less organic than Thief 2, due to context sensitive controls, but in every other way a better game.. what do i have to say this game is amazing but I'll go into further detail the story, powers, and characters are great this is also not like your normal stealth game where you would have to wait for a guard to move when you could use your powers to move right past him or behind him to take him out also the level design is great and the combat i like also how runes and bone charms are just collectibles and not required and if you collect them they can give enhancements to your character and i like the way that the shop works as well. This game has perfect atmosphere. Characters were perfect in this. I like the endings changes if you kill all people or you kill no one. And the option to compete the game without killing is very good option.. I had high expectations after finishing DeathLoop. but this game is MUCH better. It's a good game, but it seems they decided to lean into stealth a bit later during development.. no third person perspective. Even elder scroll has third person pespective. Astonishing in a STEALTH game.. What first seems like a standard action adventure game, Dishonored takes the bold move of encouraging you to play it smart and to use your environment and abilities to their fullest extent. Blink is one of the best mechanics ever introduced to a video game, and let's your character become a mobility demon who can maneuver his way out of just about any scenario. Pacifist and Violence are both incredible fun and you can synergize their respective abilities incredibly well. Short and sweet with multiple endings, a must play that hold up better than most games in its genre.. Attractive looking stealth-based FPS set in a steampunk alternate reality that plays like a cross between Bioshock and Assassin's Creed. Not as atmospheric as the undersea realm of Rapture but with lots of side challenges and a storyline that changes depending on your tactics, there's plenty of replay value.. Superb stealth action game with an unforgettable setting and incredibly appropriate and flexible powers.. Dishonored shines in it's ability to do everything right in a way, that you want/need to play through it multiple times. The amount of different routes and ways there are to beat the levels is insane and the storyline that shifts depending on your playstyle is interesting and worth seeing the different outcomes. Both action and stealthy playstyles are very fun and the mechanics for both are very good. Love this absolute classic.. I've already covered that one of my favorite subgenres of video games are metroidvanias. Mostly, I love when games feel immersive. Shooters are fun, sure, but killing everything in your way until you get to the next cinematic bit is only thrilling for so long. Some third-person (and a few first-person) shooters have even implemented some platforming bits, puzzle bits and role-playing (RPG) elements to keep the gameplay fresh, but nothing compares to another favorite genre of mine, the immersive sim. What is an immersive sim? The antithesis to RPGs, which allows you to define who you are as a character, immersive sims have clearly defined characters with clearly defined motivations. It's how you play the game in which the distinction between the two is apparent. To put it simply, the developers provide you a playground, a target objective (most commonly killing someone or stealing something), and hundreds of tools to accomplish the objective in whichever manner you see fit. Stealthy? Perfectly fine. Guns blazing? Knock yourself out. The developers are even fine with you ignoring the target objective all together and coming up with something entirely different (like sparing a target's life). Dishonored, like immersive sims before it, drops you into world rich with history and story to be uncovered (or ignored) around every corner. From the start, I could see why the developers, Arkane Studios, have received so much praise. Every inch of this game feels worth exploring, like a mystery I must solve, from trying to find ancient runes tucked just out of reach, locked doors with only a keyhole teasing what might be inside and collectibles scattered everywhere. I constantly found myself distracted and wandering off the beaten path. Then there's the gameplay. It's so much fun zipping around the city using the ""blink"" (teleport) ability, finding high perches to plan my route or crawling through the rat-infestated tunnels to avoid enemy patrols ('cause frankly, I **** at combat). Plus, unlike other games, your decisions actually matter and the game reacts to how to play. Like to go in and kill everyone? Cool. The bad guys will start wearing thicker armor. Did you chose to off people instead of sparing them? Fine. The next playthrough will have double the enemies. Did you side with the one character instead of the other? Well, now there's an entire area of the city that's hostile towards you. Oh, and that blink ability I loved so much, now there were bad guys that hated me for exposing their magic to the world. Immersion is what makes a game fun. A game that asks you to feel more invested and responds to that investment gives the biggest payoff in the end. Plus, my playthrough was unique to me, and that feels special.. Arkane’s Masterpiece from the 360 Era Do not sleep on this game or it’s the definitive edition. I would argue that it is the second best stealth game ever made next to its sequel. This game is a masterpiece in terms of stealth, atmosphere, world building, moral choices, rpg elements, creativity in level design and combat, and so much more. Pick this game up asap. If you have game pass download and play the definitive edition.. This game needs so much patience. The story and voice acting seems to be good. But the gameplay is very basic, so boring that i almost only ran through the levels like rambo and meele killed the guards. Quest hub is designed badly, a conversation forced me to go to bed, only to find the way back like in a labyrinth, to the same position and with the same NPCs again, well thanks for this cutoff. Next mission took me into the sewers, where the exit was glitched and broke the immersion. Next mission took me back to the location where i already did a mission, this is calling recycling.. Dishonored was a very well done game with an intriguing story. It's the type of game you can go in guns blazing and use all your abilities as you level up, or you can just be sneaky in the shadows and attack from above.. No spoilers. Great story and great gameplay. I definitely recommend this to anyone that loves single player and story based games.. Perhaps I've played too many games, and genres of games but this game disappointed me. I certainly won't say it's a bad game but I just didn't find it all that fun. Mostly this is a stealth based game and after playing Shadow Tactics I would say that their top down camera angle by far is my preference for similar conceptual gameplay. I found the stealth in this game disjointed compared to that one. Similarly I found better shooting elements in other games. I also found better emotional story in other games I've played too and this game did little to make me feel immersed as Corvo. This game is a good blend of many genres and I do feel it is a decent game but from my perspective the sum of its parts kinda waters down what I like most about specific genres and in this hybrid game I really felt bland playing it.. Dishonored is probably my 2nd favourite game of all time (behind Dishonored 2 hehe). It’s a first person stealth-action game and an immersive sim set in a 19th century setting. What I loved about the series is how much freedom you get in choosing how to play the game. The levels are so ridiculously detailed letting you progress through them a million different ways (i.e. Go through the front door or scout the building exterior and look for a secret entrance or teleport to higher ground and go through an open window or even possess a freaking rat and crawl through the ventilation system). There was new things I learnt about each level even when playing them for the 3rd time. The stealth gameplay is as good as it gets because it has the best level design in all of gaming imo and it’s designed to facilitate the stealth gameplay (hiding spots, places to dump bodies, etc). The AI of the enemies is really good compared to most other stealth games because the guards can become hostile from seeing you very easily and from many angles; they aren’t **** like in many other stealth games, especially on higher difficulties. It also lets you complete the game non lethally and without ever getting detected. Not to mention it’s amazing combat system which lets you play the game as a full blown action game. Because of it, doing front up assaults on all enemies is as fun of a playstyle as playing stealthily and the powers/tool sets the game gives you make it a fully viable playstyle. You can also get really creative with the powers/tool sets the game gives you (check out StealthGamerBR’s Dishonored videos on Youtube). Whether you’ll enjoy stealth in first person depends on personal preference. You should note that it lets you lean to peak around corners and that the game gives you an ability very early on that lets you see enemies through walls if you’re worried about limited viewing angles in first person. For me, the first person perspective combined with the really unique atmosphere/art style made the game so immersive and nostalgic. I can fanboy over it all day but you probably won’t know if you’ll like it until you try it out because it’s such a unique game.. This game explodes my mind and is extremely good and a masterpiece in everything. Something refreshing and new with Corvo Attano as the protagonist, an implacable assassin that try to restore the order. Arkane Studios did a MUST HAVE MASTERPIECE.. This is without a doubt my favorite game of all time. The controls are great, the story is great, the campaign is great. Honestly this is a must-play by my standards.. A steampunk action-stealth game that blends ""Thief"" with ""Bioshock"". This is a standout title due its art style, level design and combat system. There are also some aspects that recall ""Assassin's Creed"" and ""The Darkness"". Overall, ""Dishonored"" is great fun. I would give it a 9 out of 10.. We have all established that Bethesda are well known for unique games that are worth playing. Dishonored is Bethesda's latest game at a new innovative game. And thankfully they have succeeded. Dishonored smart advertising and unique nature hooked us in the game so our expectations were high. The best feature of the game is the sort of Deus Ex feel to it in the means of gameplay. Each mission of the game is a sort of open land were you get to decide what tactics you will take. There are to main ways to play or stealthily or a more kill everyone approach. What is interesting is that there are many ways to play with either option. Interesting enough the outcome of the game drastically changes with each play style so multiple playthroughs are needed to experience the full package. The environments also change according to play style. if you kill everyone there will be more flies and rats than taking the stealth approach. Both play styles are fun but I prefer the stealth approach as I find that there are more options and spells suited for this play style. Another thing I adore about this game is the art syle. It is very interesting, it is cartoon like but is dark which makes the game have an edge. The graphics themselves are not that good but this does not detract from anything. The game is not hard, so not much skill is needed to beat it but it is very rewarding. A problem I found with the game is that the many ways to beat the game can allow you to skip specific areas way too easily but this is not much of a problem. The powers in the game are all very fun and most importantly very useful. These spells are so much fun to wield and as you will see you will use them a lot in the game. The sound in the game is also very good and with ok voice acting. A thing I did not like in the game is the story. The story I found is not that strong, the world is so dark and violent that I really expected to be blown away with the story and I got a very good solid story. Although some characters are really well written and they are really interesting. A think I also really like are the badass enemies and deaths. The enemies are especially cool looking and you can clearly see the work put into them. The game is not that long it took me 18 hours but everyone who plays this game will definitely play this game multiple times so the $60 are worth it for this game. This game really reminds me of Batman Arkham Asylum and it really is a good game. I really enjoyed this game it is unique and i'm sure that many people will enjoy this game. It has a impressive art style fun characters and in my opinion the small flaws diminished by all this games interesting features. It has the most fun gameplay since Dark Souls and nearly as rewarding. You really need to play this game its worth all your hard earned cash. The reason I am not giving this game a 10 is because its amazing but not a masterpiece but this franchise has the potential for glory. Buy this game it's gameplay is sooo much fun it's not difficult to get hooked in this game!. Dishonored is an absolutely phenomenal stealth/action game The first thing I love is the amount of ways you can approach the **** can be very stealthy or murder everyone,and your actions will determine the ending,so there is an incentive to play the game through twice. The gameplay is excellent,with great mechanics across the board for both action and stealth. There are a vast amount of powers to choose from,with Blink,a short range teleport,being the best of the **** AI is very smart,and the levels are designed brilliantly too. The graphics are pretty good,though the game does run into framerate issues,particularly if you blink to someone and kill them and their friend in quick succession. The story is well-written,with multiple endings as I said.I won't be spoiling either ending here. The sound design is very good,particularly the voice acting,and the soundtrack isn't half bad. Overall,Dishonored is an absolutely amazing game,and if you haven't played it,go out and get it!. I love and adore this game hoping the new one is better the down sides of the original game are the stealth factor is little to difficult and the combat is to but everything else is great. Dishonored Untapped Potential Dishonored is a first person action stealth game where you play as an assassin... the bodyguard of an empress who gets murdered and her daughter gets kidnapped within the first 10 minutes of the game… Naturally you’re framed as others are hungry for power… So the game really starts with you in a jail cell on a rescue mission… You’ll spend the game crawling through sewers and small cities going after a target in each of the 9 total missions… These missions last about an hour long highly dependent on your gameplay style which is such a great thing… Dishonored offers ultimate freedom in the way other assassin games like hitman and assassins creed have lost sight of with their highly suggested stealth design… Here you get a blade and a pistol… how you get to the end is up to you… From how you deal with situation to how you infiltrate areas… There’s multiple passage ways into every section… You can sneak up behind enemies to assassinate them or put them to sleep… You can straight up go in guns and swords blazing… There’s a catch though… the way you play effects the story. The ending and how other characters portray you… You can literally beat the entire game without killing anyone... While at the same time you can kill almost anyone you want at any time you want while again you can play anyway you like... I played as an aggressive assassin opposed to a ninja assassin… and I found that this game was definitely designed more for the patient type as the combat feels just a tad bit awkward… Its bearable, but the rag doll physics, awkward weapon wheel, occasional lack of hit detection, and unrealistic blocking abilities of guards made it apparent combat while an option was an afterthought… The most annoying thing that stuck out time after time was enemies that are about to shoot you, naturally you’d assume when they are readying their pistol, it’s the perfect opportunity to strike… But the guards would always.. And I mean always. Instantly block me when I took such a natural and realistic opportunity to deal damage… That single bit alone hurts hand to hand combat the most as the rest is pretty decent, you can block and parry, dual weald crossbows, guns, and swords… And if you feel more like going in stealthy, you can also use magic in your ranged weapon hand all of which can be swapped on the fly The magic is where the potential shines.. Every mission has runes hidden as well as bone charms… these charms are stat boosts and the runes unlock magic skills of your choice… You can unlock a dash attack… unlock a skill to see through walls.. Summon rats to eat enemies… just to name a few... These skills could’ve been used for side quests in the city or platforming sections, but they weren’t... they were just there... much like everything else, optional... The optional with the magic though is a letdown as there so much imbalance in game progression and this could have helped it Its constant sneaking around or fighting… There are no puzzles, no adventure sections to give you a chance to breathe… It’s a constant walking on eggs shells which ultimately makes this rescue mission feel more like a chore than an immersive duty, despite a handful of side missions actually showing great promise of what this series can become… Dishonored definitely has its flaws, but it also has potential and is a must play for any fan of the stealth genre I give Dishonored an 8.0/10. What can I say, It is a great game, the graphics are superb, the story could be better, but the game imerses you from the start and takes you an a fun and moving very exciting journey in this fabulous victorian/ 21 st century mix of a world. Unusual choice of setting, but this allows the character to move though a very intricate and stunning world. It vaguely reminded me of bioshock with it's old world and advanced technology, but this added to the plot. In short, a must play.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Repeatitive gameplay.. overhyped... not as good as people say it is... mediocre story and it became boring. Not as good as I was told it is... barely a 7 from me. **** game can not **** stand it. graphics are **** environments are **** it is painted with****. **** **** arsegargler game for **** i can not stomack it. Best game I played in a long time. I didn't know what to expect from this game, from start it was okay but then I got really into it. Game you need to play if you're a gamer.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. So much variety, so much fun - so much replayability. Wonderful environments with many paths to completion. Beautifully consistent tone. Great DLC, too - expands on the main story and adds new mechanics that fit well in the established setting.. Has been fun at stages, you know..... Oh who am I kidding? This game is amazing! Even though I repeated the game 5 times, it still surprises me in every choices I make. I really love games that let's you decide on a situation and carves the story through your decisions. Great work Arkane! Keep it up!. Dishonored is quite possibly the best game Bethesda has ever made. It's even better than Skyrim and Fallout 3 in my opinion. Dishonored has a fantastic story line with characters that are likable. The stealth of Dishonored is amazing,the game gives you many different routes when playing. For example there some guards blocking my path,should I kill them or go the rooftops where I can get to my destination without alerting them and without killing them? That's what I love about this game it lets you experiment with different ways to get to your assassination target. You can beat the entire game without killing anyone ,including the assassination targets. A lot of people complain about the graphics, but I love them. The graphics make this game look like an oil painting in motion. The game offers an rpg like system where collecting items called runes allow you to get new ability's and upgrade them, I mean who doesn't like summoning a swarm a rats to eat your enemies alive? The only problem I have with this game is that it's kind of short if you don't go for any gold or don't upgrade much you can beat the game in about 4 hours. Despite the short length Dishonored is a fantastic game. How good is it? When completed the game for the first time,I immediately started a new game.. This is one of Bethesda's lesser known releases, but should not be missed. While it does not have the large open worlds that titles like Skyrim and Fallout and is more linear, it still offers a decent sized world to explore and decisions to make. The story and environment are very interesting and enjoyable, though some of the characters lack substance and are easily forgettable. The mechanics of the game are unique and once you get the hang of them become very fun with a wide range of options ranging from stealth to full out assault.. A glorious first person experience. The stealth mechanics are a joy and the supernatural powers enable you to feel like something more. The story is original and brilliant. But where Dishonoured thrives the most is through the endless freedom it gives you. Do you charge through the game cutting down all in your path? Or do you sneak through the levels silently subduing enemies? The choice is yours and your choice of strategy effects the outcome of the game. It's nice to see less scripting and more choice. The game lacks multiplayer but the pedigree that this game is able to mark without multiplayer is quite incredible. A beautifully made game that is more than a pleasure to play. One of the generations special games.. A very interesting and unique stealth game. You play as the assassin Corvo Attano, who witnesses the murder of the royal empress kaldwin and is blamed for it, hence ""dishonored"". The world of Dunwall where the game takes place is a corrupt dystopian world with plaques, tyrannical leaders, and of course conspiracies. It doesn't say when it takes place, but it has a Victorian steampunk hybrid look to it and it is awesome. Corvo escapes from the prison he was held in and joins some revolutionary movement that wants to take take down the corrupt leader and put empresses daughter Emily Kaldwin on the throne. Most of the characters are very boring and don't show any emotion at all, except for Emily of course. Every time your told to go assassinate some bad guy, sure you may know why, but the bad guy doesn't ever come off as truly evil so there doesn't feel like any true motivation to kill. I wish there where more cool villains in games these days like Vaas and Handsome Jack. There is a plot twist towards the end, you can see it from a mile away. While the story has some problems, the most important part of any game got the most love here, which is the gameplay. The game takes place over 9 different missions, and each one is a mini sandbox. They are fully explorable with no invisible walls that I could find and the only thing stopping you being the laws of physics. You are tasked with different objectives within each level, and there all very diverse. There's tons of different ways to approach these objectives which gives the game a lot of replay value. You can run in and stab and shoot every guy, or freeze time and just walk through, or set spike traps in specific places for enemies to walk into, or teleport all over the place to sneak around them, there is so much diversity. How much fun you'll have depends on how creative you are. And I like that the alternate endings and the way the story plays out depends on your actions in the gameplay itself rather than just pressing one button or another in a cutscenes like in other games. At the end of each mission you are ranked with either low of high chaos. If you set off alarms and stab every throat you see, you get high chaos, but play it stealthy and spare enough lives and keep it quiet, you will get low chaos. I mostly played stealthy but every once in a while got in a bloody sword fight because stealth was too tricky, but still got low chaos overall. No matter which way you play, the game will still challenge you. Big sword fights are frantic and tough, but sneaking around is also nerve wracking and can be broken with one little slip. At times the game can be a bit frustrating. A lot of times I would be trying to be stealthy and guys would come running after me and I had no way of knowing how I got caught. But god the most part it's a legitimate challenge, unlike most games these days. I didn't come across any glitches in my playthrough, and the graphics are very unique. Some people say this game has ugly graphics, we'll duh it's not trying to look photorealistic. It has a unique art style that goes with the steampunk world. The game also has great sound design, the weapons and magical powers have cool sound effects when you use them. The city itself has these sound of steam machines and metal clanking and buzzing sounds that really give it that industrial feel and it sounds awesome. I really wish there was there was more interesting enemies to fight. Most of the time you'll just be confronted with boring guards, but there are also infected zombie like people and other assassins who can teleport. The only stand out enemy is the stilt walkers as they are big scary and challenging to get around. If they see you prepare for a pain of a fight. If you like stealth games, then this is certainly a must have for it's stellar gameplay, after all that's the most important part. It's something unique, refreshing, and original and I would love to see a sequel and this being turned into a franchise. There's a lot more I want to learn about this unique world. Just don't have high expectations for the plot, I do hope they make a better plot if there is a sequel.. this game is so epic it the people who say this is repitive haven't played for 10 minutes its a good game you a very strong assassin looking for revenge and the game is so realistic that you would want to sell your call of duty black ops 2 copy. Dishonored blends a great plot, wonderful stylized graphics, excellent non-linear feel, and great completion variety to the missions. You will discover a style of gameplay that works for you in the first couple of missions and spend the rest of the game perfecting it. I love the dynamic environments that change as you complete missions to reflect the style of gameplay you have chosen. Go through levels as death incarnate and kill all you see? Watch the world grow darker, more dangerous, and more plague infested. Slip through levels like a shadow, making your enemies disappear without a trace? Watch the city begin to come back to life and the plague wither. Loads of replay-ability coupled with all of the things listed above and this game is nearly perfect. The only two gripes I have are a soundtrack that disappears and is totally forgettable, and graphics that are definitely showing their age. Seriously, I thought I was playing Half-Life 2 again. A must play for any assassin lover.. Nice graphics. Very interesting design. Okay story line. Confusing gaming elements. Not much fun to play. It was a good attempt at making an interesting video game. However, the pacing is off putting and there are ways to fail in which you cannot go back. You have to make use of the saves, which is not something I wish to do.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. I think of this game as a combination of lots of game so its basicly, Bioshock + Skyrim + Assassins creed = Dishonored but it doesn't make it the perfect game it was a short story with 10 missions (Not counting DLC) But I just didn't get that much gameplay out of it. I give it 7/10 it had good voice acting and good characters but not as good as some of my favorites.. One of the best games of 2012, Dishonored excels in visuals, story and obviously gameplay. The stealth is very engaging and full of depth and care. And your targets actually feel repulsive and evil. The missions are very open, and you can even do extra side activities to boost your scores. You will constantly be replaying missions to see if you missed anything. The story is compelling, and the voice acting is top notch. While the Good/Evil system works awfully, and missions get frustratingly hard. Dishonored is one of the most engaging stealth games of all time.. This game's unique, but also irritable. There are many strong points and flaws throughout the major factors of the game. These factors to me are: stealth, combat, story, graphics, maneuverability, and replay value. The story overall is not mind-blowing, but reasonable. Some characters and settings are completely bizarre and some stand out great for the game's overall storyline. I've seen better storytelling in videogames. The graphics overall are fine and compete with about any other game. Maneuvering and the parkour system are important things for a stealth game like this. Jumping over objects and sliding below airlines feel great. The parkour system actually feels special because you can actually see the motion of the first person graphically. The system though is also a nuisance because you need to be in a close distance, or you can only climb an object if you press the button in the right amount of time. Because of this the system feels tighter compared to other games. Combat is more chaotic than what I ",dishonored was one of the best immersive sims of its time . it established Arkane as a studio to follow . drew influences from games like Bioshock and Thief .
524.CTR: Crash Team Racing,"CTR is undoubtedly Sony's response to Diddy Kong Racing, but it's more than a shameless rip-off. All the joy from Rare's racer is successfully translated to the PlayStation and refined to a spectacular polish, with some of its own twists.. CTR is the best kart racer i ever played. amazing track design. amazing adventure mode. an ok battle mode but who really cares in my opinion. and time trials the biggest part of the yeah drive as fast as posibble to beat ghosts (n tropy and oxide) CTR is a really competetive game and that's why new comers can have a really bad time with it figuring out drifting u turning air braking remembering the tracks shortcuts and really without the time trial mode or a speedrunning community this game would be practically dead. Rev your engines, folks! Crash Team Racing is the ultimate way to settle arguments with friends—who needs a therapy session when you can throw a blue shell at your buddy instead? The tracks are colorful, the power-ups are glorious, and the nostalgia hits harder than a well-aimed missile. Sure, I might have cursed at the screen after losing a race (sorry, mom!), but that just means I care, right? 10/10 would totally spin out of control again!. This game is easily the best cart racer on the ps1 or even like in the top 3 ever made. The only thing I wish was in this game was being able to hold speed while inputting the U-turn technique from the ps4 version other than that this game is amazing.. So no one told you life was gonna be this wayYour job's a joke, you're brokeYour love life's DOAIt's like you're always stuck in second gearWhen it hasn't been your day, your week, your monthOr even your year, butI'll be there for you(When the rain starts to pour)I'll be there for you(Like I've been there before)I'll be there for you('Cause you're there for me too)You're still in bed at tenAnd work began at eightYou've burned your breakfastSo far, things are going greatYour mother warned you there'd be days like theseBut she didn't tell you when the world has broughtYou down to your knees thatI'll be there for you(When the rain starts to pour)I'll be there for you(Like I've been there before)I'll be there for you('Cause you're there for me too)No one could ever know meNo one could ever see meSeems you're the only one who knowsWhat it's like to be meSomeone to face the day withMake it through all the rest withSomeone I'll always laugh withEven at my worst, I'm best with you, yeahIt's like you're always stuck in second gearWhen it hasn't been your day, your week, your monthOr even your yearI'll be there for you(When the rain starts to pour)I'll be there for you(Like I've been there before)I'll be there for you('Cause you're there for me too)I'll be there for youI'll be there for youI'll be there for you('Cause you're there for me too). What a classic kart racing game. I personally like the rubberbanding in this game. It's hard, yes, but it's damn fun!!! There's no other kart racer that has vibrant gameplay as CTR!!!. If you are looking for skill based kart racer, this is the game for you. If you are looking for a mario kart clone, you will not like this, **** you are loking for a traditional racing game, this isn't the game for you. If you like power ups and racing with them, it's a viable way to play, When you learn how the boost mechanic and boost storage works, you can race without any power ups, and it's completely viable. Realistically you will start lapping most of the ai, on any difficulty. That takes time, and understanding of the mechanics. It fulfils a niche that only it's sequel nitrokart fulfills. It's the best kart racer on ps one, It doesn't suffer from rubber banding, Oh and I guess if you like Crash bandicoot it has that going for it as well.. For my CTR originals 1999 are best video games at the time for original playstation. Crash Team Racing is an immersive racing game with lovable characters, stunning graphics, and intuitive controls. It never gets old with its variety of tracks and characters to choose from, and the attention to detail makes each track feel like a unique environment full of personality.. This is a Mario Kart clone, I was bored within 5 minutes. Not a real racing game.. The best kart game ever even if you compared it to today kart games, the gameplay mechanic, the character, the handling, everything is perfect if you are a fan of kart games. This game is a huge middlefinger to nintendo and I love it. Gran Turismo 4 is incredible but you shouldn't leave bad reviews on Crash Team Racing because it took the first place in the ranking both games are incredible for their respective player base. The greatest kart racer I ever played. Thank you for the memories. I still rock nginlabs and penta time trial to this very day. Absolutely one of the greatest with the best mechanics. Thank you Nd. Incredibly fun game, I love getting to play it with my girlfriend. It's nostalgic and feels very familiar to play for me, but I am confident any newcomers will be able to get right into it with ease too.. great game, amazing gameplay, amazing graphics at the time and so fun to play. CTR is marvelous for casual and competitive players alike. Naughty Dog nailed the handling and balance of the various karts and mechanics in addition to the excellently varied and themed tracks to create endless replay value.. Childhood classic. Tons of fun, Hundreds of hours played with friends. This has it all. Nostalgia included.. This game is such a classic, honestly quite baffled its only an 8.8. This game was so much fun and it still is to this day you don't have to worry about losing money or getting upgrades, it was pure skill and the fact that there are people who review bomb this game are in 2023 speak ''L at games''. Honestly though you play as different types of characters and they all have unique personality's and that is so awesome! There are even boss fights that are 1v1s with other characters on their own stage! Forget what people put on here it's quite honestly garbage hell you don't have to listen to what I say you can stay in your own little bubble and keep your opinions but I just want people to know that these scores don't freaking matter. Thank you for listening to my TedTalk!. I dont understand the hype behind the game honestly. Yea its nostalgic, retro, quite fun, but in reality its like any other arcade kart racing game. This is the definitive arcade kart racer for the PlayStation! It has the mascot of the console, do i need to explain further?. F*** Mario Kart. That is all I have to say but I need 75 characters to post a review.. The best kart racer to date. Surpasses Mario Kart through the adventure mode - providing a story-based single player game mode, with relics, taken from the Crash platformers, and CTR races to provide different objectives in a game genre which can become stale with standard single-player racing.. TBH. Why people would rate this game super high and stole the number one spot when other goat like Gran turismo 4 Or Burnout 3? sure it pretty much the rivals of mario kart. but imma say this. nothing personal. but you're furries. that why.... uka uka came into my house and slapped me sooo hard so now i need to rest for 1 weeks 11/10. This game is a true masterpiece. The best kart racer I've ever played. The controls are as smooth, floaty and yet, also fast at the same time. There so many intricate techniques that allow you to go faster and perfect your time driving the tracks. The adventure mode is great and filled with personality and charm from all the characters. I love the way this game looks as well. Great for 1999.. Sony Computer Entertainment America's Crash Team Racing for the PlayStation is an excellent game!. The GOAT. Easily the best kart racing game and the best naughty dog game.... for some reason MetaCritic is making me use the points out of 10 system, so i’ll just say here: i give this game 87/100.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. The best kart racing game ever. I played it as a kid and still play it until now. You can play adventure mode, where you can see story and later unlock some new characters. You can try race against a time in time trial or just goofing around in single race mode or battle arena. One thing I wished for, were more playable characters from Crash franchise or simply from previous 3 games by Naughty Dog like N.Brio, Tawna, Koala Kong, Komodo Moe.... ----------------------------------------------------------------------8=Great---------------------------------------------------------------------. A genuinely fun Mario Kart knock off that sometimes beats Mario Kart at its own game. You can race regularly, or play a story mode that adds a great deal of replay value and longevity to the game.. This is a Kart racer really focused on skill. Give the right amoung of time of learn the mechanics and the game turns into a incredible experience. There is also a lot of single player content for casual players, such as the adventure mode (that any kart racer should have, in my opinion). For me, a perfect game for the genre.. Crash's first attempt at a kart racer is possibly the best one of all time. When universal wanted a new crash game but naughty dog wanted to make a racer there was only one thing that was going to happen. Enter crash team racing. It looked quite like crash 3 and ran smoothly. It has such an amazing control system that should be the envy of many kart racers even over 20 years later. It has an average enough story but its ok because it doesn't really need one. The game holds up well today and will always be very fun and satisfying, its great that its since been remastered in 2019 in crash team racing nitro fueled. In a nutshell its a classic and easily tops mario kart 64 in every way.. This is not only great game but also, a great story! It is deep and exciting without ""fedex' quests. That' is something that for example. Simply the best kart racing game ever. I played it all the time as a kid and I finally finished the campaign in the remake for PS4. Can't recommend this game enough.. The best drift game of all time, it's fun to do endless powersliding........ This game is certainly AMAZING. It’s definitely a 9/10 rated game for me.. TheElusivePossom and Raywlk, you both are garbage. This game is good and you two aren't.. The best kart racer I have ever played. Tight and responsive controls Amazing level design and great amount of replay value and unlockables especially for the glories adventure mode and the level of mastery and the amount of secret shortcuts you can take in the levels make this game a blest to play. This game holds up so well even with the release of nitro fueled. Pretty nice game, I got this on my Ps3 to emulate a while back. The cut-scenes were mediocre, the boss races were ok. Nice game for its time. But i have to rate nitro kart better because i prefer the cut-scenes and unlockables , but again decent game. A clear Mario Kart ripoff with many instances of insensitive and racist characters. And yet, this game brought me closer to my dad and is a blast to play so it's my problematic fave.. Crash Team Racing is just a gem! Absolute masterpiece of gaming! Blast of awesomeness! Even after 20 years Crash holds his scepter of greatness high! I cannot praise this game enough! It's absolute wonder! Unparalleled racing experience!. Crash Bandicoot is the King of platform gaming! And Crash Team Racing is the absolute King of karting! (original Mario Kart pales in comparison to original CTR). Crash Team Racing is just genius. It's simple, it's beautiful, it's hard, it's rewarding, it's addictive, it's everything that you wish from a kart racer. I LOVE IT! IT IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!. That is THE BEST racing game EVER created!!! For me, it's just perfect. Original, now considered retro, aged superbly well. New remaster is also wonderful, but biggest emotions always will bind me with this original crash. I just love it since 1999!!!. The best game ever made so far! Nobody matched it´s quality. This game is absolute perfection.. 20 years later and not a single kart racing game can beat CTR in terms of kart control and how rewarding it feels.. Great kart racer, lots of fun to be had, BUT it's absolutely unforgivable to only be in 30fps, and to be honest it feels lower at times. It's quite frankly depressing to see so many people letting it slide or making excuses for it. By going 4k 30 instead they have prioritised marketing over gameplay; that means the opinion of someone who hasn't even bought the game is more important to them than the experience of someone who's handed over the cash. Wake up sheeple.. I still play and enjoy this game. + Adventure mode + great controls and gameplay + items +++ boosting mechanic!! + really fun coop experience This far better than Mario kart imo! The boosting and drifting mechanic is much better than in mario kart. This game is easy to pick up and play, but very hard to master. Mario kart is more kid friendly and it definitely is easier game to play than ctr. 10/10 easily. The best racing game for a family of all ages. Easy to play, but hard to master. The only game that in its time could compete with 'Mario Kart'. A game in which after many years you can still play and play from the fact of its universality.. The Character roster might seem small but theres 7 more character to unlock (including the Penta Penguin), Tracks are unique you won't see those kinds of tracks in Mario Kart 64 (at least some of them) . Some items are just from Mario Kart theres few thats unique like the bowling bomb and TNT/Nitro Crates. Story is also bit weird but it was late 90's so yeah... This game is a CLASSIC! but theres few stuff that i didnt liked about: -Bosses cheat Example: Ripper Roo just spams those TNT Crates -Missiles are a bit broken they dont seem to work like red shells from Mario Kart 64 when the target is very far away the Missile tries to go shortest way to target... and hits something... but its a great game you should play Original or Nitro Fueled it doesnt matter its just great!. This is a **** fantastic unparalleled kart racer I would recommend to anyone. Play it for your self and you will see what I mean. 9.8/10. Favorite racing game of my childhood. Probably hundreds of hours put into it.. A really good game, there are lots of cool things about it and it is a lot of fun to play.. one of the best games of ps1 . i love it when i was a child and i love it now .. In 2018 this is still the best karting game ever created. Unforgettable tracks, unique characters and above all perfect gameplay. Difficulty level is well-balanced too - from adventure mode on easy difficulty to beating Nitros Oxide on every track in time trial mode. This is my favourite game of all time.. Crash Team Racing captures the magic of racing games and combines it with the awesome Crash Bandicoot skin perfectly.. Great racing game with good graphics for its times, good replay value and a very challenging Story Mode, specially the Time Trials. Reccomended!. To this game one of the best kart racing games. Good tracks and roster and the controls and items are easy to grasp. Better than Mario Kart for its time. No idea why they didn't make a new one. The mechanics were on point.. At that time, racing games with characters from different universes were on top. But this game was the best of the best. Bosses were amazingly good. Gameplay was simple but great. I could re-play the story mode several times and get satisfied every time! Great example of kart games. All the courses are original and amazing. A perfect ripoff of Mario Kart. And for Naughty Dog's last game with Crash in it, they did a well job. Fantastic game!. One of the absolute best kart racer's ever to be made. The controls are absolutely perfect, everything just flows and once you've played for a while you'll feel like a master at the game. Since they are remaking the original trilogy of Crash games, would it be too much to ask for this game to be remade with online multiplayer? The new Mario Kart is a blast to play online with friends (or you'll just be raging depending on how good/lucky you are) and I really feel that this game could be amazing with new graphics. There are no kart racers on the PS4 that are any good so currently there is a massive opening for a remake of this game.. 9.5 - Classic and nostalgic, fantastic kart racing game. Definitely up there with Mart Kart quality, but it has its own style that makes it much different from that. There is plenty of tracks with great variety and awesome characters with hilarious voice acting.. This is the best racing game I have ever played. It's not got as many extras as some racing games out there, but it's really fun to play and I can keep coming back to it. There's not really too many frustrating moments in this one, unlike a lot of racing games. I even keep coming back to the main story mode, because of how great it is. This to me beats Mario Kart any day.. The controls on this game are better than anything since. Also the types of weapons you can fire at people. Thats what makes it better than any Mario Kart games. Crash Team Racing is a game where you can play alone or with friends , is a driving video game , for example, the general characteristics are similar to Mario Kart. Crash Team Racing is a kart racing video game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. + Most Fun Racing Kart Game I have Played + Campaign and Challenges + Great Circuits. Crash Team Racing is a kart racing video game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. + Most Fun Racing Kart Game I have Played + Campaign and Challenges + Greats Circuits. While everything in this game surely is nice and it doesn't appear to have aged very badly, it still has its problems. The tracks seem like a random mess more than a carefully constructed racing environment. The characters are nice, nobody new there, however their voice acting sounds like a mediocre fandub. What comes to items, they are nice, but there aren't enough of them. Thanks to the notable amounts of Wumpa fruit the game gives to you, they become very powerful far too easily. Crash Nitro Kart fixed all of those problems, with improved track design that even features anti-gravity. The voices are redone, and while Wumpa can be acquired by hitting other racers, overall it's much more difficult to get, making the weapons less powerful. The homing missile now actually needs some skill as it's slower and harder to lock on. Explosions are also smaller, and shields can be used with other weapons. Most importantly, triple weapons are no longer given randomly: you have to break a special box in a difficult section of the track to gain them. What DIDN'T change between the games is the drifting system. I guess the fans loved it too much to have it fixed. It's not that bad, just ""hard to learn, easy to master"" style. Overall, it's a great game with lots of great stuff. You can see the other reviews for the positives.. Crash Team Racing is a bit different from the previous three installments in the series. Naughty Dog wanted to say goodbye to our favorite marsupial in style, and thus the ""best kart racer ever"" was born. With 15 playable characters, multiplayer, and tons of game modes this game NEVER gets old. Even doing time trials is a thing that you can go back to once or twice a year. I think that this game is easy enough for kids, but provides challenge for adults too. I honestly doubt there will be a better or half as good kart racer ever in humanity's history.. The best crash racer is this fun game that is fun to play with others. The graphics look great and the courses are awesome so are the controls. This game is also nostalgic.. Finally something great in the saga of Crash Bandicoot, a race with all the characters of the first trilogy, excellent animation levels of cars and characters very easy to play, very entertaining.. Crash Team Racing on the Playstation is a great cart racer based upon the superb Crash Bandicoot games. It has great colorful graphics for the original Playstation and the typical music (with a lot of percussion) that true fans will recognise from the Crash Bandicoot games. Crash Team Racing is much better than its successors Crash Nitro Cart (2003) and Crash Tag Team Racing (2005) for the PS2. It's much more faithfull to the original Crash games in it's visuals and characters, and it has the same near perfect gameplay. The only little remark I have, is that the button to use your weapons (the circle button) is a bit of a bad choice because you have to let go of the button to drive (the cross button) in order to press it. I enjoyed the versus mode most of all. Crash Team Racing can be played with up to 4 players (using a multi-tap) and the courses are very varied, interesting and fun. For me Crash Team Racing is one of the best games on the PS. I rate this game 10 out of 10.. Crash Team Racing was really one of the biggest games on PlayStation. I remember when I played it in the early 2000s. I had a false copy of this game, not the original, but it was something quite common at the time. I immediately fell in love with this game. It was funny, the car driving was done really well, the tracks also (apart from a few) were nice. Also, the weapons system was comfortable to use, and had a very good feedback. The story was simple, but still fun, and the characters were great. Challenges against bosses were very good, and each of them was more difficult to beat than the last, and made ​​good impression of increasing difficulty. Two or more players mode was fantastic and well balanced. In addition to the main mode, there were many challenges to complete and collectible to obtain that kept busy for a long time. It is truly one of the most great, if not the greatest, racing game of all time; but probably the biggest advantage of this game was the fact that it never makes you tired of it. And this is why I still play it even after a decade of years. One of the best games made by Naughty Dog, and a true masterpiece.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Bringing the Crash Bandicoot characters into a cart racing game was awesome news back then. I spent countless hours on Crash Team Racing. It was a very cool addictive karting game with tight controls and fun weapons to blast through the opponents. This was in my opinion, one of the best racing game on the PlayStation One.. I got this in the 99 cent PS Store Easter sale and find it as boring as it was when I played it years ago at my friends house when it was new. Those that enjoy this over Mario Kart either have never played a single Mario Kart or are possibly biased. It mildly reminds me of Diddy Kong Racing, instead of collecting bananas to pick up speed you hit crates with oranges and if you get 10 you get special versions of items and apparently a speed boost but there is no sense of one on screen. The levels are as complex as that Hello Kitty racer that released on Wii U recently and the controls are the definition of clunk. I will give it this, the title did make me realize Crash Bandicoot is the Gary Busey of gaming, in the beginning he was alright... sometimes great but fast forward to now he is just a crazy nut with a nutzo gimmick.. Best kart racing game ever (Mario Kart Double Dash is a distant second best). And also the mode where you can play tag to blow each other up one-on-one is so much fun, it never gets old.. Does this surpass ""Mario Kart""? yes it does! This is THE game that made kart racing. Solid and responsive gameplay wiith fun mechanics. Cartoon-style graphics and brilliant use of colors and textures. Typical and enjoyable Crash music. Best multiplayer racer game. If it only could have online features ""sigh"". So grab three friends and have a blast with Crash Team Racing!. a great kart racing game made CRASH BANDICOOT and its opponents famous characters ,i'm still playing this game a game full of fun especially in multiplayer mode. Best Game Ever! Only reason I still have my Playstation 2. The driving, the controls, the maps, the characters, everything is just perfect! You can even buy it on PS3 now, I hope they do this aswell for PS4!. after mario kart 64,this my favourite racing game it had a good story,and good graphics with a great gameplay and great characters the last great game of crash bandicoot. I gave this game a 7, this is also my favorite game. This is my favorite because In my opinion, a favorite game is s game where you can keep on playing without getting bored or not finding the game repeating itself or having stupid things like quick time events. This game is has many flaws glitches ect. That's why I am not giving it a 10. But I am giving it, my favorite game. The highest ranking a game can get.. crash team racing is similar to mario kart it borrows the idea but improve it in every way the sound is amazing m levels and characters are good and a really addictive game play that i never be bored with the best kart eveeeeeer!. My first game on Playstation 1, I don't even remember the first time I've played it, but it doesn't matter, I still play it today and I enjoy it like I always did. As a kid I played it with my two brothers ALL NIGHT LONG. Great times.. About the game: awesome kart steering, interesting power-ups and weapons can be found during the race, large choice of extremely fun maps in which i think all of them have a secret route shortcuts, great graphics for it's time, a lot of characters to be chosen, awesome ""adventure mode"" and unforgettable multiplayer races. Absolutely one of my all time favorites! 10/10. It's the funnest, yet most blatant Mario Kart rip-off to date, and definitely one of the funnest in the franchise. A visual delight for its time and packed with a variety of characters, weapons, and tracks, CTR is definitely worth your $6 on the PSN.. The best racing game in my opinion. I like character roster, levels, adventure mode and music is pretty good. Gameplay is addicting and game includes very much platforming, what is a good thing. This beats every Mario Kart game there is.. Crash Team Racing is the final Crash game developed by Naughty Dog and is something we haven't seen Crash do before. That is racing of course. The story of the game is that an intergalactic villain names Nitrous Oxide has kidnapped Crash, Cortex and the rest of the gang. The gameplay is very well played and the graphics are well designed. I can't stand it when people say ""this game is a ripoff of Mario Kart"" because Mario Kart was not the first racing game. Neither is Crash but it improves on what most of the other cart racers didn't have. This game is worth a look at. Not too many racing games have a good story and stellar gameplay like this game. Lag might occur occasionally, but if you have not played this game since 13 years ago when it was released, it is definitely worth a try.. This is the best game of all time. Perfect just prefect and mario kart can't challenge with it CTR is better than Mario kart in all things. Naughty Dog I LOVE YOU :). One of the very few best kart racing games for the PS1 which crash team racing is a perfect example to this before Naughty dog no longer had the rights to produce another crash game and selling off to a different company. Story- Pretty obvious. The bad guy challenges you to whatever he decides in which case kart racing and you must defeat otherwise the bad guy will take over the planet and either destroy, or enslave the living around still awesome plot line for a kart racer. Graphics- Not too much to explain since this was part of Naughty dog's involvementt with the game so its basically still a good cartoonish design to look into. Gameplay- Don't think for a moment that this is basically Mario Kart since it has similarity just don't be hating enjoy the game. You choose your favorite characters from crash, cortex, tiny, ****, etc while others can be unlocked through challenges involving CTR tokens in the story mode of the game. races are usually 3 laps which you can make your decision in singles, vs racing. while the boxes with ? contain weapons you can use to help you out to your advantage while CPU can do the same thing. Doing slides can really help you out since if you press a button at the right time during the slide you will recieve additional boosts which having more wumpa fruits can also increase slightly, as well as making your weapons stronger, and last for a period amount of time. Stages feel fun to play even after a couple times still enjoyable. Battle mode is where you and your friends duke out to see who's better in hitting the most players or achieving the most objectives in the amount of time. Time Trial is getting the faster time and achiving time relics depending on how fast you finish the race. Overall- Still an enjoyable game even today it is amazing how it will always be a classic to kart racing on the playstation 1 though i wished that they would still make these amazing games though but that won't happen any time soon =( Final Score- 9.5 for racing enjoyment. Crash TR is undoubtedly a fun game with some of the best cartoonish tune and tone similar to the Crash games. With a lot of content addicting modes, tracks playability , makes the game a strong competitor of Mario Kart and other kart games.. This game is one of the best cart racers ever created, and finally a great one that isn't a Mario Kart racer. It is a near-perfect cart racer with great graphics and fun gameplay.. Even if it is a Mario Kart-knock off, it's not a bad game at all. In fact, it's one of the funnest racing titles on the PS one that never seems to get old, even going into 2012. Flashy with its colorful visuals and flawless graphics, but addictive with its variety of race tracks, weapons, and playable characters packed with charisma, this is one of the best Crash games to date.. CTR has great tracks, fun characters and plenty of game modes. Story mode has entertaining boss battles and integrates time trials and collectables. Arcade mode is great fun especially with friends as is the battle mode. Any fan of Mario Kart will find this similar but highly enjoyable in its own right.. Still an amazingly fun game and probably the best kart racing game next to the original Mario Kart. It's too bad all of the more recent kart racers (with the exception of DS) are nowhere near as good.. The best kart racing game developed, even to this day. Every single map is beautifully designed and the game has loads of content to unlock and discover. The only flaw is that this game hasn't been remade compatible with an online feature yet.. It's a tad bit too obvious that it's mimicking Mario Kart 64, but it does it in all the right ways, making it just as innovative and essential to anyone's collection of PS1 games. Pros: Fantastic visuals, control, and course design; boss battles; single-player and multi-player mode are endless amounts of fun; lots of extras and unlockables; the hubworld is a nice addition to the adventure mode. Cons: It's a tad bit too easy; it's not as great as Mario Kart 64.. After all these years we thought Nintendo was the only company that produced decent kart games for their consoles, well finally the Playstation has its own clone, Crash Team Racing. Created and Developed by Naughty Dog, Crash Team Racing is a kart racing game where the player can choose to play as any of the characters in the Crash series (even the bad guys if you want, I always choose Crash because he's my favourite). There are five different modes to choose from: Adventure, Time Trial, Arcade, Verses and Battle. ""Adventure"" mode is the main story of the game. You start off in the arena where you can drive around and practice some skills such as hopping, drifting and power sliding. The main goal is to win trophies by coming in first place, ","this is Sony's response to Diddy Kong Racing, but it's more than a shameless rip-off . the game is easily the best cart racer on the ps1 or even like in the top 3 ever made . the only thing i wish was in this game was being able to hold speed while inputting the U-turn technique ."
525.Crusader Kings II: The Old Gods,"Great game! /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////. Adds a great amount of depth and replayability to what is already an astounding strategy game. Combine this with all the other DLC and you have one of the most enjoyable and time devouring games in PC history. You will literally lose months of your life to this.. This expansion adds on to an already great game. It adds depth and an earlier start date along with making pagans playable. I give this amazing expansion and game 5 stars. This DLC allows you to start CK2 earlier in 867, which is fun in itself. But the real gain is the addition of playable pagans, from Norse Vikings through to Steppe Nomads. Lots of fun added to an already great game.. The idea is good, but the Paganism in this DLC is like a bigot's cartoon version of the old European religion, and no thought seems to have been given to the fact that all the pre-Christian Europeans had (what was basically) the same religion, only with different names on the deities and a few local customs here and there. In this game I can ""convert"" Slavic Pagans to Norse Paganism. Right.... Slavic is a language group, by the way, not a culture, religion or people. So religion follows languages in this game... ok. Sorry, but this doesn't make any sense. How exactly is it you will convert a Slavic-speaking Pagan to Norse Paganism? Can't you just teach him Norse language instead, and call it ""language education""? His religion will be the same anyhow... Do you need to ""convert"" a French Catholic to German Catholicism too? What if he knows both French and German? The main focus in The Old Gods is the Norse Paganism, and the ultra-Christian and hateful stereotyping of the good and honourable Norsemen dominates everything here. So Pagans have to sacrifice people to their gods and to go to war in order to please the gods and their bloodthirsty populations. So that is what Paganism was about? Did Christians make this game, or what? That's laughable! There are no Old Gods in this DLC, only Old Hatred. The Christians still seem to hate the European religion (""Paganism""), and make it look completely idiotic and meaningless whenever they can, like in The Old Gods. Don't support people who make games that insult Europe and spread anti-Euroepan ignorance and hatred.. This game is absolutely amazing. Sure it has some quirks( i.e. un-scale-able user interface) but I have sunk 260 hours into this game and have only scratched the surface of the content. On top of the original size and quality of the game, Paradox continuously releases new patches and content enhancing the experience. This is especially important in a day and age where most companies cash in by releasing a buggy nightmare with no follow through or support.. Great DLC and It's fun to play as Norse Pagan. However, it does need some balancing. Especially in the regard of armies of the Norse lords. That, however, doesn't take the fun of playing with them, especially when you watch the infighthing between the lords to form the Northern Kingdoms. I would like to see a better form other than subjugation of a county to see a kingdom be created. It's a bit idealistic, considering Norse culture see the stronger as the most prepared to lead. It's addictive to keep trying different approaches to be King of Sweden or Norway, though.. No improvements to the multiplayer, balance got messed up even worse, half the dlc is taken out and sold as mini-dlc's, only something for hardcore fans.. Absolutely necessary addition to CK2 and well-made as well, but charging £9.99 for it is simply ridiculous. Reformation of pagan religions a very good idea but it still lacks ability to create custom-made empires.. I'm I'm willing to forgive the Paradox DLC show in this case since the core game is truly worth it. It seems almost a miracle that after years and years of making sausage machines, they have (perhaps by accident) arrived at the architectual basis for a TRULY GREAT GAME. Crusader Kings 2 is a great game. No mistake. But it's still a little shy of perfect. However rather than the mediocre expansions of other Paradox titles, we find (miraculously!) that the major DLC for CC2 REALLY is improving the game. If they somehow find the way to build a GAME around this engine: scenarios, campaigns, cut scenes, narratives: we could well end up with the supreme strategy video game experience! Power yo you Paradox! On to the peak! This team may be the first to scale the Everest of game design! Even short of perfection, what they are selling now is work every copek and every crown! If you haven't tried this game buy it now and ALL the DLC. Applause! Bravo! Bravo. TOG gives you a whole new set of rules, mechanics, and scenarios with which to create a fantastic, immersive narrative while in a sandbox-style game. If you liked the previous major DLC expansions, this one's a must-have (by far my favorite), probably adding the most content of any DLC yet-released. Religions, pagan religions, and even vassals are now all dramatically more fleshed-out, with CK2 now being a large handful of games' content all in one. Paradox also started adding many more context hints in this game, explaining certain effects which are temporary (for example previously, there were many actions which'd affect an NPC's opinion for x years, but the game never hinted at that now it gives specific durations for actions which affect opinion). I agree TOG does introduce a lot of questionable balance choices, though... In TOG's start date, there are a good few nations able to totally dominate the map within a couple decades, no matter which difficulty level you're playing at. Playing Norse effectively voids out the entire casus belli system (particularly if setting ambition to claim a kingdom) as you can declare wars against just about anyone for large pieces of territory for rapid, dramatic expansion. Rebellions have been revamped as well, and now are more along the lines of what's in Victoria II (though this mechanic still isn't nearly as complex as in V2). I'm not sure it really adds any benefit to the game other than flavor and some more chaos, which keeps the game from feeling stale. Some rebellions will require even large states to hire mercenaries and call in allies to defeat, which increases the risk of expanding exponentially faster than you assimilate newly-conquered lands. AI seems significantly improved, as NPCs seem more prone to aggressive expansion, quickly gobbling up tens of smaller states in a handful of years, than working up to defeating the larger ones which might not be historical so much, but is more balanced considering this is what players do. The Independent States tab in the ledger shrinks pretty quickly with time, and I don't think that's a bad thing at all. The DLC introduced a few new bugs, but mostly only text-related, and I haven't yet experienced a crash playing TOG for ~30 hours. For instance, sometimes choices in dialogue options won't show effects or who's affected, only icons, and there seem to be many more instances where a character's name is replaced with something like ""text_consort_titlename."" I'll also state support for how Paradox does DLC content, with fluffy stuff (new portraits and song packs) being sold for a buck or two, but with all the core changes being included in the main DLC. It lets me choose which content I want and don't want based on which nations/regions fit my usual playstyle. There's no invasive DRM, and the prices are very reasonable, so I'm a huge fan of Paradox's respect in general toward customers.. I don't think Paradox is selling hundreds of millions of dollars of product like Call of Duty or other big name products. So if they want to charge you a few bucks for portraits, songs, sprites, and DLC, I say more power to them. Keep the games coming! They aint gonna make this stuff for free: I am Looking at you Rekkie! That said, it adds a few hundred years of game play and a few new events. Playing as a norse is worth at least a game or two and defending as England or France against the Norse invaders is also fun. (Mind you a single game can last weeks or months of real time play!) All told: worth the price of admission if you liked the whole series. If you didn't, you probably aren't even reading this so Bugger Off!. Good DLC apart from the fact that they try to milk you for every last cent by making you buy the Norse portraits and unit pack separately! Seriously paradox stop being greedy! The $15 (AU) price tag on this is great but that is only when it is inclusive of the unit pack and portraits!. An excellent piece of DLC, although it does need some balancing. Norse rulers can invade just about anyone, and can frequently field unstoppable doomstacks. Still, playable pagans, another 200 years of history to play with... good work, Paradox.","adds depth and replayability to what is already an astounding strategy game . real gain is the addition of playable pagans, from Norse Vikings through to Steppe Nomads . the idea is good, but the Paganism in this expansion is like a bigot's cartoon version ."
526.Cocoon,"Marvellous game. So much creativity and mindblowing mechanics. I want more of this in games from now on! The game flow is the smoothest I've ever experienced, like you always know where to go, what to do, that you're doing it right and it all still super exciting.. One of the absolute best games I have ever played, and I normally hate puzzle games such as The Witness, this is up there with Ocarina of Time and Symphony of the Night!. The beginning is too easy and not very challenging, but in the end there are some great creative puzzles.. I really enjoyed this game. It starts pretty slow but unfold in a great way. The duration was perfect for me too. To me, It felt like Journey with puzzles, you're kinda wandering around and witnessing a world around you without a clue what is going on. At the end it gets Inception with the different worlds connecting to each other. I recommend to a friend.. The last part where worlds within worlds puzzles is where this game really shines, sad that it didn't last long before the game ends.. What a wonderful experience. I love puzzles and idea of solving them by putting world inside worlds was amazing. The game tells you its story through the gameplay mechanics, the environment and sounds!. No texts, no dialogue. I learnt so much about game design from this game. Incredible !. The achievement for completing the game on XGPU is called ""Cosmic Architect,"" which ties into the game's creation story. The final outcome resonates with the puzzles involved, even suggesting that the universe itself is nested within a known universe. The puzzles in the latter part of the game are particularly excellent, requiring you to think about how rings fit within other rings and also manage time. In terms of puzzle difficulty and entertainment value, it surpasses Monument Valley. It's one of the best puzzle games in recent years.. Love it, highly recommended to any puzzle enthusiast. Might be one of my all time favorites, definitely one of the best played in a while.. no birds but cool puzzle id generally say trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash trash. This is quite a tough one to rate because I'm not so keen on Puzzle games, but I did play Viewfinder in the past and it was a blast this game has puzzles, what I call visual Action and boss battles to mix things up. But I don't think this is a game that a lot of people would start to play and enjoy for the long term. The game is simplistic and beautifully crafted, it has a good gameplay loop. I'm going to give this an IGN 7/10. I think for puzzle lovers this is great but there isn't anything that I would call truly innovative on the indie side of gaming. I'm looking for games like Viewfinder Subliminal, stuff that takes the indie genre to another level(Not a pun) You know what I think I'm going to up this game by a point because it is pretty and nice to look at. and is worth the price of admission.. The world within world puzzles are quite inventive. It doesn't reach the heights of Limbo or Inside, but it's a worthwile addition to the collection.. Stylish art style, cool puzzles. I love how the game looks. Puzzles aren't too hard so there's no frustration. Nice transitions between words. Maybe little to short. The game looks beautiful, but I felt bored. I liked solving puzzles in Limbo, previous game of the developer, but in this game I didn't enjoy it so much. One of the best puzzle games I've played. Majestically beautiful, completely unique, perfectly balanced and paced. Absolutely loved it!. The puzzles are simply extraordinary. It's a very enjoyable game that you can finish in a long day playing or just a few hours per day. They did a great work here. Highly recommended.. You can complete Cocoon in a day without guides - well I did - not you Americans, you're all dumber than my dog (Is Rain Man still your most intelligent person?). So, you can't give 9/10 for this when you have huge games like GTAV/O & RDR2/O, which are technically vastly superior, with far more gameplay variety, open worlds, vehicles, etc. Maybe short games with fun gameplay, online play, and replay value can get 8/10, but Cocoon has none of that. Its gameplay mostly involves carrying 1-4 portal globes around small maps to jump to locations & progress. The gameplay/puzzling isn't fun, making you shout, ""Eureka!"", you don't feel smug, as it's usually just a case of discovering new controls/mechanics, or spotting something you didn't notice. A big problem with having several portals is that you can backtrack into areas that should be closed off when you're searching for the route forward. Different, but doesn't beat Inside or its great SFX. A chore: 5/10 Try Portal/Portal 2 instead, or Bramble.. Cocoon, a thought-provoking game, invites players to embark on a journey of self-discovery and existential inquiry. Through its innovative gameplay mechanics and surreal landscapes, the game critiques the human condition, echoing philosophers like Sartre and Heidegger. The ""cocooning"" mechanic represents the human desire for control and agency, nodding to Sartre's ""bad faith."" As players navigate the dreamlike realms, they confront the consequences of their actions, illustrating Heidegger's ""Being-in-the-world"" and the responsibility that comes with freedom. What sets Cocoon apart is its masterful blend of innovative gameplay and stunning visuals. The game's clever use of perspective-shifting and environmental puzzles creates a sense of wonder and discovery, immersing players in its mystical world. The vibrant, dreamlike art style, reminiscent of surrealist masterpieces, perfectly complements the game's philosophical themes, creating a truly unforgettable experience. By overcoming the game's clever challenges, players assert their agency and create their own meaning, illustrating existentialist principles. Cocoon's exploration of identity and selfhood critiques conformity, echoing Heidegger's ""The They."" With its unique gameplay and captivating visuals, Cocoon presents a profound philosophical exploration of the human condition, encouraging players to confront existence, freedom, and responsibility.. Superb art, design puzzle and sound design merge together in this neat perfectly formed, perfectly measured playtime, puzzle adventure game. Top class stuff!. A tutorial is not needed because the game is very intuitive and motivates you to reason and understand its mechanics, the interface is minimalist and very welcoming to the player, it makes you feel a commitment to the development of the game without the need to go into depth. the history. In conclusion, this game is ideal if you like intuitive mechanics and with a touch of patience to understand them, the more you get used to them, the game progresses on its own.. Puzzle game does not describe this ideally, since you would expect something more mind bending I guess. There are just some light puzzles while you progress along a given route, with no story. It is however beautiful and engaging. I think it should have stopped at 3 spheres to work with instead of 4 to stay in the sweet spot for me.. The level designers and animators made this game great. I found myself mesmerized by the intricacies and number of so many little well designed little movements the world makes. You open a door and there's like 50+ little elements moving and interacting with each other. To me this might be a masterclass in world design and the animations really bring it to life. There's a couple sparse little world building/story elements, it's mostly abstract and not the focus here. The puzzles range from neat to thought provoking (worlds inside worlds inside worlds...). It also does one of my favorite things in a game, organic teaching. There's no instructions nor even a word of text, is just puts stuff in front of you and lets you figure out how they work. It's short, but very sweet.. One thing that really stood out in this game is the creepy, out of this world music. The creepy alien world soundtrack really fits with the game. It does it really well. Another thing that stood out is the alien-like structures in the game. It was interesting to see what new things i would see in the new level and how it would transform into something really weird. I did like the puzzles a lot. This game is a puzzle game where you put item. A itnto placeholder B so you can get item C to do a thing that will let you through. It’s also a timing game where you have to shoot something at just the right time or run somewhere at just the right time to progress through the level. The game’s graphics are simple but colorful and just really goes well together. As a first person shooter gamer, I got stuck about 10 times and I had consult a walkthrough to get through the puzzles. Some of my frustrations were due to me forgetting to look at a specific item that was a little bit out of the way in the map. Overall, this game is fun and really gets you thinking sometimes. When you solve a level and figure out the puzzle, it’s very rewarding to know you solved it. Seeing new creatures and items makes each new level fresh and makes me super interested in finding out what’s next. I give it 10 out 10. Highly recommend Cocoon, even if you don’t play puzzle games. This is one not to be missed.. I don't have the patience I used to have for puzzle games but Cocoon got me back into the genre. The game accomplishes what many puzzle games don't. It makes you feel smart while never making you feel stupid. This means that the puzzle design is rarely obtuse while also never being too simple either. The game does a great job of subtley teaching you the mechanics of the puzzles by slowly increasing their complexity. It is a difficult game to describe with puzzle mechanics that are better left experiencing for yourself than over explained and potentially spoiled in my review. I beat this game in one sitting (only took me about 5 hours). This is a great puzzle game that I would even recommend to people that don't like puzzle games. The atmosphere, vibes and mind bending puzzles are worth experiencing, just don't go in expecting a narrative of any kind.. Solid, fun, and engaging puzzles and boss fights. Some are rather developed, but not in a way that is too strenuous or time-consuming. Definitely recommend.. It was pretty good. Interesting and unusual puzzles, with some physics to discover. I liked how it was forgiving in that you didn’t have to remember your exact path back, as paths tend to lead back to known places. The recursion got tricky but not impossible.. Very clever puzzle game with great music, fun bosses and interesting level design.. A masterpiece. Perfect balance of hard and easy challenges. Unique world, perfect quality. Had a great time.. only worth 12.50 dollar. - 3 - 4 hour long. -easy puzzles adventure no enemy with some bosses but very late game become good challenge, disappointment no final boss, open ending and short 4 the price. -good graphic and bosses.. cocoon is a real masterpiece and at the moment it will be my favorite indie game of all time because there is such a set of unique mechanics, musical accompaniment, intuitive understanding of worlds that are far from us and at the same time wonderful bosses, although there is no combat system itself, it’s wonderful, truly Wonderful. What I don't understan is all this Game of the Year ****'s just interesting with somewhat interesting design and only one idea. It is not nowhere near Inside. I gave it additional point for design only.. Very interesting and unique set of core mechanics that drive the majority of puzzles and exploration. There were a handful of repeated shape-matching puzzles that felt out-of-place and a bit insulting when paired with the crafted world-shifting, but they took up very little time in proportion to all the cool stuff Cocoon does. I wish there were more puzzles that pushed the mechanics toward the end of the game, because I feel that there's still a lot of potential that was left on the table. Visually and auditorily, Cocoon is fantastic. Each area is totally distinct and helps in remembering which plane of existence you're on. Sound and music also communicated the scale of the world along with reinforcing when I was close to solving a puzzle; the music comes in a bit louder and more confident as you reach a solution. This was always clear and never felt as though it was overbearing or didn't match when I had mentally solved whatever puzzle I was working on; the game and I were always on the same page. What's in Cocoon is, for the most part, very very good, and what isn't so great is pretty minor. I wish there was more that pushed the systems that exist within the game because they're so unique and polished.. WOWim playing video game above 32 years ( from atari )this game deserve GAME OF THE YEARjust WOW. Amazing game for two evenings! Creative puzzles and beautiful graphics. Highly recommend. Cocoon is a simplistic puzzle game with very vague stakes. You play as some sort of humanoid insect person, and you are solving puzzles. The central conceit of the game is that you are jumping between worlds, with each world contained in an orb. Place these orbs on certain places, and you can jump into the world inside of them; there are bouncy platforms in each world which will launch you out of the world back to the main world. This is a one-button game; you have directional controls, and you have an action button, which lets you pick up a sphere, place it on a designated position (you can’t drop them wherever you want, you have to put them on stands), activate things in the environment, and activate your currently carried sphere’s special power once you unlock it. While this seems very simple – and it is – the game manages to do a number of quite clever things with it, leading to increasingly clever puzzles as you unlock more and more of the spheres. As you get more of them, you have to do ever more elaborate puzzles involving jumping between spheres and manipulating them to get across obstacles, and by the end of it, it has added some additional ways of getting between spheres that further increases the game’s ability to use these simple mechanics and push them to their **** game’s puzzles are actually quite clever overall, and I think that the game did some interesting things with them – this is one of the best games that involves nothing more complicated than moving things around, and the visuals of jumping between worlds are quite cool. However, while the game’s puzzles are pretty clever overall, it’s not Portal; this is a pretty mechanically simple game, and while it ends up making the puzzles work pretty well, I honestly don’t know why this game is so hyped up. It’s definitely a decent puzzle game, but I didn’t feel like the puzzles were as clever as they were in, say, The Talos Principle 2; the game’s puzzles are all pretty simple and straightforward, and while there are some clever bits in there, you’re unlikely to ever get stuck, as the game is very deliberate in limiting the number of options, which helps you to find the solution as there’s only a small possibility space. That said, if you do like puzzles, it’s certainly clever enough. The game, rather unexpectedly, has boss fights as well; there’s not a huge number of them, but they work well enough, and they help mix things up and add a bit of action-based excitement. If you get caught by the boss, you get chucked up out of the sphere you’re inside, allowing you to go back in and go fight the boss again, and none of them are overly difficult or long. It works pretty well, and once you figure out that there are bosses, you have something to look forward to, as beating them is what unlocks the sphere’s special powers, leading to some new puzzles. Overall, the gameplay works well enough, and I thought it was quite decent; the game also knew it didn’t have TOO many ideas, so it kept things short, with a 100% play time of under 6 hours – in fact, it was likely under 5 hours, as I spent some time chatting to friends while playing. On the other hand, story wise, this game is very, very weak indeed. You are some sort of humanoid insect, but what your agenda is – what your purpose in doing the things you’re doing – is never really made clear, and this isn’t the kind of game that has audio logs or any sort of text descriptions in it. There’s honestly very little if any story to speak of, and while I think that the creators had some ideas in this regard, the game does a poor job of communicating them. As such, if you are a more narrative-focused player, you will find literally nothing here – go play Portal or The Talos Principle. Overall, this is a very decent puzzle game, and worth playing if you like the genre – but I feel like the 88 metacritic score makes this seem like a really amazing game, but I thought it was merely quite decent for what it was, but nothing that I think you’re missing out if you never play it. I liked my time with this game well enough, and if you like puzzle games, you probably will too – but it’s a good game, not a great one. Go in with that expectation in mind, and you’ll probably come away satisfied; go in expecting this to be the puzzle game of the year, though, and you probably won’t find it to quite reach those heights.. Easy 9/10 Its simple game, if you like puzzle. With a beatufiul alien world ambience, we will easily lost time to play this awesome games. I really enjoyed playing it, if there is negatif about this games is that i cant played it again from beginning.. One of the best games of 2023 and probably the 2nd or the best indie. Masterpiece. .. The only word that can describe this game is PERFECTION The game doesn't need to tell you anything to guide you across the levels, the desing is simply a master piece, the music, the ambience and the gamplay are awesome. I can also say that this is going to be the closest experience to consuming d r u g s that I have ever had in my life.. Cocoon left me a bittersweet taste, it started off very strong and for the first 3 hours I was thoroughly enjoying it, however as the game progressed, a sense of frustration set in. I really liked that my brain was tested to the different and challenging puzzles but the progression was really slow in the later stages of the game with a lot backtracking and puzzle after another puzzle and so on so forth. It kind of felt tedious and repetitive. Art direction and environments were fantastic and also some really cool ideas. Pros: + Fantastic art direction + Good ambience music + Creative ideas and puzzles Cons: - A lot of backtracking - Some puzzles can really frustrate you - Game didn't evolve much and felt repetitive especially towards the later stages. Cacoon"" is a tricky puzzle game that makes you think. It's fun, but watch out because the last parts are super hard. The orbs in the game are cool because you can use them in lots of different ways. It's like a brain workout. Just be ready for some seriously tough levels toward the end. If you like puzzles that really make you think, ""Cacoon"" is the game for you. Very enjoyable, easy mechanics, puzzles are try-and-error sometimes but most of the time you just think your way through. Boss-fights are challenging but not too much. I liked the art design and the overall graphics aspect of the game.. I was slightly disappointed by Cocoon. It's a solid puzzle game, no doubt, but despite it's unique idea for a core mechanic the game failed to really wow me with any eye-opening or mind-blowing perspective shifts that the best in the puzzle genre provide. There was a single section that came very close near the end of the game that finally felt like it was this game's ""thinking with cocoons"" moment, but sadly this turned out to be the peak, rather than foundation for more interesting and mind-bending puzzles. Still, it's not fair to expect every game to completely blow my mind with exciting puzzling revelations like Portal, Tunic or Baba Is You. Unfortunately I found other elements such as narrative and gameplay also somewhat lacking. The narrative certainly is mysterious and I was looking forward to learning just what was going on in this world. Why am I this character? Why am I solving puzzles? What are these orbs and the other creatures I encounter? Sadly, the game doesn't provide any satisfying answers at all. I don't mind a few certain things being left open to interpretation, but Cocoon is a game where any actual narrative is going to be vastly more personal interpretation than anything else. There is no narrative - just a loose theme. Finally, while there is no truly sinful puzzle design requiring unreasonable amounts of busywork, it's undeniable that I quite often found myself feeling a certain level of tedium interfacing with the puzzle mechanics. Some of this is unavoidable, but it's not very fun having to backtrack multiple times to carry orbs and some of the ""hold button to interact"" mechanics took a bit too long. It's also not made obvious that you can swap the orb you're carrying with another in one action (which mercifully I attempted early on anyway), which I can see making the experience significantly more cumbersome for anyone who doesn't figure it out. Overall, while I've been quite critical in this review, Cocoon is still an enjoyable experience. For me personally it lacked the challenge and content required to make the full asking price great value, but it is still a well-designed and polished game deserving of a playthrough for any puzzle game fan at least once.. This is another one of my favorite games of the year. The puzzle mechanics were something I have never seen before in a game. The story behind the game was also breathtaking along with the music and each area. I don't have a single negative this to say about this game.. Journey - 8.5 | Design - 9.5 | Immersion - 8 | Enjoyment - 9 | Engagement - 9.5 | Style - 9 | Time Value - 9. the art style is beautiful and the puzzles are designed in very clever way. They can be really difficult as the game progresses.. Beautiful, clever and highly polished. A must-play for any puzzle game fan.. well orgnized level design, impressive art style, beatifully written. a true masterpiece.. There have only been a handful of games that made me scream and applaud at the end. Cocoon is one of them. The simplicity behind only needing a joystick and one button to play the game is truly genius. How can it be so satisfying, challenging, and rewarding with such a simple control scheme? How did they create such an intriguing world? I’m now a lifetime fan of Geometric Interactive and anyone else involved with this game. Anyone having trouble deciding whether they should try Cocoon or not should stop what they are doing and go buy it now.. Cocoon is my idea of a near perfect game. It's not too long, and its art design and puzzles are well done and interesting. I was in love with the world within a world puzzle design concept, its a great concept for a puzzle game and so trippy! I want more, but the length of this game is perfect. I could go for Cocoon 2 though. Cant wait for whatever comes next from this developer. I am giving it a 10 because the game so perfectly and succinctly lives up to its title, ""Cocoon"". Great game, no bad feelings, nothing more to say.. Cocoon contains very enjoyable puzzles. The visuals and mechanics are good. Sounds are also cool. I love the unique graphic style.. Wonderful. A unique and stunning graphic style, incredibly smooth animation and that soundtrack that dents, not to mention the puzzles themselves. IMO Turkey of the Year. The game contains very enjoyable puzzles. The visuals and mechanics are very good. Sounds are also cool. You should definitely play with Game Pass.. Cocoon is a puzzle game in which players use a series of orbs, that each provide different abilities, to traverse a barren wasteland. I’ll admit that aside from a few exceptions (such as Portal) I’m generally not a fan of puzzle games, and as has often been the case with this genre I ultimately found this to be a pretty frustrating experience. Early on the puzzles are all fairly simple, but once you gather multiple orbs it often becomes a mission of trial and error as you try to figure out the solution the developer planned. The aesthetic is great, and I’m sure puzzle fans will find plenty to enjoy, but it’s just not a game for me.. With only 4 hours of gameplay it is among one of the best indie games that have ever existed. 9/10. Fantastic game in the vein of limbo and inside. Great puzzles and beautiful artwork keep pushing you until the end! Great game!. Good game. Imo a bit overhyped. But interesting mechanics, great world and art design, amazing sound design, barely challenging but still entertaining puzzles, short enough not to become boring. I wish more games like this one released.. After playing Limbo recently I was excited to see what their new game was going to be. This was a fun little game giving some great basic puzzles. I really recommend this game to anyone who enjoys short puzzle games with great visuals and responsive controls. Thank you for reading. Enjoy Gaming.. Absolutely amazing puzzle game. It's impressive what it can do with so little.. A Design Level MASTERCLASS. You have to agree. Great puzzle game. very relaxed. Creative setting. Going in and out of orbs feels satisfying. No puzzles that need a guide, though some require thinking for a while.. Good- Wonderful visuals; Simple without feeling simple; Interesting concepts with its worlds-within-worlds concept. Bad- Some puzzles can feel too esoteric or tedious at times. Thoughts- Some puzzle designs aside, COCOON feels like one of the best puzzle-solving games to have come out in quite some time. Its visuals and ambient music do an excellent job of creating a chill atmosphere while you’re solving puzzles, while at the same time easily ramping up the pressure when you take on a boss fight. The game’s minimalistic approach to storytelling also never feels overbearing, and its simple concepts and controls get taken to quite interesting extremes once you zoom out a bit and get a better picture of the world you inhabit, as well as the world you carry on your back.. A Game with one button? Yes it’s the best puzzle game 2023!. A mind melting, perspective shifting, trippy game made of beatifully muted tones and music that reacts and evolves as you slowly figure out each puzzle bit by bit. Completing a puzzle after running around scratching your head for 15 minutes felt so satisfying and empowering This game is an absolute masterpiece that had me on the edge of my seat the whole way despite having not spoken or written words in its entirety. So glad i dove into this game, jump straight to my top 10 favorite games.. What a lovey game. My brains are melted after the last few puzzles, andI felt like genius when I finally cracked them. Well done!. A masterpiece in both artcrafting and puzzle solving. A must play for all gamers. The crew involved in this gets better with each new release: Limbo was very good, Inside was great and Cocoon is awesome!. The mecanisme are so damn good ! Devs exploited full of the main mecanism and re-use them at appropriate time. Artistic Direction is well accorded to the univers. The game is pretty staight forward, no need to explore a lot to find a guardian. It is more focused on puzzle : You arrive in a room, figuring out what to do, try possibilities, and go next. That make the game really smooth, there is no chargement time, get in the game and play. I enjoyed it. It was a real pleasure to spend time in the game ! don't hesitate can't wait to see the next games !. Well damn, that was some creative ****.. Really good game, lacks explotion to be unique. Plus - Beautiful atmosphere - Fluent actions - Eerie characters - Enjoyable sound design - If you play Death’s Door and Tunic this is a similar game but without combat. - I am not a guy loving puzzles and I am not really good at it but I love this game. - Worlds in worlds Minus - I wish this game has combat dynamics as well.. A fun, and simple puzzle adventure. The visuals of jumping in and out of the different orb worlds is wonderful to look at. Puzzles can seem challenging at times but if you get stuck you are almost always overthinking it. The game sticks to simple and straightforward solutions.. This might be the best puzzle game I have ever played. The presentation is immaculate and the mechanic of going in and out of the different globe-worlds will slowly tie your brain into a knot the further the game goes on lol. The puzzles are generally at a good level, too, where they are slightly challenging but still completely doable and the game is also very good at removing unnecessary distractions that you don't need anymore and locking areas behind you so things don't get too overwhelming.. Fun and short.. Cocoon is a fun puzzle game. The story is merely an excuse. The puzzle mechanic is absolutely fun, but the bosses, not so much. I got stuck on the third boss. The timing was just too difficult in the second/third phase. Graphics are superb and great sounds and atmosphere. Didn't see any bugs. I give it 72%. It's good but those boss fights can make you quit.. I'm surprised at all the glowing reviews for this game. I found myself mostly bored while playing it and there are only a few challenging puzzles. There are boss fights to change up the pace, but those can be incredibly frustrating since they are so slow paced and if you mess up once, you have to start all over. The art style was also a miss for me and felt kind of generic, but that's definately subjective. In a weird way, this game reminds me of Scorn, where it seems like it's relying heavily on the art style and atmosphere to capture your attention rather than the puzzles. It does have some interesting ideas, like the concept of carrying around different worlds and having different layers of environments you can teleport into, but I feel like it didn't really do anything interesting with the concept. It's a very short game (around 3 hours or so to complete) and if you have Gamepass it's probably worth checking out.. Loved the art direction. Beautifully picturing different alien worlds. Captivating and engaging puzzles. Enjoyed the boss fights and how the different worlds engage with each other. It could have had some mini bosses to spice up gameplay a bit and vary it from only relying on puzzle solving. The biggest issue is that the game is very short I d want to play more of it. Cocoon is definitely one of the best indie games to come out in 2023. With its marvellous game design, soothing synth background music and fun yet simple puzzles, it is a recommended game for folks who enjoy playing games to relax.. I was taken by surprise by Cocoon. I didn't expect to play it as much as I did, but as it was on gamepass I decided to give it a try and became completely addicted to the gameplay and trying to figure out what to expect next. This game is completely original and a nice welcome to a new IP that deserves praise for its innovation. From the stylistic graphics to its gameplay, and the perfect presentation this game has it all and more. I wasn't expecting huge boss fights and puzzles that would rattle your brain senseless. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and it was a pleasant surprise. If you have Game Pass you should try it, and if you don't have game Pass you should definitely purchase the game.. Very sweet puzzle game. Even if the first half was pretty easy (not considering the awesomeness of scenarios and crazy ideas), the end was challenging and mind blowing :). Really nice puzzle game from the creators of Inside and Limbo!. One of the best game I have ever played..",marvellous game. so much creativity and mindblowing mechanics. i want more of this in games from now on. i really enjoyed this game. it starts pretty slow but unfold in a great way.
527.Lorelei and the Laser Eyes,"Brilliant in all senses. A complex story with deep layers and secrets that happen in a big mansion, the Last Year Hotel. It reminds me of titles that play with the ""meta"" factor like Inscryption or Fez. Fantastic game.. A pure wonder of a puzzle game. It takes a little while to really settle in, but then the magic starts to operate and you just can’t stop exploring and scrapping on your notebook the most unlikely combinations of shapes, letters, figures,.. you keep jumping from a riddle to another, never solving them in the order you had imagined at first, and always with a massive satisfaction when you finally manage to unlock that door or crack that code that has been driving you nuts for hours. Everytime you begin to think you’re stuck, there’s always a little something new to pop in your mind, and there you go again chasing the next hint. Brilliant ideas show up at every corner of the obviously Resident Evil-inspired mansion, but in which zombies have been replaced by abstract visions and cryptic characters. And yet, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, despite all these game design qualities, would probably be just another pleasant puzzle game, if at some points, hidden in the shadows of love, death, time and art, the faceless poetry of this masterpiece didn’t strike by surprise. Another magic trick, and all the exhaustion caused by the efforts you put in frying your brains, vanishes into thin air. Little by little, the atmosphere of mystery, quite casual and overplayed at first, gets more and more sincere, meaningful, and the strange world you boarded in becomes yours, until the perfectly executed and heartfully moving conclusion. Don’t miss this game !. The puzzle game for those that love puzzles, especially number and word-based puzzles. Great atmosphere. You never know what will be around the next corner. This developer is showing they know how to make great games of all different kinds. If you like puzzles, give this game a shot!. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is a puzzle design masterpiece. If you're a 90's kid, and you're used to having a paper and a pen by your side when playing puzzle games, you would most likely have a brilliant time! There were so many times when I stared at the puzzle in front of me for a while not having a clue, until I reached that sweet Eureka moment and felt wonderful about cracking the puzzle. To me Lorelei and the Laser Eyes felt like a tasteful strong puzzle cocktail, and I loved it.. A pearl in the independent titles market. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes balances old-school gameplay with the human mind's curiosity for complex puzzles where the solution is right there at hand. Each solution is a rush of adrenaline that leads you to continue coming across two more new puzzles. The Simogo team has expertly orchestrated the in-game gameplay and another created off-screen with pen and paper for the player but not everyone is ready to face. Lorelei does not accompany you in the game but it is you who must accept the challenge.. One of the most creative puzzle games in years. A very stylish art style and an interesting story that is a puzzle in of itself. Highly recommend!. Great puzzles. The only ones that didn't follow the internal game logic were optional. I enjoyed piecing the story together and the ending sequence was really memorable. Stellar combo of design, small personal mystery, and puzzles. I only knocked of a star for the extended tank controls sections :(. My GOTY for this year. This game presents itself like a noir film with mysterious characters and refined aesthetics, but as you may know, you can't judge a book by it's cover, and Lorelei and The Laser Eyes just keep surprising you from the beginning till the very end. The puzzles are on point and perfectly distributed; they can be hard for people who usually doesn't play this type of games, but the game doesn't require to solve them in a order, so you can shift and try later, which in most of the cases work, plus you'll fell like a true genius after solving them, it's very satisfying. If you feel that you could like this game, just play it, it will be all worthy.. Very good game forfans of Puzzles, very hard tho. I recommend playing with friends and thinking about the riddles together. I was enjoying the game up until the 50% completion mark, roughly 25 hours in, but then the game devolves into a series of ****, unfun, sometimes headache inducing mazes. It's just not dreadful. Additionally the design choices which in the early game are annoying at first, begin to /actively/ punish the player and inconvenience them with no other reason than, ""Haha f*** you"" in the late game. All my good will from the first impressions with the game has been drained away as the end game approaches and the level of player inconvenience and **** ramps up. Really frustrating.. Let's say it first : ""Lorelei and LL"" is brilliant in its aesthetic, and in the feeling of mystery it carries. I get it. The atmosphere is unique - and will not suit everyone, but will be amazing to some others. Some of the puzzles are one of the most brilliant ever seen - especially the ones that revolves around ""gaming itself."" and the most global ones. Yet, i don't get how people can give it a nearly perfect score. The control scheme is utterly annoying and frustrating.. Moreover, while some puzzles are brilliants, some others are just tedious. And last but not least, most of them are only about converting digits into symbols. It's the same old translating process over and over, again and again. It's sometimes well executed, it has some meta meaning, ok. But it's nowhere close to be a GOTY containder. So all in all, ok, play it, it's lovely, it has brilliant moments, and sometimes it's very rewarding. But be also prepared to encounter teeth-gritting stuff. If you are used to ""escape rooms"" games and logic puzzles, you'll see a lot of stuff you already know. And repetitive ****. That does not make it a bad game, again it's GREAT, but it is certainly not ""a masterpiece close to perfection"". Only a good and haunting game, which is already more than we can ask for.. Cool as hell, challenging and inventive, love the style and the general vibes and spookiness of the hotel you get to explore. i will admit to feeling a little overwhelmed when I saw what the full scope and breadth of the final puzzle would entail and that's why I did not beat it. But definitely one of my favorites from this year.. I wish there were more games like this. This is a game for people who like logic puzzles, taking notes, and reviewing things from all angles. The fact that this is seamlessly woven in the story made me unable to put it down. Only a few of the puzzles seemed a bit unfair, with elements being distractions and irrelevant to the solution. Only other criticism is that I wish there were dedicated Back and Menu buttons. The one handed control setup is great and would still work with these added buttons. Great game to play one handed while petting your dog.","a complex story with deep layers and secrets that happen in a big mansion, the Last Year Hotel . brilliant ideas show up at every corner of the obviously Resident Evil-inspired mansion, but in which zombies have been replaced by abstract visions and cryptic characters ."
529.Superbike 2001,"Yeah, SBK 2001 was really great game. It was really hard for me to play it, because it was real simulation. No these arcades like in these days. Great game, one of the best from EA Sports.","it was really hard for me to play it, because it was real simulation . great game, one of the best from EA Sports ."
53.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4,"Incredibly well designed, challenging and fun. Played it again this year and my opinion remains the same. amazing soundtrack, amazing idea, and the side missions can get repetitive and not hard and the maps are great!. Probably the best sports game of all time, definitely try it out, but just a warning, it’s very difficult.. Tomi, shut the hell up. Your life looks the same. And I bet the negative haters are ****.. ive been playing this game since i was a bustling young baby boy and just recently found my ps2 and started playing again. one of the best games out there.. OVERALL - 86% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 7/10 Story - 7/10 Game Length - 8/10 Characters - 8/10 Level/Area Design - 7/10 Atmosphere - 7/10 Sound Effects - 9/10 Soundtrack - 9/10 Replay Value - 8/10 Lacks the punch of THPS2 and 3, but was still a great addition to the franchise. Badass music as always though!. I used to love this game back when I first played it and I still **** that may have changed a bit. 1 I will give them credit for story mode because it was just a 2 minute timer, but they still have that timer where u have to find things or do something in a 2 minute timer. It does have better mechanics though and has great level designs, so the people that complain about graphics why would u? This game came out a YEAR later after THPS3 why would u change the graphics when it was your first real shot at making some better graphics, but overall this game is fun but looking back now I prefer THPS 3 instead.. This is the second Tony Hawk game I ever played and I remember liking it much less when I was very young simply due to the fact that you couldn't get off your board. Obviously that was a ridiculous reason but my base opinion still sort of holds true. This game is great, don't get me wrong but I think the perfect simplicity of the Pro Skater franchise had lost a bit of its magic by this point. It just serves as a slightly awkward middle point between the classic Pro Skater titles and the later Underground games. The 2 minute timer was gone with no story to accompany it. The Tony Hawk engine was created but not yet perfected. The map selection has some gems but also some forgettable areas as well. It has more content than Tony 3 but I'd say 3 is probably the overall better game between the two. It's still a great game though and I have no doubt I'll be revisiting it until I die. I beat this game in September of 2020.. Story - n/a Gameplay - 9/10 Graphics - 8/10 Soundtrack - 7/10 (great but not as memorable as some other ones) Levels - 7/10 (shipyard is awful, overall map quality isn't great as some other TH games either) Replay value - 7/10 (some of the missions make this game not as replayable as some other TH games). THPS4 is a winner! Playing it will grant you hours upon hours upon hours of game playing fun! There are at least 8 maps to explore, plenty of goals,dozens of avatars and customizations. There is a possible secret map that I myself have never been able to unlock. I dare you to discover every ""gap"" in the game, i never could! Thps4 is the best of the thps series from what i have seen.. One of my favorites in the Tony Hawk series! This game is amazing! Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 improved the gameplay from the previous installments and made it even better. Instead of the 2-minute classic mode timer, this game allows the player to explore the levels open ended which makes the gameplay even better, and there's more goals this time. Levels in this game are very well designed with several great places for massive combos. Also, this was the first game to have the inclusion of the Spine Transfer and a freestyle trick system. This game also has a fantastic soundtrack and it's personally my favorite soundtrack in the Tony Hawk series. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 is an amazing game and one of the best in the Tony Hawk series!. Greatest THPS game for me i know lot of guys pick 3 insted of 4 but for me Definetley 4 i spend years playin than bought amarican wastelad gush it was bad THPS4 was masterpiece amazing songs great quests awesome and fun one !. Yet another fantastic game to follow up its previous titles. This game added spine transfers as well as larger worlds, more great music and more interactivity. THPS4 takes everything from the previous games and improves upon them to make one of the greatest skateboarding games of all time.. If you can complete all of the 190 very challenging goals this game has to offer, then you've probably mastered the art of video gaming. It's rare to see a series so consistently awesome.. Great game. In fact, one of the best. Take on challenges, explore awesome environments, and play as your favorite skaters, or create one. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 is a fun, and entirely fulfilling video game for both gamers and skaters.. Some goals very difficult to complete without cheats. Like snake pylon run in kona cannot be done without 'slomo'' cheat as well as 'misty flip' hut gap goal. collect the rivets in shipyard, 'slomo' Some goals require looking up on net to get info to complete-developers were not clear in details, how to's or hints. Many 'reverts' required to complete landings without bailing. The game has a tendency to lose speed in the beginning stages as this is felt by play player going up half pipes,etc. Many 'pro challenge' goals require 'slomo' to complete. Graphics are good for this old ****. Some goals brainy, others stupid. However I would rate this a 7. One of my most cherished PS2 games. The free-skating, varied missions, huge levels that encouraged exploration it all adds up to a very solid title that pushed the series into a fresh direction while retaining and refining what made the earlier releases so great. A lot of people prefer 3 but I personally think this is the best of the first 4 Tony Hawk games.. I've got one word for this game: Outstanding. Even more is packed into this game with over 100 hours of challenges and secrets to uncover as well as a slew of things to do, including free skating, timed high score runs, and Career Mode. A masterpiece of gaming, for sure.. My favourite skating game of all time, sandbox-style levels with quests from npcs, and rpg levelling of stats and tricks, the game design is awesome and the soundtrack is perfect, a perfect embodiment of the world of skateboarding at the time. I could spend all day just free skating the levels.. 9/10 = Amazing = Extremely well designed, very challenging, and very fun. Great sports game.",i've been playing this game since i was a young baby boy and just recently found my ps2 and started playing again. it's one of the best games out there. OVERALL - 86% Gameplay - 8/10 Graphics (for time) - 7/10 Story - 7/10 Level/Area Design - 7/10 Atmosphere - 7/10 Sound Effects - 9/10 Soundtrack - 9
530.Ultimate Fighting Championship,"poor gameplay,poor details,medium graphics,definitively the worst fight game in dreamcast. Keeping in prospective that this was the first UFC game to be developed it's amazing how much it got right on it's first go. I hate to compere versions but while the PS1 game is impressive, the DC version of this game takes everything up a notch. Even though the gameplay feels the same, with the addition of better graphics and smoother animations, it takes a better than average experience into an excellent game. The roster is deep for the time, and the presentation is excellent, far better than any wrestling or boxing game at the time when it comes to looking like the product that you order on PPV. Compared to this generations UFC titles, the gameplay isn't as impressive as the visuals. But whilst you won't be having any technical bouts that go on for 5 rounds, you will have some intense brawls that could last from 5 seconds to 5 minutes, much like the original UFC events themselves, things get physical and brutal real quick. The Dreamcast was the king of arcade style intense quick fixes, and while UFC wasn't a DC exclusive it works best on the little white console.",the first UFC game to be developed on the ps1 is impressive . but the DC version takes everything up a notch . the gameplay isn't as impressive as the visuals . but you will have some intense brawls that could last from 5 seconds to 5 minutes .
531.Medal of Honor: Frontline,"Oh god the d day mission is killing me with ptsd 1000000000000000000000000000000000/10. Great shooter, the best in the series on the playstation 2. Phenomenal environment that causes a banana on the face.. Conventional, correct, just fine. Probably one of the first FPS i played in my life.. Brilliant debut on the playstation 2 for medal of honor. The increase in difficulty as well as graphical updates cement this as an all time classic first person shooter.. This is absolutely one of the best games I have completed, the story is very good and precise, the difficulty challenging, customizable controls for all ages and without a doubt the best of all are the impressive graphics for the time. I don't regret buying it at all and I'm grateful to have it.. AI is dumb as hell, shooting mechanic doesn't make sense, bullet spreading is unrealistic and just can't be described. The story is boring, the graphics aren't unusual. Too long realoads. Everything is even worse than the Allied Assault.. Gameplay wise it reminds me of Goldeneye on N64. Graphics are a little bland and haven’t aged the best. I feel the missions are just a bit too long to not have atleast a mid-checkpoint.. [SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]. Such an ugly graphic but a good gameplay, until to be a 2002 game it is very heavy at certain times of explosions the fps drops a lot Best Honor Medal for PS2. MOH: Frontline is an amazing game that set the standards for WWII shooters. Shame what happened after this game though.. This is the game that I have spent my childhood on. I still remember the all the missions and its objectives. Those times, early 2000 was no internet the way we have it now, so it was hard to find out about new games out there and I did replay that Medal of honor way too many times. Was worth every minute. Game from 2002 could easily beat most new games if remake ever would made. If you play well the game will not take too long. Probably beat in a day or few. But as a kid it took me weeks. Loved it. So if you played the original two games on the PS1, then this one plays exactly the same. It has better visuals obviously and makes for a good counterpart for the PC game only for console players. It has kind of a villain and some really nice on the rails levels, like the mine one. It also has some stealth missions but for me they could have been done a bit better, since in the mansion one, one enemy wouldnt move out of the way no matter what, so I had to kill him in front of his buddy and that blew my cover. If you have a PS2 looking to play some games you missed, this should be on your list.. The first FPS i ever beated. The missions of the mansion and the one in the german submarine are two of the bests i've played in a shooter.. The truth is good FPS games were not exactly plentiful on PS2, something that certainly helped this great game stand out even more. The first mission, D-Day landing à la Save Private Ryan, is totally misleading because 15 out of a total of 19 missions are you alone against the German army, always conveniently justified by a briefing that suggests an “undercover assignment”. Briefing which I heeded and stupidly believed, so there was I, always trying a first stealth approach on every mission which failed miserably with the first enemy I shot. The game simply isn’t designed to be played that way, it is a shooter. It’s as absurd thinking you can beat N64’s Goldeneye never being spotted by the enemy. Level design is great but (and?) totally linear. Lots of door that “won’t open” here. I have no problem with it, it’s 2020 and I’m already tired of huge open world experiences that are 70% padding (delivery boy, crafting, collectibles, hunting, fishing, hiking). Shooting the weapons is great, you really feel the “weight” thanks to the quality of the sound effects and the enemy animations when hit. Plus the soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is simply outstanding. On PC shooters we were used to save our game anytime. Not here, this is hardcore. If you die on a mission, you start from the beginning of it. And some of them take more than half an hour to complete. Imagine my face when I died at the hands of the last pack of Germans. Worth mentioning here I did this recent second playthrough on Hard and obtaining all the gold medals, you can progress faster otherwise. The game is tough from 7th mission on, but completable. I remembered it harder though. When I played it for the first time back in 2003, I recall resorting to lowering difficulty to “Normal” at “The Golden Lion” and got sick of the game when I got stuck at “Arnhem Knights”. If you like old school first person shooters (level-structured, medkits as the only way of healing), you can't skip this one.. If GoldenEye on the Nintendo 64 was the best shooter from that console era, then Medal of Honor: Frontline was the best shooter of the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube era. The very first level throws you on Omaha Beach during the Invasion of Normandy and much like Saving Private Ryan (and for obvious reasons feels just like the movie) it's complete total chaos and at the time, you actually felt like you were in a war scenario. The game after that shifts gears and becomes more like what the series is known for, a one man army fighting the entire **** forces to help win and end the war. Here and there you'll fight along side other allies but for the majority you're on your own. With impressive graphics, enemy AI, TON'S of weapons to use, and movie level soundtrack, Frontline is one of the best games made from EA and one of my personal favorites growing up.. ""Medal of Honor: Frontline"" was one of the better first person shooters on the PS2. Graphically, it pushed the console's capabilities to the maximum. When you fired weapons, the rumble function of the controller kicked on with a solid force feedback. Before ""Call of Duty"" became a cultural phenomenon, MOH was the most popular WW II-themed FPS. This was one of 2002's best shooters. I would rate it with a 9 out of 10.. Medal of Honors finest moment and a real quality game. That D-Day mission was epic and set the tone for the rest of the game. One of the better Playstation 2 games and is well worth a play.. I have been playing ps2 games since I was a kid, and Medal of Honor Frontline is truly the best. And not only is it the best ps2 game, but also possibly the best shooter I have ever played. The games overall design is splendid. Plus the variety of weapons, diverse levels and great graphics (especially for a game that came out in 2002!!) And last but not least, the soundtrack!! Which is really more like a great movie score due to its epic nature! The soundtrack is probably what makes the game so memorable. It makes you want to go back in time to WW2 and kick some **** butt. Simply put, Frontline is the most enjoyable shooter experience I have ever had. And I still enjoy it to this day. Remember how great the first Medal of Honor game on the original PS was? Well, Medal of Honor Frontline is equally good on the PS2. The graphics are simple but nice, the sound is great and most important the gameplay is really good. This has to be one of the best shooters on the PS2. The only thing missing here is a (split-screen) multi-player mode. Also the aiming is sometimes a bit off. But overall this game is a classic. A remastered version of Medal of Honor Frontline was included in the PlayStation 3 version of Medal of Honor (2010) with trophies support and HD Graphics. And since 2011 it can be downloaded at the PSN store. I rate this game 9 out of 10. (I would give it a perfect 10 if it had multi-player). incredible ! best moh ever soundtrack 99999/10 story 9999/10 levels 999/10 grapchics 999/10 .. .. A great fps title. One of the greatest WW2 games of all time as well. It has great level diversity. I had so much of my childhood spent up trying to beat this game and it never happened. Luckily i got better. I give it an 7 cuz i think a grenade indicator was to futuristic for this game as well as slightly longer loading. It has a great soundtrack though and amazing action packed missions.. some of us will probably remeber the original medal of honor on the playstation, medal of honor frontline is very reminiscent of the original, the gameplay borrows heavily from the ps1 classic, with rather impressive level design, all these features combined with impressive (for the time) graphics makes this game highly reccomendable, the game is also rather charming as well, with some humor, but that, you will have to look out for yourself, it does have some criticism though, there is no checkpoint system, if you die, its right back to the start for you, but this is only a minor complaint, the game is available for the playstation 2, xbox, and gamecube, with a remastered version available through the medal of honor 2010 special edition, with updated graphics and gameplay, overall i would highly recommend that you buy this game if you have the 6th gen systems, i have all 3 versions and they are all the same with a few minor details, a triumphant game on the consoles of yesterday!. Thanks Mom and Dad for getting me this game in 2002. I was too small to get past Omaha beach back then, but around 2005-2006, I had a blast. But what annoyed me about this game it that it has ""Frontline"" in the title, yet only 2-3 missions has you fighting on the front while the rest is conducted behind enemy lines. Other than that, the game is really fun. Now Medal of Honor is dying. The only way to bring this series back to its former glory is to return to WWII.. I will never forget playing this game back in June 2002 when i was just 21. It was just so amazing and so different, great graphics, great levels, great gameplay, long campaign, great soundtrack, it just blew me away from start to finish. It was also the game that started off the trend for World War 2 shooters like how Call of Duty Modern Warfare 4 started off the trend for Modern Warfare shooters. So if you want to play a classic game that started off the WW2 trend that lasted from 2002 to 2007/2008 when it eventually died off and made way for modern warfare games, then this is the game. Also great if your a lover of WW2 games.. This game was the best Second World War First Person Shooter available until the Call of Duty series was born. More 'old school' gamers might prefer this now as it is a 'lone-wolf' type of game. Still enjoyable.. It may not be up to par with the games of today, but man this game was the **** when it was released. The controls felt perfect and it had an intriguing (and historically correct) storyline. Worth buying if you can find it somewhere.. Back in the day graphics , physical destructions , huge landscapes getting torn apart with endless bombards and watching soldiers blown away was awesome . But MOHF start to feel rinsed and colorless. The game start to show age , but , its still a piece of innovation even with all this years .. For a bloody old game which has the 3D graphics of a stickman, This game is the best FPS game I and many other have played. You may think im crazy or even on drugs but I am not. This game Is so fun you can just play for hours and hours without even getting bored in the slightest. I had this for Gamecube and one of my mates had it on ps2 and there is quite a big difference controls wise. Gamecube controls are really hard to aim with and you will find yourself either spraying with a machine gun or attempting to hit the enemy and then resulting in, meleeing them. But despite that you will get that hand of it after the first mission. This game is worth every penny and even though it cost me Â£10 at the time I would happily have paid Â£20-Â£30. The reviews speak for themselves. 10,10,10,10,10,10,10,9,10,10,7,10,10,10,10,10,10,10 and then a 0. And you see that 0 and think that guy is 13 years old and thinks that ww2 games are rubbish because he has played mw3. Well that kid is very very wrong. This game is the game to get and for only like Â£1 its a bloody bargain.. Medal of Honor is the defintion of Classic Video Game. For 2002 this game created such a crazy atmosphere and virtual war experience that I was on the edge of my seat for the entirety of it. One of my favorite FPS campaign missions of all time is in it, which is a level where you have to infiltrate a mansion using stealth OR guns a blazing, whatever your wish. It really let for a great, and very challenging level, that I adore and will always remember. The gameplay is classic, the soundtrack is classic, the graphics are classic. This game oozes with classic!!. This is one of those games that was just well made, it has a good story, and a outstanding soundtrack, and a good selection of World War 2 weapons, it has epic set pieces that would make the Call of Duty series jealous, and some beautiful locations, my only complaints are that targeting isn't easy do to a bad reticle, and the ending is more Sci-Fi shooter than World War 2 shooter it reminded me of Star Wars, these flaws aside you have one of the best shooters ever.. Absolutely incredible, haters don't have any idea of how much of a masterpiece this is. This IS the greatest World War 2 first person shooter ever devised.",ptsd 10000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 . brilliant debut on the playstation 2 for medal of honor . if you play well the game will not take too long. Probably beat in a day or few.
